The S&P 500 index is a basket of 500 of the largest U.S. stocks, weighted by market capitalization. The index is widely considered to be the best indicator of how large U.S. stocks are performing on a day-to-day basis.
Composition of the S&P 500
As we mentioned, the S&P 500 consists of 500 large-cap U.S. stocks, which combine for about 80% of all U.S. market capitalization. For this reason, the S&P 500 is considered to be a good indicator of how the U.S. markets are doing.
To be added to the S&P 500, the following criteria must be met:

It must be a U.S. company.
The market cap must be $5.3 billion or more.
The public float must consist of at least 50% of outstanding shares.
It must have positive reported earnings in the most recent quarter, as well as over the four most recent quarters.
The stock must have an active market and must trade for a reasonable share price.

Meeting these criteria isn't a guarantee that a stock will join the S&P 500 -- these are just the minimum requirements.
As of May 31, 2016, the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 are:

Apple
Microsoft
ExxonMobil
Johnson & Johnson
General Electric
Amazon.com
Facebook
Berkshire Hathaway (B shares)
AT&T
JPMorgan Chase

Weighting of the S&P 500
As we mentioned, the index is weighted by market capitalization.
Market-cap weighting means that the portion of the index represented by each company is proportional to its market capitalization. For example, Apple is the largest component of the S&P 500, and its market cap is equal to about 2.9% of the index total, so this much of the index is dependent on Apple's performance.
Unlike the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is price-weighted, the S&P 500 is considered a better picture of how stocks (and therefore investors) are doing since it is influenced more by the performance of larger companies that make up more of investors' portfolios.

How to invest in all 500 stocks
If you want to invest in the S&P 500, it's generally not practical to actually purchase shares of all 500 stocks. However, you can get exposure to all 500, in their corresponding weights, by investing in a S&P 500 index fund.
These come in the form of mutual funds or ETFs. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) is a popular example. It has over $230 billion in net assets, spread out proportionally among all of the stocks in the S&P 500 index. And its rock-bottom 0.05% expense ratio won't eat up too much of your profits.

http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/05/10/the-3-best-sp-500-index-funds.aspx,2017-05-10,"
If you want your portfolio to grow with American business, and don't want to choose individual stocks, a S&P 500 index fund could be a smart choice for you. In fact, legendary investor Warren Buffett has said several times that low-cost index fund investing is the smartest way to go for most people, and he has mentioned S&P 500 index funds as a bet on the future of U.S. growth.

These are the three major S&P 500 ETFs, and by definition, all are extremely similar in composition since they all track the same index. All three funds invest in the 500 stocks that make up the S&P 500 index, and all have done an excellent job of replicating the index's performance:

Data Sources: Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors. Data obtained on 5/8/17, and is representative of each fund's performance as of 3/31/17.
As you can see, there are negligible differences between the performance of the S&P 500 index and each of the three ETFs that track it. The S&P 500 outperformed each fund slightly, as would be expected, when accounting for each fund's expense ratio. However, just to put these differences into perspective, a $10,000 investment would have grown to $18,670 over the past five years at the S&P 500's rate of return. Even with the ""worst"" performing ETF on this list, a $10,000 investment would have grown to $18,547.

            });
        


The point is that with any of these three funds, you can expect your investment to deliver performance that's virtually identical to the S&P 500. I tend to gravitate to either the Vanguard or iShares option because of the slightly lower expense ratio, however if you're a fan of SPDR products, a 0.09% expense ratio isn't high by any means, and the fund is a solid ETF choice.

Reasons to invest in S&P 500 ETFs
I mentioned earlier that Warren Buffett has been a big supporter of low-cost index fund investing, and has specifically mentioned S&P 500 index funds.
Buffett's logic is that as a group, ""active investors"" will match the market's performance over time, just like S&P index funds. The problem is that active managers come at a higher cost, and these fees can eat away at your investment returns. Buffett was referring to hedge fund managers when he made these comments, but the same logic applies to actively managed mutual funds, many of which charge expense ratios of 1% or more.
The main reason to invest in a low-cost S&P 500 index fund like the examples discussed here is to match the market's performance (which has historically been in the 9%-10% range annually), while keeping most of your investment profits in your pocket.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-30317');
            });
        


Beware of leveraged S&P 500 index funds
As a final thought, when researching these funds, I came across a list of 15 ""S&P 500 ETFs,"" however these three were the only true examples.
The rest are products known as leveraged ETFs, which use borrowed money and/or derivative securities to amplify investment returns, or to bet against the index. For example, a 2x leveraged S&P 500 ETF aims to return twice the index's performance each day. So, if the index rises by 2%, the ETF rises by 4%. If the index falls by 3%, the ETF falls by 6%.
You can read more about the dangers of leveraged ETF investing at the link in the previous paragraph, but just keep in mind that these are intended to be short-term investment instruments and have an inherent downside bias over the long-term. In other words, a 2x leveraged S&P 500 ETF will not return twice the index's performance over the long run.

",The 3 Best S&P; 500 Index Funds
http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/01/01/the-sp-500s-worst-day-in-2016.aspx,2017-01-01,"
The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) had a strong performance in 2016, rising by double-digit percentages as investors continued the eight-year-old bull market. Yet there were times during the year when it looked like stocks might be poised to fall sharply. Although turbulent periods in the markets abounded during 2016, including in January and in the weeks surrounding the presidential election, the worst one-day performance for the S&P 500 came on June 24, when the index fell by 76 points, or more than 3.5%. That plunge came in response to the first unexpected voting result of the year: the U.K. vote in which residents decided to leave the European Union, which was subsequently dubbed Brexit and threw the prospects for global commerce into uncertainty.
Image source: Getty Images.
What Brexit did
The June vote gave the U.K. the ability to begin the exit process. Specifically, it gave the prime minister of the U.K. the right to trigger Article 50, the provision in the treaty that helped to create the European Union that relates to countries exiting the union. From there, the U.K. and the European Union will start negotiating terms under which the island nation can separate itself from the EU.
What prompted the vote was the fact that Britain has always stood apart from its EU peers. Unlike most of Europe's nations, the U.K. didn't join the euro common currency, instead choosing to retain its British pound sterling as its sovereign currency. In some ways, departing the EU will recognize the U.K.'s already clear intent that it didn't want to buy into the idea of the Union entirely in the first place.
Still, what sent global markets crashing downward was the potential impact that Brexit could have on the world's financial stability. Up for grabs in negotiations will be the extent to which the U.K. allows the free flow of labor and goods through its borders, as well as whether the EU will negotiate some sort of bilateral trade agreement with the U.K. that will mimic what EU members were allowed to do.
Why the Brexit fears didn't last
The stock market reaction to Brexit lasted for exactly two days. Following June 24's plunge, the S&P dropped another 2% the subsequent Monday, closing just above the 2,000 mark. Yet that would prove to be the bottom of the downward move. It only took until July 8 for the S&P 500 to climb back above the level on which it had closed before June 24's drop. Moreover, the U.S. stock market moved to subsequent new all-time record highs, essentially ignoring the move.
That said, Brexit wasn't entirely inconsequential. The value of the British pound fell sharply against the U.S. dollar, and the U.K. currency hasn't regained any substantial ground since mid-year. As a result, those companies that do extensive amounts of business in the U.K. have found their revenues and earnings depressed and are likely to continue to do so for at least the next year. Now that U.S. interest rates are on the rise, moreover, the threat of strong-dollar hits to companies that rely on the U.K. has only grown toward the end of 2016.
The flip side, though, is that the pound's drop has been a boon for U.K. companies. To the extent that British companies are able to keep doing business in Europe, the U.S., Japan, and other areas of the world that haven't seen the extent of currency damage that the U.K. has, British corporate profits are poised to soar. That will result in strong markets, and already, the FTSE 100 in London has climbed to all-time closing highs in the wake of a strong year-end performance.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-90893');
            });
        

What's coming down the road for Brexit?
Interestingly, the actual Brexit process really hasn't gone forward very far yet. Outgoing former Prime Minister David Cameron chose not to trigger Article 50 following the vote, and current Prime Minister Theresa May has faced legal challenges to her ability to trigger the article. The House of Commons voted in support of the Brexit move, but some are still calling for a second referendum to confirm or reverse the initial vote.
Nevertheless, for investors, the fact that Brexit had so little long-term impact on the market is just the latest example of how one-day losses often don't last. Traders panic, but those who are disciplined enough to realize that the investing thesis for most of their positions remains unchanged can stay the course and do well.
Even with the market having gone through some shocks in 2016, many investors remain optimistic about its prospects for the future. If markets remain as resilient in the face of future challenges as they did to Brexit, then 2017 could start up where 2016 left off.

",The S&P; 500's Worst Day in 2016
http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/30/the-sp-500s-best-day-in-2016.aspx,2016-12-30,"
The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) did well in 2016, producing another winning year and extending the bull market in stocks. Even though the index had some troubled times, strength in the U.S. economy and in fundamental business prospects for the index's constituent stocks helped the market overcome challenges and continue its generally upward path. Technically, the S&P 500's best day came on Jan. 29, in the midst of a terrible month that had investors worried about plunging oil prices and rising interest rates. Yet since we've already looked at Jan. 29 as the best day of 2016 for the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI), we'll turn instead to a day on which the S&P climbed just a small fraction of a point less, posting a gain of 46 points on Nov. 7 -- the day before the presidential election.
A premature celebration
To understand why the stock market reacted so sharply on Nov. 7, it's important to have some context. The presidential campaign had been a heated one for nearly two years preceding the election, and the level of animosity between the two major party candidates never stopped intensifying as Nov. 8 approached. Perhaps because of the perception that Hillary Clinton would be more predictable and conservative in her attitudes toward the political establishment, the stock market on many occasions seemed to be correlated with her election prospects.
That phenomenon showed itself on two occasions toward the end of the campaign. In late October, the FBI announced that it had reopened its investigation of Clinton in light of new emails that had surfaced. The S&P 500 reacted negatively to the news, reflecting the investigation's potential downward impact on Clinton's election prospects.
Image source: Hillary Clinton for President.
But then, over the weekend preceding the election, the FBI came back with its assessment of the new evidence, finding that it didn't justify any further investigation. That seemed to reinvigorate Clinton's chances of winning the election, and the S&P 500 reacted with a rebound that sent it up more than 2%, falling just shy of scoring its largest advance in index points for 2016.
Of course, we all know what happened next. Donald Trump shocked the world by defying pollsters and winning the election. Moreover, even though many analysts had predicted huge declines in the stock market in the event of a Trump victory, negative sentiment in the U.S. financial markets lasted only a matter of hours following the election results. Quickly, an end-of-year rally took hold that lifted stock markets to even further heights.
Why the move was right but the reason was wrong
The 2016 presidential election certainly wasn't the only time that the stock market's predictions of a key even turned out to be inconsistent with its subsequent behavior. When the U.K. voted to leave the European Union in the Brexit decision earlier in 2016, investors initially panicked, fearing a major change in the global economic environment that could have had systemic ramifications for the entire financial system. Yet those fears turned out to be overblown, and stock markets quickly rebounded from their immediate reaction to push higher.
What has turned out to be consistently true is that stock market investors often prefer the certainty of knowing how a given event has turned out, even if they don't necessarily get the result they expected. Even what's perceived as a negative outcome is at least a known outcome, and investors can stop worrying about potential worst-case scenarios and deal with reality going forward.
Moreover, the election campaign was full of emotional responses among voters. That might be completely appropriate in the political world, but the stock market tends to punish investors who react emotionally with their investment portfolios.

How to win on future best days
If anything, the best lesson investors can learn from the S&P's best days in 2016 is that the justifications that market participants come up with to explain short-term moves in the market can obscure the longer-term trends that are the true drivers of market performance. Trying to predict those short-term moves can get you in trouble and make you miss out on what turn out to be some of the biggest positive moves in the market.
In a solid year for the S&P 500, Nov. 7 stands out as a key day for the index. Yet those who celebrated the news on that day and then subsequently sold out when the election results didn't pan out the way they had expected missed out on even larger gains. That's one reason why remaining invested for the long run has advantages over trying to trade short-term events.

The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) did quite well in 2016, finishing the year with a total return of about 12%. That was far better than 2015's flat performance, and new records made many index investors quite happy with the year's results. Yet the top stocks in the S&P 500 did far better than the overall benchmark's return. Let's take a look at the list of the best stocks in the S&P and then draw some conclusions from their performance.

The energy sector is back!
The most obvious source of strong performance among S&P 500 stocks was the big bounce in oil and natural gas prices during 2016. After beginning 2016 at below $40 per barrel and quickly falling below $30 early in the year, crude oil prices climbed above $50 per barrel to end the year. Natural gas did even better, finishing 2016 with a nearly 60% rise from where they ended in 2015.
Companies across the sector felt the impact of those gains. For producers like Freeport-McMoRan, higher prices meant better prospects for bringing future projects on line as well as better profits for existing drilling. For services companies like Halliburton and infrastructure specialists like ONEOK and Spectra Energy, greater production meant higher needs for their goods and services, and that helped drive share-price gains for those stocks as well.

Moreover, companies outside the industry that focused strongly on serving energy companies also benefits. Comerica is a good example, because the Dallas-based regional bank had a higher than average concentration of lending to energy companies in its loan portfolio. That contributed to subpar performance in 2015 during crude's plunge, but Comerica's stock price tracked the price of crude quite closely as it rebounded. Moreover, more favorable conditions for banks generally also contributed to its strong performance.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-842');
            });
        


Indeed, energy was just the most visible of commodities that rebounded. Freeport's and Newmont's gains also reflected strong performance for copper and gold, and the appearance of Martin Marietta Materials on the list shows that even demand for basic materials like construction aggregates was generally better in 2016 than in recent years.
Given how far energy prices fell, there's every reason to believe that the commodity could continue to climb in 2017. The question, though, is how much stellar gains in many energy stocks have already taken future oil-price increases for granted. One thing is clear: if oil doesn't manage to hold onto its recent gains and starts falling again, then the gains on these and other energy stocks will prove short-lived.
Playing the chip surge
Outside energy, technology stocks were the other big performers in 2016, but the top stocks focused on a single sector: semiconductor chips. NVIDIA's top returns came on the basis of the increasing popularity of its graphics chips, which lead the industry and have found uses in an increasingly wide variety of applications. By keeping competitors at bay and looking to capitalize in areas like self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, NVIDIA set itself apart from the crowd in 2016 and could continue to do so.

Yet success made its way throughout the chip sector. Applied Materials was a good example, posting gains as the cycle for the industry turned upward early in the year and helped the company generate better results. A focus on 3D memory chips and more efficient manufacturing processes helped Applied Materials outpace its rivals, and with strong demand for display panels and solid-state drive storage solutions, further gains are possible.

A terrible year for pharma and biotech
It's easy to see the negative influence that the healthcare sector had on the S&P 500 in 2016, especially in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology arenas. The majority of stocks among the index's worst 10 performers have at least some connection to the industry, and although the specific reasons behind each stock's decline differed slightly, the one thing they had in common was a more hostile view politically toward the level of profit margin that most pharma and biotech companies have sought from their approved treatments. Even though the industry rebounded slightly in the wake of the U.S. presidential election, subsequent statements have strongly suggested that even a Republican-controlled White House and Capitol Hill won't leave drug companies immune from pressure to cut prices.
Image source: Getty Images.
Of course, company-specific setbacks are often responsible for big price drops among pharma and biotech stocks. Endo International, for example, has had to deal with product liability issues at its women's health division, competition from a generic alternative to its Voltaren anti-inflammatory gel, and its inclusion among several industry peers in a Justice Department investigation of alleged collusion in setting prices. Vertex's losses stemmed from several challenges, including weaker performance than anticipated for its cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi and an FDA decision early in the year not to approve its Kalydeco drug in treating certain patience with specific residual function mutations. And for Mallinckrodt, issues in dealing with one of its outside manufacturers played a role in recent losses, and more generally, weakness in its generic drug business and an analyst's attack from Andrew Left at Citron Research left Mallinckrodt's stock reeling.
Already in 2017, the tone among pharma and biotech stocks has improved, and some of these stocks have started to find their prospects improving. Yet it's too early to tell whether the broader concerns that many have had about the industry will pan out later in the year.

Handling tough times
Beyond healthcare, the other hard-hit stocks in the S&P 500 had to deal with adverse industry conditions as well. First Solar's losses stemmed from a tough strategic decision to cancel a solar panel upgrade, ending its plans to release a Series 5 product and instead skipping straight from Series 4 to Series 6. That will result in substantial declines in production in 2017 and 2018 as the company makes the transition, and although First Solar has the financial strength to endure a tough couple of years, the longer-term worry is what could happen if industry advances leave First Solar behind.

Meanwhile, TripAdvisor has already made a big gamble on a strategic transition, and so far, it hasn't panned out as well as investors had hoped. Partnerships with other online travel specialists have helped boost volume to its instant booking platform, but TripAdvisor hasn't yet generated the income from going beyond its previous travel-review strategy to justify the investment the company has made. 2017 could bring more progress, but TripAdvisor could also have difficulty dealing with early signs of a return of U.S. dollar strength and other more general headwinds to the travel industry.
Even though the S&P 500 performed well in 2016, these stocks show that not every part of the stock market enjoyed a good year. Moreover, it's not a foregone conclusion that a rebound will necessarily materialize quickly for these hard-hit stocks. Rather, it will take some fundamental changes in business conditions to justify more optimism about the worst S&P stocks in 2016.

To figure out bank stocks, it helps to come up with ways to organize them. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock.
You can slice and dice bank stocks a number of different ways. In the past, I've done so based on their size, type, how much capital they have, and whether they're considered too big to fail. All of these are good ways to organize the bank industry in your head.
There's another way that's also worth considering: looking at which bank stocks are on the S&P 500.
S&P 500 selection criteria
S&P 500 serves as a screen of the biggest and most profitable banks in the United States. You can get a sense for this by examining the S&P 500's selection criteria.
To make the list, a company must, among other things:

Have a market capitalization of at least $5.3 billion
Have a liquid stock -- a quarter of a million of its shares must change hands each month
Be based in the United States
And be ""financially viable"" -- meaning that it must generally earn a profit over the preceding 12 months

By using the S&P 500 as a screen for bank stocks, you all but eliminate the risk of investing in a new, untried bank that has yet to prove its mettle through different stages of a credit cycle.
So, which bank stocks have made the cut and are included on the world's leading large-cap index? Here are the 21 bank stocks on the S&P 500:

Banks of different shapes and sizes
As you can see, the bank stocks on the S&P 500 come in different shapes and sizes, though, of course, they're all big. The smallest on the list, People's United, nevertheless has a $41 billion balance sheet.
You have the nation's four megabanks, all of which have close to or over $2 trillion worth of assets on their balance sheets: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C).
You have the stand-alone investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Although these are formally bank holding companies, getting charters during the financial crisis in order to have access to the Federal Reserve's discount window, they're focused almost exclusively on investment banking.
You have the nation's two biggest custodial banks, Bank of New York Mellon (what I consider to be the most interesting bank in America), and State Street, which serve large institutional customers.
You have a smattering of regional banks, including BB&T, Citizens Financial, Comerica, Fifth Third, Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp, M&T Bank, People's United, PNC Financial, SunTrust Banks, U.S. Bancorp, and Zions.
And you have Capital One, a monoline credit card company that's only recently transformed into a regional bank.

An important caveat
Inclusion on the S&P 500 is just one of many things investors should consider when selecting a bank stock for their portfolio. After all, stocks are both added to and subtracted from the index on a regular basis.
Prior to the financial crisis, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, National City Corp., and Merrill Lynch were all members of the widely followed index. These banks have since either gone belly-up or were acquired by other banks at discounts to their pre-crisis share prices.
Moreover, even banks that have remained on the list have dealt their shareholders serious losses. Bank of America and Citigroup come immediately to mind. Bank of America's stock is still down roughly 60% since its pre-crisis high; Citigroup's shares are off 90%.
But for every Bank of America and Citigroup, there's a Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, shares of which have gone on to new highs even in the wake of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
In short, while using the S&P 500 to identify good banks stocks to invest in certainly isn't a panacea, it can be used as an initial screen for beginning investors who are thinking about investing in the sector. 
",How Many Bank Stocks Are on the S&P; 500?

The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) has been a big winner in 2016, bouncing back from a tough year in 2015 and picking up gains of more than 10% with just a few weeks left in the year. That might not sound like a major victory, but given a tough start in January and February, most investors have been generally pleased with the market's performance. Let's look more closely at how the S&P 500 did in 2016 and what events helped drive its ups and downs throughout the year.

^SPX data by YCharts
Commodities bounce back
From a big picture perspective, the best-performing sector within the S&P 500 in 2016 has been the energy sector. Yet it's important to put the year's gains in context. Even though energy's gains of about 25% for the year sound impressive, they essentially only got the group back up to where they had traded at the end of 2014, following 2015's disastrous plunge for the sector. That stands to reason, given that even with the gains that crude oil prices have enjoyed this year, the current range of around $50 to $55 per barrel is still far below the prices that prevailed throughout most of the early 2010s. ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) was the second-best performing stock in the S&P during 2016, with gains of nearly 150% showing how the midstream giant took advantage of better conditions in the energy markets throughout the year.
Materials stocks were also solid winners, with sector gains of 18%. Both precious metals and base metals posted good advances in many key markets, and copper played a vital role in helping to drive the performance of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), the index's third-best performing stock with a rise of 133%. Freeport has energy exposure as well as producing copper and gold, and that combination helped the company this year even as it had punished the stock in 2015.

Other winners and losers
Beyond commodities, the financial sector was the other big winner on the year, climbing 22%. Most of those gains have come in just the past month and a half, with investors celebrating the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and foreseeing favorable outcomes for the broader economy and the financial companies that help finance its growth. In particular, expectations for rising interest rates have already made themselves apparent in the bond market, and a steeper yield curve is favorable not just for retail banks but also for more investment-centered financial institutions.
Meanwhile, the worst-performing sector of the year was healthcare, which suffered a 5% decline. Much of the year, drug companies got pressure from politicians looking to cut their profit margin on their treatments. Even the Trump victory didn't eliminate that pressure, with the President-elect having recently commented that some drug prices remain too high. The expected revamping of the Affordable Care Act is also creating uncertainty within the sector, with potential winners and losers among healthcare companies with different niches. Several companies in the healthcare space were among the worst performers in the S&P 500, largely because of failed candidate treatments that didn't live up to expectations.

Welcome to the S&P 500!
Each year, the S&P 500 changes its constituent list, and 2016 brought some popular names into the list. Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) entered the ranks of the index in March, having earned its way into the top echelon of U.S. companies by successfully muscling its way into the athletic apparel and footwear space. Stellar growth got Under Armour to where it is now, and even though its recent share-price performance has reflected some setbacks, few question the company's long-term prospects.
A better performer among the newest members of the S&P 500 was Ulta Salon (NASDAQ:ULTA), which has used its unique business model to power gains of more than 35% so far this year. Ulta combines a full line of premium beauty products with in-store salons to help customers get the full-service experience they want. For years, Ulta has grown its network of salon locations across the country, and even in an environment in which luxury retail suffered, Ulta has found the right balance to appeal to its customer base and keep them coming back for more.
Finally, Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) made the S&P 500 in May. Airlines had an up-and-down year in 2016, but Alaska had taken full advantage of fuel price declines in 2015 to produce strong returns for its shareholders. Some haven't been certain about the airline's $2.6 billion bid to buy Virgin America, but a more fuel-efficient fleet and its efforts to become the most attractive airline on the West Coast of the U.S. appear likely to pay off in the long run. Now that the merger has finally gotten approval, investors will soon be able to see what happens with the joint company moving forward.
The S&P 500's returns in 2016 haven't been among the strongest the index has ever seen. But as the bull market approaches the end of its eighth year, double-digit percentage gains for the S&P 500 aren't something to scoff at -- and long-term investors have reaped the rewards of their patience in sticking with the market even through rough patches during the beginning of the year.

Market bounces follow big drops. Image: Wikimedia Commons.
The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) didn't give investors what they wanted to see in 2015, with the index falling by 0.7% and managing to eke out a positive total return of 1.4% after accounting for dividends. Yet even though the index's performance was its worst since 2008, what most investors will remember about the S&P 500 is how it went through an extreme period of volatility yet managed to recover soundly from it. The best example of that came on the S&P 500's best day of the year, Aug. 26, when the index jumped 73 points, or nearly 4%. As usually happens, the events that led up to that momentous day led some investors to miss out on it entirely.
Dealing with adversity If you look back at history, you'll notice that on many occasions, the biggest gains came during periods of nearly unprecedented volatility. The two biggest point gains for the S&P 500 came in October 2008, as the stock market wrestled with the implications of the massive policy moves that government agencies and the Federal Reserve were making to try to handle the financial crisis. Several strong days came during the bear market of 2000 and 2001, with the market showing momentary signs of optimism amid a downdraft that would lop off nearly half of the S&P's value over the course of a couple of years.
On a percentage basis, the S&P's best days are also historically significant. Most were in the 2008-09 and 2000-02 timeframe, but several came in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash, with one particular 9% bounce that was the largest gain by nearly double compared to what investors had seen previously.
Missing out on the strong days Many financial firms love to point out that if you missed out on just a few of the best up days in stock market history, it puts a serious dent in your total returns. The obvious retort to that is that if you miss a few of the worst down days in stock market history, you'll dramatically improve your returns.
Yet the way that up days tend to follow down days suggests just how much more difficult it is to last until the upward moves come. All too often, the strong upward days come in the form of a bounce from a completely unexpected downward plunge. There's no rational way to expect that you could avoid the initial crash, given that it often gives little warning.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-41524');
            });
        


The fear that such a crash produces, though, predictably leads to emotional investing decisions. It can be extremely hard to avoid the knee-jerk reaction to sell into a big down day in the market, especially when you're afraid that an initial downward move will turn into a much more dramatic sell-off. Even the historical tendency for big bounces to occur isn't enough to give most investors the discipline they need to stick things out and stay invested.
Much ado about nothing Perhaps the most important thing about the best day for the S&P 500 in 2015 is that hardly anyone was truly celebrating on Aug. 26. The only thing that the big rebound brought was a huge sense of relief for investors who had seen a huge amount of their paper wealth evaporate in the days leading up to that bounce. Moreover, even after the gain, the stock market would eventually drop back to its pre-bounce levels within a month before finally turning upward for the remainder of the year.
Big days in both directions make dramatic headlines, but in the lifetime of a long-term investor, they typically smooth out and turn into unimportant noise. By keeping that perspective, you can avoid making huge mistakes with your portfolio and stick to your overall investing plan through thick and thin.

",The S&P; 500's Best Day in 2015

The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has started off 2016 on a downbeat note, quickly falling below the 2,000 mark in the first couple of hours of trading in the New Year. Interestingly, many of the causes of today's plunge closely resemble what investors saw on one day in August that turned out to be the worst day for the S&P 500 in 2015. By turning back the clock a few months to see what sent the S&P down nearly 78 points, or 4%, back on Aug. 24, you can find some parallels that could guide your investing this year.
Echoes of a global meltdown  As we're seeing today, global macroeconomic concerns were the culprit for the S&P's worst day of 2015. Between June and August of last year, China's stock market crashed, with the key Shanghai market index falling 40%. Even though this only sent Chinese stocks back to where they were trading earlier in 2015, the drop nevertheless made it clear just how volatile the emerging market's financial exchanges were.
Elsewhere across the globe, financial markets had gotten shakier throughout this period, but Aug. 24 was the day when investors had finally had enough. During the day, the S&P suffered a more than 100-point drop before recovering some lost ground, following terrible performances in the Japanese and European stock markets as well. Especially near the beginning of the session, when the worst of the losses occurred, some market participants blamed computerized trading programs and a lack of liquidity among exchange-traded funds as contributing factors for the extent of the declines.
The one-day decline was the largest of the year, but it didn't represent 2015's low-water mark. The market kept falling the next day, and even after a huge rebound later in the week, the S&P had by late September dropped back below where it closed Aug. 24 before finally regaining its footing in October.
Is 2016 starting where Aug. 24 left off? On the first day of 2016, global stock markets have largely followed this same pattern. The Chinese stock market fell 7% to begin the year, triggering a circuit-breaker provision that led to an early halt to trading in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Weak economic data from the emerging-market powerhouse spurred the decline, and even a 15-minute pause in afternoon trading wasn't enough to give Chinese investors any comfort about the ongoing sluggishness in the nation's economic growth. Markets in Japan and Europe followed suit with declines of 2% to 4%.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-64322');
            });
        


Many of the same macroeconomic fears that prompted Aug. 24's decline are still present today. In addition to China's woes, the oil markets remain extremely weak, putting geopolitical pressure on oil-reliant areas of the world. News of rising tensions between oil giants Saudi Arabia and Iran suggest a heightened potential for destabilization in the Persian Gulf, and some believe that the two countries could open the floodgates on production and send oil prices tumbling even further in preparation for a potential conflict. Commodities prices are also low, putting other emerging economies in peril and threatening to reverse the growth engine that has brought prosperity to many parts of the world.
What to watch out for in 2016 For long-term investors, the fact that the market recovered from Aug. 24 should serve as a reminder that the losses on this first day of the new trading year aren't necessarily indicative of how 2016 will go. Many traders focus on the first few trading sessions of a new year for signs of the direction of the markets in the months to come, but each year is different, and the internal and external influences on stock prices never play out exactly the same way.
With fundamental economic conditions in the U.S. remaining strong, many companies in the stock market have the same growth potential they had before 2016 began -- and before the market's worst one-day plunge in 2015. Taking advantage of downturns as buying opportunities can be lucrative, as difficult as it can be to pull the trigger.

2016 has been a solid year for the stock market, with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) having posted a total return of between 5% and 6% so far. Lurking beneath what seems to be fairly pedestrian gains for the major indexes, however, are a number of stocks that have made big contributions to the success of the overall market. In particular, investors can point to just a small handful of S&P 500 components that have managed to produce impressive returns of 50% or more, and many of them have some common traits that explain their success. Today, we'll look at this baker's dozen of the biggest stock gainers so far this year.

Some common themes
The first thing that is patently obvious from the list above is that the rebound in the energy sector is responsible for many of the best-performing stocks of 2016 so far. More than half of the stocks in the list have some connection to the energy industry, and even though they take different approaches to the business, they've all shared in some part in the more optimistic outlook for energy than what prevailed in the gloomy days toward the end of 2015.
In some cases, merger and acquisition activity has helped stoke higher returns. For Spectra Energy, an agreement to merge with pipeline peer Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) will help create a huge giant in the midstream energy industry, combining pipeline, transportation, and storage assets that will make the combined entity more competitive with giants in the field. To an extent, that has also driven interest in ONEOK and other companies with transmission businesses, as consolidation could help to improving pricing across the industry.
The rise of Newmont Mining also points to some of the positives that have occurred elsewhere in the commodities market. Continued low interest rates have helped keep the gold market strong, and Newmont has been just one of many mining stocks to reap the rewards. More recently, fears about an eventual Fed tightening have eaten into gold's gains, but Newmont still has some advantages over its smaller peers that make it a compelling idea for precious metals investors.
Rising retail and a new tech boom
Several other companies among the best performers in the S&P also share comeback stories. Both Urban Outfitters and PVH have bounced back from terrible performance during the 2015 holiday season, and investors now have high hopes that this year's high season for shopping could bring even more impressive success to the two companies. Retail remains extremely competitive, but the best companies have found ways to adapt to changing conditions while remaining true to their core brand identity. Whether it's PVH's upscale Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands or the irreverent approach that Urban Outfitters takes to fashion, investors have benefited from each company's internal efforts to be more efficient and effective.
Finally, technology stocks have played a role in the success of the S&P, but the two companies on this list are there for much different reasons. NVIDIA can point to the success of its high-speed graphics products and their adoption among gamers as a primary cause for its having more than doubled this year. Its ability to hold competitors at bay has thus far been unchallenged, although some fear that the stock has climbed so quickly that it leaves new investors open to the potential for setbacks if NVIDIA's rivals find ways to fight back.
For Symantec, on the other hand, the big boost for shareholders came in the form of a $4-per-share special dividend early in the year. Tech stocks aren't well known for their dividends, but Symantec made its decision based on the sale of its Veritas data-storage business, combining stock repurchases with the special one-time payout as a shareholder-friendly gesture. With so much potential in the cybersecurity arena, Symantec has plenty of growth potential left for the future.

Be smart about your stocks
Investors shouldn't expect these top S&P stocks to keep rising at the same pace that has created their year-to-date gains. However, most of them are in the middle of favorable trends that could continue, and if they do, then further share-price increases are likely for old and new investors alike.

The S&P 500 may not have the rich history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but when it comes to the most accurate representation of the health of the U.S. stock market and economy, it's by far the best indicator.
Comprised of 500 of the largest companies, the S&P 500 offers a remarkable advantage for investors: 425 of its components, or 85%, pay dividends. Considering that the stock market is undergoing its first correction since Oct. 2011, the importance of dividend-paying stocks cannot be overstated.
With this in mind, and the S&P 500 down more than 10% over the past week, now is a great time to take a brief look at some of the S&P 500's highest dividend stocks and determine whether or not you can trust these yields.
Source: CenturyLink.
CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL): 8.6% dividend yield Anyone worried about CenturyLink cutting its dividend anytime soon can breathe a bit easier, as the global communications giant announced on Tuesday that it was keeping its payout steady at $0.54 for the quarter. With a payout of $2.16 per year, CenturyLink is forecast to pay out 89% of its estimated 2015 earnings and 92% of its estimated 2016 profit.
But could this dividend eventually come under pressure? It's certainly plausible considering the increasing demand on communications providers to invest heavily in new infrastructure, as well as the ongoing exodus away from high-margin legacy businesses (e.g., landlines). In fact, following CenturyLink's most recent quarter, the company announced the layoff of 1,000 employees to cut expenses. Thus, while investors may find stability in CenturyLink's dividend in the near-term, its longer-term growth prospects are cloudy at best, making this a stock that might be best avoided.

Source: Frontier Communications.
Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR): 8.5% dividend yield Rinse and repeat! The two highest dividend stocks within the S&P 500 are both telecommunications companies, with Frontier closely trailing its peer CenturyLink in total yield. However, in Frontier's case shareholders have witnessed two substantial dividend cuts since the Great Recession (as well as a 5% dividend increase within the past year).
So what's the story with Frontier? The company is trying to balance higher-margin content growth opportunities in Internet and cable with previously high-margin landline assets that are declining as wireless access around the country improves. Years ago it purchased landline assets in 14 states from Verizon, and it recently agreed to acquire additional assets from Verizon in three more states. These deals do help the company gain broadband exposure, but they can also be burdensome as voice customers slowly dwindle.
But the key point investors will want to take note of is that Frontier's free cash generation remains steady at around $1.30 per share per year. As long as Frontier can maintain or grow its free cash flow, there's only minimal concern on my part that it won't be able to maintain its dividend.
Source: ONEOK.
ONEOK (NYSE:OKE): 7.7% dividend yield It shouldn't be a big surprise that we find an energy name near the top of the highest dividend stocks list given that oil and gas drillers, servicers, and pipelines have been absolutely hammered over the past year. But natural gas liquid gathering, storage, and processing company ONEOK may be on the receiving end of more pessimism than is deserved, despite halting what had been a steadily growing dividend payout earlier this year.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-70520');
            });
        


Stating the obvious, weaker natural gas liquid prices could rein in total natural gas production in the coming years. If drillers cut their production, then it could be difficult for pipelines and storage companies like ONEOK to land new contracts, or at least land new contracts at favorable prices.
But what matters for ONEOK is that a decline in natural gas liquid prices is also likely to improve demand from businesses and consumers. A push in the U.S. toward cleaner fuels should help grow the demand for natural gas and NGLs over the long run. Also, a majority of ONEOK contracts are locked in for the long-term and fee-based, meaning it has minimal free cash flow concerns until 2018 based on its current payout. It's possible ONEOK's stock may come under temporary pressure from the broader market pullback, but this appears to be a healthy midstream company that income investors would be wise to dig more deeply into.

Most of us are used to hearing on the news about ""the market"" and how it did today, without really giving much thought to just what ""the market"" is. Of course, that term usually refers to the U.S. stock market, and that's typically measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average index or the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) index.
Savvy investors should know more than that, though, so here's a deeper dive into the S&P 500, so that you can make more sense of it and perhaps even invest in it, as none other than Warren Buffett has suggested you do.

It's old
The S&P 500 was launched in March 1957, when a gallon of gas cost around $0.28 and the same year that a young Elvis Presley purchased Graceland. The index originally held 425 industrial, 15 rail, and 60 utility stocks. Financial companies were added in the 1970s.
It makes up most of the market
The S&P 500 has, not surprisingly, 500 component companies. That might seem like a relatively modest number, since there are several thousand companies traded publicly in the U.S. market. It's not, though, because these are 500 of the biggest companies in America, and together they make up about 80% of the overall market's value. Thus, as Standard & Poor's itself says, ""The S&P 500 is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities.""
The top holdings recently were Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Facebook, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, and Google parent Alphabet. Here are the recent sector allocations:

To get into the S&P 500, companies must meet various criteria, such as having a market capitalization of at least $6.1 billion (this threshold changes over time) and a minimum trading volume of 250,000 shares per month in each of the six months before a stock's evaluation for entry.

            });
        

It features dividends
The S&P 500, as it encompasses many dividend-paying stocks, sports its own dividend yield, which was recently  about 2%. There are many companies with fatter yields than that, such as:

It's used to gauge the market's valuation
Just as many investors look at a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for a very rough sense of whether it's overvalued or undervalued, many people take the pulse of the overall U.S. stock market by looking at the S&P 500's numbers. Indeed, some raised an alarm in March, when the S&P 500's cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio hit 30 for only the third time since 1871. That suggested that the index (and therefore the market) had gotten ahead of itself and might be due for a fall -- as it did fall after the two previous high points. (The measure has since receded a little.)

            });
        

It's market-weighted
One of the most important things to understand about the S&P 500 index is that it's market-cap-weighted -- and it's the first U.S. market-cap-weighted index, for that matter. The much older Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises just 30 companies, is, by contrast, price-weighted.
What's the difference? With a price-weighted index, the stocks with the highest prices will have the most influence, no matter how big or small the underlying company is. For example, 3M, with a recent stock price near $200 per share, will have a greater influence on the Dow than will Apple, as its stock price was recently just $152. To understand the wackiness of this method of constructing an index, consider that while 3M's market capitalization was recently around $117 billion, Apple was the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of about $800 billion! Since the Dow is so old, dating back to the 1880s. and has done things this way for so long, though, it's unlikely to change.
Market-cap-weighted indexes make more sense. In the S&P 500, Apple more reasonably has a far greater influence than does 3M -- nearly seven times as much. This system isn't perfect, either, though. While Apple recently carried a weighting of 3.9%, and other big companies such as Facebook, Procter & Gamble, and Home Depot sported weightings of close to or more than 1%, hundreds of companies were weighted less than 0.2%. Indeed, many, such as Harley-Davidson, Western Union, and Mattel, were well below 0.05%, making their influence on the overall index rather minimal.

It outperforms most mutual funds
Many people assume that stock mutual funds that are managed by financial professionals who study stocks closely, deciding which to buy and sell, perform better than simple index funds such as those based on the S&P 500. After all, such index funds just hold the same stocks as the index, with little decision-making required. In fact, though, index funds tend to outperform their actively managed counterparts over long periods. According to Standard & Poor's, as of the end of 2016, fully 83% of all domestic stock mutual funds underperformed the S&P 1500 Composite Index over the past 10 years, while 85% of large-cap stock funds underperformed the S&P 500.

            });
        

It's easy and inexpensive to invest in
Since so many managed stock funds can't beat the S&P 500, it makes good sense to just invest in an S&P 500 index fund. Even billionaire Warren Buffett, known for his investing brilliance, endorses that idea. He says that in his will, he offers these instructions for the money left for his wife: ""Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's.)"" You can do so through many index funds from many fund companies -- just be sure to choose one with low fees, as there are very low fees to be found. A particularly easy way to invest in the S&P 500 is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT:SPY). ETFs work much like stocks, letting you buy as many or as few shares as you want throughout the trading day. A SPY share recently traded for about $238 per share, sported a dividend yield of close to 2%, and charged just 0.1% in annual fees.
Knowing what the S&P 500 is can help your portfolio's performance. You might, for example, put much of your 401(k) or IRA funds in an S&P 500 index fund. And you might simply put much of your stock-investing money in one, if your long-term results so far aren't beating the S&P 500.
",7 Facts You Didn't Know About the S&P; 500 
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/04/20/gamestop-loses-the-sp-500-game.aspx,2016-04-20,"

GameStop (NYSE:GME) is doing everything that it can to stave off obsolescence, but it's going to have to do it with fewer institutional investors on board. S&P Dow Jones Indices announced a few changes to its market gauges after Tuesday's market close, but the biggest move involved Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) replacing GameStop in the S&P 500.
The video game retailer and the provider of payment solutions have been passing ships lately. Global Payments stock has seen its stock soar 54% over the past year, while GameStop stock has taken an 18% retreat. Backpedalling is never a good thing, especially when you're one of the smaller companies in the S&P 500. However, the real issue forcing the switch is that Global Payments is about to close on an acquisition that makes it too big to stay in the S&P MidCap 400.
Global Payments is already commanding a nearly $10 billion market cap, and that will grow to roughly $14 billion when it completes its purchase of Heartland Payment Systems (NYSE:HPY). The deal is expected to close on Friday, and S&P 500 Dow Jones Indices is waiting for that to happen before making the move. GameStop with its $3.4 billion market cap can't put up much of an argument.
GameStop wasn't a lock to be the one to go in making room for the Heartland Payment Systems-fortified Global Payments. There are actually five other stocks in the S&P 500 with slightly smaller market caps than GameStop. However, GameStop's challenging model -- selling new and used video games and gear in a world migrating to digital delivery -- makes it a reasonable selection to be sent packing.
It's worth pointing out that GameStop's penchant for stock buybacks probably hurt here. The retailer has tried to make the most of its situation by using its healthy cash flows to aggressively repurchase its shares. This has helped prop up both the stock and earnings on a per-share basis, but ultimately it eats at its market cap.

GameStop isn't giving up. It has expanded into everything from collectibles to smartphone retail to diversify its business, and earlier this week it formed an indie publishing label to gain some skin in the game. It's doing a lot of smart things, and its chunky 4.6% yield helped contribute a trickle of income to index fund investors. However, it needed the S&P 500 more than the S&P 500 needed GameStop. 
Index funds tracking the iconic S&P 500 will now have to unload GameStop stock, and that could pressure the shares in the next few days. This isn't how GameStop wanted things to play out, but sometimes you just don't win.

Shares of TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) are in a state of ascent early in 2017. The stock has risen 11.8% this young year. That may not seem like much, but TripAdvisor is one of just 21 stocks in the S&P 500 brandishing double-digit percentage gains year to date. 
Investors can use the upticks. TripAdvisor stock plunged 46% last year, making it the third biggest loser among S&P 500 components in 2016. Decelerating revenue and earnings growth has scared away investors demanding more out of their richly valued growth stocks, and TripAdvisor finds itself trying to get its groove back in 2017 despite the stock's encouraging bounce so far this month.
TripAdvisor isn't at its best right now. Revenue climbed just 1% -- and an equally unimpressive 3% on a constant currency basis -- in its latest quarter. As bad as that may seem, it's actually a break from the slight top-line declines it had posted in back-to-back quarters before that. 
The site's popularity may be as strong as ever. Average monthly unique visitors hit 390 million in its latest quarter, 11% higher than its reach a year earlier. However, TripAdvisor did suffer a 10% slide in its click-based advertising and instant booking revenue despite the bump in its reach, a problem since that's nearly half of its business.

            });
        


There's a lot to prove next month
TripAdvisor's best shot at justifying this month's gains will come on Feb. 16, when it reports financial results for the fourth quarter. Analysts aren't holding out for much. They see a sharp decline in earnings, but at least revenue growth is expected to accelerate to a 6% clip. 
Analysts see the top-line growth accelerating into next year, with revenue growing 11% in 2017. Wall Street pros see a more modest gain in earnings. The expected margin contraction is a result of investments in growth initiatives weighing on TripAdvisor's bottom line. 
There's clearly upside here if TripAdvisor is able to boost the monetization of its hotel- and vacation-researching visitors, something that was initially the hope with the integration of its Instant Book transaction platform into its hotbed of venue reviews.
Wall Street isn't convinced. It's been paring back profit targets in recent months. The same analysts who were holding out for a 2017 profit of $2.04 a share are now perched at $1.57 a share, a move that prices the stock at a hearty 33 times forward earnings.

            });
        


Miller Tabak analyst Manish Hemrajani initiated coverage of TripAdvisor stock with a ""hold"" rating last week, concerned about the near- and medium-term challenges of making the integration of its booking engine pay off. The ho-hum reaction isn't fatal, of course. Momentum can turn. A strong report next month can silence the skeptics and possibly woo believers again.
TripAdvisor stock has taken a step in the right direction this year, but it will need to do a lot more to win back all the ground it lost last year.

There's been some big gains to be had by owning Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in odd-numbered years, and 2017 is off to a strong start. Shares of the top dog in premium video streaming have risen 12% so far this young year, one of just 21 S&P 500 stocks with double-digit percentage returns year to date.
Netflix is used to leading the way among the 500 companies that make up the popular stock index. Netflix was the biggest gainer in 2013, soaring 298%. The stock more than tripled after the dot-com darling's once-criticized plan to spin off its streaming platform as a standalone paid service took off. After a step back in 2014, the stock rose 134% in 2015, enough to lead the other 499 S&P 500 components in an otherwise ho-hum year.
Netflix stock has come through with monster gains in 2013 and 2015, enough to lead the pack among S&P 500 components. It's only natural to wonder if the video streaming behemoth with 98.3 million subscribers can go for a ""three-peat"" performance in 2017.
Back to the future
Odd years haven't always been golden for Netflix shareholders. The stock took a brutal 61% hit in 2011 as the Qwikster fiasco played out. It would have to wait until 2013 for a rebound performance.  



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-68075');
            });
        


A lot can still go wrong this year despite its blazing start after a blowout holiday quarter. After tacking on 19 million net new subscribers in 2016 -- including more than 7 million in just the last three months -- a deeply penetrated domestic market and competitive challenges overseas could slow its historically heady growth. 
There were 23.9 million shares of Netflix sold short by year's end, a big number in general but actually the lowest short interest in the stock in more than a year. This makes a short squeeze -- the naysayer-busting maneuver that has boosted the stock in the past -- less likely. However, there are still several reasons for optimism.
Netflix is at the top of its game, and it gained a record number of new subscribers in a year in which it boosted its monthly rate by as much as 25% for its most tenured members. It's earmarking $6 billion in content for 2017, something that will once again distance itself from the competition.  
This isn't the same fragile Netflix that buckled in 2011 or even the one that saw its stock take a step back after its 2014 gap year. This is a stronger Netflix than the one that squeezed out modest gains in 2014 and 2016 between its index-leading romps. Momentum remains in its corner, and as long as the momentum remains, the stock should continue to be one of the lead huskies in Mr. Market's sled race through what promises to be a wild 2017.

Following a terrific start to the month, U.S. stocks are little changed on early afternoon trading on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) (DJINDICES:^DJI) (DJINDICES:$INDU) are down 0.07% and 0.16%, respectively, at 2:01 p.m. ET. Marc Faber, the normally bearish publisher of the Doom, Gloom & Boom Report, told CNBC this morning that the market became ""extremely oversold"" in February, producing the conditions for a ""relatively strong rally"" that could drive the S&P 500 to 2,050. However, he is not confident the market will achieve a new high, and if it were to do so, it would be with ""very few stocks participating.""
Think like an investor""Oversold"" is a technical term and is, therefore, part of a trader's lexicon. For an investor, the relevant question is not whether the market is overbought or oversold, but whether it is over- or undervalued.
At its intraday low of 1,810.10 on Feb. 11, the S&P 500 was valued at 23 times average real earnings per share over the past decade (this is known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE). A comparison with an average multiple of 19.6 times since March 1957 (the era of the modern S&P 500 Index) suggests were not significantly overvalued at any point this year.
As of yesterday's close, the market was valued at 25.2 cyclically adjusted earnings.
But while the market in aggregate may never have been overvalued, the sell-off did create selective opportunities for patient investors, some of which have persisted even as the indexes have climbed out of correction territory.

Apple's products command a premium pricing, but the shares are priced at a discount. Image source: The Motley Fool.
Take shares of Apple , for example, which dipped back below $100 today after having closed in the triple digits yesterday for the first time since Jan. 26. Reminder: The current price is equivalent to a single-digit price-to-earnings multiple (9.8, according to data from Morningstar).
Here's another way to think about this situation: Even though the cyclically adjusted P/E ratio systematically suggests an overvaluation for companies that have experienced very high earnings growth (the early year earnings drag average earnings down to a level that is likely to understate the company's current earnings power), Apple's CAPE is roughly the same as that of the S&P 500.
A 40-fold increase in earnings per shareMeanwhile, over the 10-year period to Sep. 26, 2015, Apple's earnings per share grew over 40-fold, compared to an increase of less than 40% in the S&P 500's EPS over the same period.
Consider that Apple's annual EPS would need to decline by 60% to get back to their nominal average over its past 10 fiscal years. For the S&P 500, the equivalent decline is less than one-fifth (-17%).

Two distinct conclusionsOn that basis, Apple shares are almost certainly cheap relative to the broad market. In fact, the disparity is wide enough to inspire two very different observations:

A disparity of this magnitude suggests that Apple is an obvious buy in this market.
A disparity of this magnitude affecting a company that is at once the most valuable company in the world and (arguably) the highest-profile consumer brand is difficult to reconcile with the notion of an efficient market. Therefore, the disparity must be an illusion.

I have a healthy respect for the market, but I continue to think that No. 1 holds, not No. 2.

Energy stocks got crushed in 2015. Image source: Chesapeake Energy.
To the casual observer, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) looked like it had a boring year in 2015. The index eased downward less than 1%, eking out a slight positive total return after accounting for dividends. But there were many stocks in the index that truly plunged in 2015, and as you'd expect from the drop in crude prices, energy stocks featured prominently among them. Let's take a look at the list of the worst stocks in the S&P with an eye toward finding prominent trends.

Energy gets crushed The sheer number of energy companies on the list of worst performers in the S&P 500 shows just how unprecedented the decline in the sector was. In past years, rising energy producers in the U.S. had benefited from the fact that existing major players in the industry like Saudi Arabia were willing to accept market-share declines in order to help sustain prices near triple-digit levels. Yet during 2015, oil cartel OPEC chose to stop trying to keep supplies in check, flooding the market with cheaper crude in an effort to force out higher-cost producers. Regardless of whether that move might be successful in the long run, a single year wasn't enough for the resulting shock to work through the system and reflect itself in the supply and demand equation.
For many companies, aggressive investment decisions in the past came back to haunt them. Chesapeake is a good example, with the company coming into the year with debt of $11.5 billion, leaving it in a much weaker position to try to take advantage of strategic opportunities in the industry and instead having to fight for its life in the tough market. Chesapeake saw its bond ratings fall below investment grade, further heightening its interest expense, and it is still having to work to restructure its debt in a sustainable way for the future.
Meanwhile, assumptions about how various energy companies would respond to falling prices turned out to be wrong. Many people believed that Kinder Morgan would be safe regardless of what oil prices did, as the energy infrastructure company profits not from the price of oil directly but rather from volumes of production sent through its pipelines and other assets. Yet when prices fell so far, it had an obvious impact on production activity throughout the industry, and infrastructure plays like Kinder Morgan proved vulnerable to the downturn. Slashing dividends throughout the MLP space didn't help either, as companies throughout the sector looked to conserve capital.

Beyond energy Other sectors of the economy had their own troubles, but few rivaled what energy went through. For Freeport-McMoRan, exposure to the oil and gas sector through its recent acquisitions proved ill-timed, resulting in falling dividends and huge losses. But plunging prices for copper and other industrial metals hurt the mining side of Freeport's business, and now, Freeport will have to deal with tough conditions in both of its major divisions. Attempts to raise capital were successful but came at a cost to existing shareholders, and further strategic moves might be necessary to shore up Freeport's finances.
Meanwhile, Micron Technology suffered from the return of price wars for NAND flash and DRAM memory chips. Huge ramp-ups in supply from competitors forced the entire industry to cut prices, eating into margins and leaving Micron and its peers to fight over the scraps. In the long run, most agree that 2015's weak demand will eventually reverse course, as the rise of the Internet of Things makes it more important than ever for an increasingly automated world to have the hardware to back it up. Those who've endured past cyclical swings in the memory chip space know all too well how painful the downward moves can be -- and how quickly they can give way to huge turnarounds.
Energy held back the S&P 500 in 2015, and the declines that many energy stocks saw were cataclysmic. For the S&P to rebound in 2016, energy will likely have to play a role in supporting the overall market and giving investors more confidence in the future.

The Internet strikes back Ever since the tech boom of the 1990s and the collapse of Internet stocks in the early 2000s, commentators have looked constantly for signs of a new bubble in the sector. Even though some investors came into 2015 thinking that stocks like Netflix and Amazon were in bubble territory, they only accelerated their share-price gains during the year.
For Netflix, success with its original series has helped bolster its subscriber ranks, and the opportunity for international expansion has opened new frontiers for the streaming video service. Given the inexpensive value proposition that Netflix delivers its customers, shareholders rightly think that there's more opportunity for widening profit margins down the road. The task right now is to firm its grasp on a potential global empire, and Netflix is working hard to make that a reality.
Amazon is a Netflix competitor in streaming, but its aspirations are much larger. The e-commerce giant has continued displacing brick-and-mortar retailers and has expanded its grip on the retail industry generally, forcing even its largest counterparts to respond on the digital front. Meanwhile, Amazon gave shareholders positive operating income to satisfy those who thought that the tech giant might simply go on expanding forever without worrying about profitability. With Amazon Prime developing its ecosystem, Amazon has plenty of growth potential for the future.

Beyond tech Tech stocks played a big role in 2015, but there were other winners as well. Reynolds American soared after completing its acquisition of Lorillard and solidifying its status as the No. 2 player in the U.S. tobacco market. Reynolds also hopes to expand in the direction of alternatives like e-vapor products, where its Vuse offerings have competed well against the products its rivals have released.
Similarly, Starbucks continued to see a ramp-up in its customer counts, hitting the 80 million mark for weekly transactions and getting customers to spend $5 billion in loading up their Starbucks loyalty cards during the year. Launches of mobile ordering and payment systems, further expansion in its store network, and extension of its Teavana and Starbucks Reserve brands all contributed to gains.
Finally, First Solar benefited in what was a topsy-turvy year for the solar industry. Solar installations have boomed recently, as falling prices for panels have made potential projects more economically feasible. The company has improved its module efficiency, partially catching up from a deficit in the past, but the real strength for First Solar was the fact that its strong balance sheet gave it the ability to pursue opportunities as they arose. That was a major competitive advantage against debt-ridden rivals that are struggling to make past initiatives work, and First Solar's reputation for doing large projects should serve it well.
Even though the S&P 500's returns in 2015 weren't all that great, these companies show how you can still profit from smart stock-picking. These stocks might not match their 2015 gains this year, but many of them have the potential for further advances in 2016 and beyond.

",The 10 Best Stocks in the S&P; 500 in 2015

The S&P stayed largely in balance in 2015, finishing the year little-changed. Photo: Flickr user Hans Splinter.
The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) largely disappointed investors in 2015, closing at 2,044 and finishing the year down less than 1% from where it started. Yet even though investors never like to see major market indexes lose ground, the fact that the S&P held up as well as it did was actually cause for celebration. Let's take a look at some of the challenges that the S&P 500 had to overcome to keep its losses in check during 2015.
Weakness in commodities The worst-performing sectors in the S&P 500 in 2015 were energy and materials, with reasons that are obvious to anyone who has followed the markets at all during the year. Plunging crude oil prices added to already existing pressure in the natural gas market to create substantial losses among energy stocks, with the sector losing about 23% as a result. The worst performer in the S&P 500 was Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), which just barely beat out other players in the energy space with a nearly 77% loss. Even larger declines came to smaller energy stocks outside the S&P 500, as the impact of falling prices on companies with more limited financial resources was even harsher.
Similarly, materials stocks fell about 10% as prices of both precious metals and base metals remained under pressure throughout most of the year. With demand for raw materials from global manufacturers having slumped because of the sluggish economies of many important markets around the world, mining and metals companies had to take drastic cost-cutting steps to remain profitable. Indeed, S&P 500 component Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) fell 70% as it gave investors the worst of both worlds: exposure both to energy and to materials.
Earnings growth disappears Investors in the S&P 500 have had to endure something in 2015 that they haven't seen since 2009: persistent weakness in corporate profits. During the second and third quarters of 2015, the S&P 500 posted year-over-year declines in earnings, and as of the end of the year, analysts expected another round of falling earnings when companies report their fourth-quarter results toward the beginning of 2016. If the S&P does in fact post a three-quarter consecutive streak of falling earnings, it would be the first time it has done so in six years.
It's easy to blame energy and materials for the overall declines, given that energy-industry earnings fell by more than half in the third quarter and materials earnings declined more than 15%. Yet several other sectors, including industrials, consumer staples, and utilities, saw earnings shrink in the third quarter. As the economic malaise spreads across sectors, the chances of a longer-term corporate-earnings recession grow more likely.

New entrants to the S&P 500 It's always interesting to see what up-and-coming companies gain admission to the S&P 500's ranks. In 2015, some well-known stocks found themselves on the list.
American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) joined the S&P 500 in March, marking a watershed event not just for the company that had just emerged from bankruptcy protection in late 2013 but also for the airline industry as a whole. For a long time, most of the traditional carriers had had trouble making their way into the index, as a lack of profitability and frequent bankruptcy filings left investors unwilling to bid up their market capitalizations particularly far.
That changed in 2013, as rising profits across the industry finally convinced investors that the fundamentals of the business had changed. Slowly but surely, airlines have entered the S&P, and American in particular was noteworthy given just how recently the carrier has recovered from its financial challenges to thrive.
Also, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) joined the S&P 500 in July after it officially spun off from parent company eBay and became a separate publicly traded stock. The payments company has been a driving force in eBay's success in recent years as it works to boost its presence in the rapidly growing electronic payments industry. With a loyal customer base already familiar with the product, PayPal is in position to keep climbing from its already attractive position.

The S&P 500 didn't give investors very good performance in 2015, but it wasn't a catastrophic year for the index either. With such disparate performance across sectors and signs of continued weakness in earnings, it's entirely possible that 2016 will present as many challenges for the S&P 500 as 2015 did.

",What Happened to the S&P; 500 in 2015?

2015 has been the most challenging year for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) that investors have seen since the financial crisis, and with less than two weeks to go in the year, it's far from certain whether the key market benchmark will eke out a positive total return for the seventh straight year or not. Although the market swoon during the summer didn't qualify for a full-blown bear market for the S&P 500, it nevertheless reminded investors that stocks don't move straight up, and some now believe that the market is long overdue for a more sustained correction. Let's take a look at some of the factors that will drive the S&P 500's performance in 2016.
Will the economy support higher stock prices? Part of the reason why stocks have seen their returns held back in 2015 is that corporate earnings haven't been as strong as they have in recent years. Plunging oil prices created a major disruption in the energy sector and in related industries like equipment, and that has created a drag on earnings and revenue. Currently, analysts expect earnings to fall by about 4% when S&P 500 companies report their fourth-quarter earnings early next year, and sales will decline about 3%. If things work out that way, then S&P 500 earnings will fall in 2015 for the first time in six years.
For 2016, however, most investors see earnings growth returning to the market. Currently, the consensus forecast for earnings growth in 2016 is nearly 8%, and sales gains of between 4% and 5% could help support a higher market as well. Investors expect the energy sector to continue to lag next year, especially given that crude oil prices have fallen further late in the current year. However, strength in areas like healthcare and consumer discretionary stocks could offset weaker energy-related earnings and promote overall growth for the U.S. economy.
Valuations and interest rates Many investors remain concerned that valuations in the stock market seem high. As of the end of November, the S&P 500's trailing earnings multiple was nearly 22, with a projected forward P/E ratio of about 17. Using economist Robert Shiller's CAPE ratio, which reflects an adjustment for cyclical oscillations in the economy, the S&P 500's valuation climbs to 26. Those figures are generally on the high side of historical norms, but not at unprecedented high levels.
The biggest concern for investors should be whether interest rates remain in check. The Federal Reserve took action earlier this month to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, and so far, the longer end of the fixed-income market has avoided a big rise in rates in response. Low long-term rates arguably make higher valuations in the stock market make more sense, as the fixed-income market isn't providing any viable alternatives to stock market investing. Indeed, the combination of low rates and the risk of bond price declines could help send more money into the stock market, at least until bond yields rise to the point at which they're attractive enough to draw money out of stocks. If rates remain unattractively low, then stocks will look appealing by comparison, and that would help the S&P's performance in 2016.

Why the answer doesn't matter It's interesting to think about what will happen to the S&P 500 in 2016, but for long-term investors, it's not a critical concern. Obviously, no one wants to buy into the stock market just before it suffers a big decline. But given enough time, even a big decline eventually gives way to long-term gains.
For instance, consider those who bought the S&P 500 near its peak eight years ago. Investors endured a gut-wrenching drop of more than a third in 2008, but those who stayed the course and held on have seen the index rise at a 4.3% annualized rate since then. Moreover, dividend income has added another couple percentage points to that annual average.
The S&P 500 is always vulnerable to unexpected bad news, but fundamentally, its prospects look solid. It's impossible to predict exactly how the S&P 500 will do in 2016, but the odds of good gains for the index look as favorable as they've always been for stock investors.

",The S&P; 500 in 2016: What to Expect

Joy Global was the worst performer in the S&P 500 in the third quarter. Image source: Joy Global.
After years of nearly straight-up movement for the stock market, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) finally suffered a correction during the summer months, ending the third quarter down more than 140 points and resting almost exactly 10% below its all-time record levels. More than two-thirds of the index's 500 stocks posted losses for the quarter, but five companies in particular were especially problematic for the benchmark, all losing 45% or more. Let's take a closer look at what hurt the S&P so much over the past three months.
Energy and commodities get crushed It should come as no surprise that the three worst-performing S&P stocks of the quarter have ties to the energy and commodities industries. Joy Global (NYSE:JOY), which fell 58% for the quarter, has long struggled under the weight of the ailing mining industry, with its sales of mining equipment to key producers having suffered from a lack of demand. Miners simply don't have the cash flow necessary to make big capital expenditures right now, and so heavy-equipment sales from the key sector have had a huge impact on Joy Global's sales.
CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) has felt a more direct impact from energy's recent weakness, as the company's strategy to diversify itself out of the coal business has proved prescient but nevertheless difficult to implement successfully. Sales of its coal mines in late 2013 helped CONSOL shift toward natural gas, and with utility customers moving toward the cleaner-burning fuel, CONSOL seemed well-positioned to transform itself. Yet low natural gas prices have hurt CONSOL's profitability, and the company still has coal assets that are also weighing down its future.
Finally, Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) lost 48% during the quarter as it had to deal with a double hit from energy and commodities. Copper prices fell to their lowest levels in years during the summer months, and Freeport's 2013 acquisition of oil exploration and production businesses left it exposed to the plunge in crude oil as well. Investors have had to deal with Freeport's need to raise cash by making dilutive stock offerings and considering a partial sales of its oil and gas business so soon after having acquired them, and with the company's mining operations faring little better, Freeport stock remains under pressure.
Betting big Beyond energy, a couple stocks stood out as big losers for the quarter. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) plunged 46% as conditions in the Asian gaming capital of Macau have stayed ugly. Big declines in revenue in Macau have stemmed largely from the near-disappearance of VIP junket-based gamblers, with charges of corruption and theft raising calls for greater regulation that threaten what in the past has been the biggest source of business for many gaming companies. Like some of its peers, Wynn has a new resort property scheduled to open in the near future, but the slump has called future plans for players throughout the industry into question as investors wait for clarity from Chinese gaming officials.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-45200');
            });
        


Finally, Mallinckrodt (NYSE:MNK) was also down 46% during the summer months. The drugmaker saw substantial gains in sales and profits in its most recent quarterly report, due largely to its acquisition-based strategy. Yet the company cut its forecast for sales of its key drug Acthar, raising concerns about the sustainability of the franchise even after Mallinckrodt had spent $5.6 billion just last year to buy Acthar marketing company Questcor Pharmaceuticals. More broadly, weakness in the biotech industry has rubbed off on Mallinckrodt shares. Unlike most of the rest of the poor performers in the S&P 500, though, Mallinckrodt still stands 50% higher than it traded just two years ago.
The S&P 500 has had a tough quarter, and these stocks in particular have seen a lot of pain. For the market to recover, investors will need to see companies like these five find new ways to boost their profitability and seek out new growth opportunities. Otherwise, the correction could last a lot longer than most expect.

",The 5 Worst S&P; 500 Stocks This Summer
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/09/06/10-highest-yielding-sp-500-stocks.aspx,2015-09-06,"
The S&P 500 index is packed full of dividend stocks -- in fact, about 85% of the 500 companies in the index pay dividends. The average dividend payer currently yields 2.6%, but there are some companies that pay much more than that. Let's take a look at the 10 highest-paying S&P stocks, as well as a brief description of each one.
Two types of high-dividend stocks The average dividend yield among the top 10 is an impressive 6.58%, but there are two main varieties of stocks that pay high dividends.
Some are solid companies with bright futures, which simply have been beaten down due to market conditions. For example, Conoco Phillips (NYSE:COP) pays a 6.02% dividend yield as a result of its share price dropping more than 40% over the past year.
Other stocks on the list are mainly oriented toward producing income, so their yields are naturally high. For instance, HCP (NYSE:HCP) is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, specializing in healthcare properties. By definition, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders, so it makes sense that the stock's dividend yield is over 6%. REITs and telecommunications stocks tend to be income-oriented, so it makes sense that they comprise six of the top 10.

 
 
",10 Highest-Yielding S&P; 500 Stocks
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/09/02/united-continental-is-joining-the-sp-500.aspx,2015-09-02,"
Last week, S&P Dow Jones Indices -- the organization that manages the widely followed S&P 500 index -- announced that global airline United Continental (NYSE:UAL) will join the S&P 500 after the market closes on Wednesday, September 2. The stock jumped 7% on the day following this announcement.

The other three major U.S. airlines are already members of the S&P 500. United's inclusion in the index represents a validation of the company's turnaround progress, as it is catching up to its peers in terms of profitability.
United turns things aroundJust a couple of years ago, United Continental badly lagged its peers in the airline industry in terms of profitability. Quarter after quarter, the company's management team trotted out one excuse or another for United's poor performance, without admitting that there was a bigger problem.
Since then, however, United's management has made a series of smart moves to hold down its cost structure, rein in capital expenditures, and concentrate capacity in its top markets. First, it decided last year to shut down its small hub in Cleveland, which had been persistently losing money.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-81617');
            });
        


Second, United is drastically reducing the number of 50-seat (and smaller) jets and turboprops in its regional fleet. These aircraft are very costly to fly on a per-seat basis, are less comfortable than larger planes, and lack amenities necessary to woo well-heeled fliers.
United removed 45 of these planes from its fleet in 2014 and plans to remove another 80 in 2015. It is replacing this capacity with a combination of larger 76-seat regional jets and mainline aircraft.

A third example of United's fresh thinking was a recent decision to stop flying to New York's JFK Airport. Instead of continuing to lose money at an airport where it has very few flights, United is moving all of its transcontinental flights to Newark Airport, where it is the dominant carrier. It may sacrifice some market share, but it should be more profitable.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-26364');
            });
        


Finally, United is becoming more prudent about capital spending. Following the example of Delta Air Lines, it has snapped up some used aircraft at attractive prices. It also recently swapped 10 orders for Boeing's popular Dreamliner for the larger 777-300ER, which will allow it to add capacity on high-demand routes without spending more money on new planes.
Financial performance improvingUnited Continental still has a ways to go to match the profitability of its peers -- which some of its ongoing initiatives are designed to address -- but it is clearly making progress.
In Q1 2014, United posted an ugly $489 million loss (excluding special items). By contrast, it earned more than $500 million in Q1 2015. United's profitability has continued to rise steadily this year, despite the negative impact of its heavy exposure to the softening Chinese economy. Last quarter, it earned the highest quarterly profit in company history: $1.3 billion excluding special items.

            });
        


The financial benefits from United's ongoing fleet restructuring will continue to grow in the next few years. The end of service at JFK Airport next month and the concurrent move of United's transcontinental premium service to Newark Airport should also contribute to improved profitability. United has been pursuing other cost-cutting moves, too.
There are still some structural impediments that could prevent United from matching the industry leaders in terms of profitability -- at least for the next few years -- but the gap is closing. After several years of pain, United has finally become highly profitable and is generating significant free cash flow, which it is using to pay down debt and buy back stock. The company's place in the S&P 500 index is thus well-deserved.

Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock hit a fresh all-time high last week after news broke that it was joining a select club: Its shares were added to the U.S.' premier S&P 500 stock market index as of the close of trading on Friday, Aug. 28.

ATVI data by YCharts
Joining good companyActivision joins rival video game publisher Electronic Arts as the only other member of the S&P 500's ""home entertainment software"" sub-category. That sector happens to be a crazy-good place to be doing business in at the moment. Over the last three years, EA's operating cash flow has improved from a $700 million annual pace to $1.2 billion. And its earnings have spiked through the same period -- up from $1.69 per share to an expected $2.85 per share this year. As a result, EA is currently the fifth best-performing stock in the entire S&P 500 index.
Two industrywide trends are powering that sharp operating improvement. First, we're in the middle of the strongest generational upgrade of video game consoles yet. The installed base of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 devices is already passed 15 million just in the United States. Retailer GameStop recently announced that to date it has sold three times the number of PS4 devices -- and twice as many Xbox Ones -- versus the prior generation's first 22 months of availability.
There's also the fact that digital sales are reshaping the industry in a way that favors game publishers like EA and ATVI. Purchases of downloadable content, subscriptions, and full game downloads are skyrocketing, turning games into year-long revenue streams rather than release-driven events. And that boost has helped EA's gross profit margin leap from 63% of sales five years ago to an expected 72% in 2015.

Activision earned itActivision is posting similarly strong gains in its operations. Digital revenue hit a record 55% of sales last quarter and, like its rival, ATVI just raised its 2015 outlook for the second time this year. 
People are spending more time playing Activision's games than ever before -- over 1 billion hours per month at last count. And while its perennial blockbuster franchises like World of Warcraft and Call of Duty are still popular, it's the new properties that really have management excited. The Blizzard side of the business for the first time is generating the majority of its revenue from titles other than the World of Warcraft powerhouse. Diablo and two brand-new franchises, Heroes of the Storm and Hearthstone, easily picked up WoW's slack last quarter. 
No one would argue that Activision hasn't earned its place next to EA in the benchmark index. After all, the Call of Duty franchise again topped console sales charts last year.Meanwhile, Activision extended its lead in the kids category with Skylanders: Trap Team and delivered the biggest new property launch in history with Destiny.

            });
        


Foolish bottom lineInclusion into the S&P 500 doesn't mean a thing to Activision's business or to its long-term stock performance. As the index itself warns, ""additions to and deletions from S&P Dow Jones Indices do not in any way reflect an opinion on the investment merits of the companies involved.""
However, the shift does raise a company's profile, which helps boost demand for the stock. That trend is accelerated by the fact that the many financial instruments tied to the S&P 500 index automatically adjust their holdings to make sure they own a piece of all of its members. So Activision's shares could see a small persistent bump thanks to this news. But long-term investors are more interested in how well the publisher expands into new geographies like China, new business models like free-to-play gaming, and new tentpole franchises like Destiny over the next five years. 
",Activision Blizzard Inc. Leaps Into the S&P; 500
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/03/09/why-excluding-snap-from-the-sp-500-is-a-big-deal.aspx,2017-03-09,"
Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) decision to issue non-voting shares through its IPO may already have cost it billions of dollars in investor support.
A group of institutional investors have approached stock index providers S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI to bar the shares from becoming part of several major indexes. Their argument is that one of the criteria for inclusion in the indexes is ""a corporate governance structure consistent with U.S. practice."" Snap's corporate structure is quite unusual, with the founders holding about 90% of the voting rights, and average investors holding no votes at all.
Excluding Snap shares from the S&P 500 may not sound like a big deal -- it doesn't affect the underlying fundamentals of the company. But the growing popularity of index funds and ETFs means Snap will miss out on billions of dollars of buyer support that early investors may have been expecting down the road.

Image source: Spectacles.com.

$6 trillion and growing
Index funds and ETFs are expected to overtake actively managed investments in the next seven years or so, according to Moody's. Currently, investors have plowed $6 trillion in assets into the passive investments. $2 trillion of those assets track the S&P 500 index.
Getting added to the S&P 500 is a big deal. When Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was added to the S&P 500, it received an immediate 7% bump in its share price. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) received a 4% boost upon the news that it would have a place in the index.
What's more, the stocks continued to benefit for some time as active funds that are benchmarked against the index were compelled to buy more shares of the heavily weighted stocks. Alphabet and Facebook are two of the largest companies in the S&P 500. Snap, with its market cap floating around $30 billion, would be more moderately weighted than both, but it would still see similar benefits.
Snap knew this was a possibility
In Snap's S-1 filing with the SEC, it wrote that it couldn't predict whether its decision to make its Class A shares non-voting ""will result in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences."" Certainly, it saw it as a possibility, and it even noted that no other company has made an IPO with non-voting shares.
While Snap's capital structure is different from those of most U.S. companies, it's worth noting that it's not the only company with non-voting shares. In fact, Alphabet has two publicly traded share classes -- one voting and one non-voting -- and it's included in the S&P 500. Likewise, Facebook plans to issue two non-voting (Class C) shares to current shareholders of any class under its approved stock split plan.
But the fact that investors cannot buy voting shares of Snap on the open market makes its situation unique.

            });
        

How will it impact investors?
While having buyer support in the form of institutional investors is a nice insurance policy, it's not the only thing that matters. After all, the primary driver of a stock's value is the underlying company's performance. If Snap can continue growing its user base and revenue at a rapid clip, the share price should inevitably climb to meet its fundamental performance.
There are a lot of question marks surrounding Snap, especially in light of the recent slowdown in user growth seemingly brought on by the increased intensity of Facebook's competition. The potential for several major indexes to exclude the stock make it even riskier.

The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) is one of the most popular market benchmarks in the investing world. Trillions of dollars gets invested using the S&P 500 as the yardstick for measuring performance. Yet there are some things that many people don't know about the venerable index. Below, we'll reveal three facts that very few investors know about the S&P 500.
1. The bottom 100 stocks in the S&P 500 have almost no influence on the index.
The S&P 500 is an index that is weighted by market capitalization. That means that the largest companies have the most influence on the index, and when those large components have particularly strong or weak performance, then their moves will often be apparent in the movement of the broader index itself. Yet the flip side of that coin is that many of the index's roughly 500 component stocks have almost no influence on the index as a whole.
For instance, when you look at the 100 smallest stocks in the S&P 500, their weights range from 0.007% to 0.048%, and their total weighting is a bit more than 3%. By comparison, Apple has a weight of between 3% and 3.5% in the S&P 500, making it just as important as the mass movement of those 100 smaller stocks. If you want broader-based exposure to the smaller end of the large-cap spectrum, then going with an equal-weight version of the S&P 500 is vital.

2. The S&P 500 is a favorite among frequent traders.
The S&P 500 is a suitable investment for long-term investors, but it also gets a lot of attention from traders. Indeed, the amount of trading on the S&P 500 shows just how short-term-minded many market participants are.
To show this, let's look more closely at trading activity on the S&P 500. ETF investors in the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSEMKT:SPY) alone trade an average of 77 million shares each day, working out to more than $18 billion in daily volume. That means that the SPDR ETF turns over its entire share base every 12 trading days. With plenty of other ways to trade the S&P 500, including other exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, and futures contracts, the index's liquidity is unparalleled.

            });
        

3. Turnover in the S&P 500 is fairly high
It's an achievement for a company to become part of the S&P 500, but the pace at which the index changes its list of constituents is somewhat higher than many people expect from such a well-respected and much-followed benchmark. In 2016, nearly 30 companies joined the S&P 500 for the first time. That followed a similar total of more than 25 in 2015.
Mergers and acquisitions are the most common reason why the S&P 500 makes changes to the index, because when two companies that are already in the S&P 500 combine, the merger opens up a spot that the index needs to fill. However, sometimes, stocks shrink to the point at which they are no longer appropriate for the S&P 500 to include. At that time, the methodology that the index follows has procedures for coming up with a replacement company.
Keep your eyes on the S&P 500
The S&P 500 gets a lot of attention from investors because it has become the standard by which investment performance gets measured. Being aware of the S&P 500 and how it is performing is vital in order to determine whether your returns in your stock portfolio are keeping up. At the same time, though, knowing these facts about the S&P 500 will put the index into the proper perspective and let you focus on what really matters to you: producing the returns that you need in your portfolio to reach your financial goals.

",3 Facts You Didn't Know About the S&P; 500

While the market has done well this year, not every stock had a great 2016. It's no secret that it has been a rough year for the solar industry, for example. Not even industry leaders such as First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) have been immune to the carnage. The stock, which traded over $70 early in the year, has fallen as much as 60% over the past six months because of industry headwinds and company-related issues. 
While a pullback was warranted, investors have been overly pessimistic and are overlooking First Solar's exceptional balance sheet. In fact, the company is currently one of the S&P 500's cheapest on a price-to-book value basis. This, combined with the company's solid historical operating performance, should deliver strong returns for patient investors.

First Solar's technology leap
The global solar photo-voltaic industry is highly competitive, with commodity-like pricing on solar panels that's in a state of seemingly perpetual decline. This is great for customers and the industry as a whole, but it forces solar-panel manufacturers to constantly improve their technology and cut costs simply to survive. As such, investors should expect peaks and troughs in profitability from these companies.
Last month, First Solar laid out its plan to jump straight from the company's current Series 4 technology to Series 6. This move will allow the company to begin producing the larger, cheaper Series 6 panels in 2018 instead of 2019. It will also result in the company's taking $500 million to $700 million in asset impairments during the fourth quarter, and it requires production cuts in 2017. Those changes mean lower sales and earnings next year, which investors have responded to negatively.
However, even with the lower sales and increased investment, the company expects to generate as much cash as it invests in 2017. Thus, its current net cash balance of around $1.5 billion is not expected to change significantly over the course of the next year.

A sunnier long-term outlook 
The prevailing view by investors is that 2017 will be a challenging year for the solar industry, due in large part to policy changes in China and the new US administration. While its certainly true that supply has overwhelmed demand recently, leading to a 30% year-over-year drop in module prices, the long term demand projections for solar are excellent, They also continue to be revised upwards, in part due to the increased demand that comes from lower prices.

In their Q4 2016 report, GTM's research team projects worldwide demand to drop by about 7% in 2017, but sees annual total installations growing at an average 12% rate over the next 5 years. Expect these projections to be revised upwards over time. The 2021 estimate alone was increased by 4GW since the Q3 2016 report.

A rock-solid balance sheet
While most solar companies have financed their growth via debt, First Solar's long-term leading position in the space has allowed it to more consistently generate a profit. This advantage has allowed the company to build up a massive balance sheet, anchored by a net cash balance of around $1.5 billion (over $14 per share). The company's total equity was over $5.9 billion at the end of the third quarter, worth over $57 per share. This figure will come down because of the asset impairments First Solar is taking, but the resulting amount should still remain over $5 billion, or $50 per share.

FSLR Book Value (Quarterly) data by YCharts.
In many cases, the balance sheets of manufacturing companies are loaded with plant, property, and equipment-related assets. These assets can very easily require massive impairments because of obsolescence, which can limit the safety of a low book-to-value ratio. In contrast, most of First Solar's balance sheet resides in cash, investments, and projects under development. These assets have a much lower risk of impairment. 
Investor takeaway
With the current market cap well below the equity book value, investors are either expecting the company to require further large asset impairments in the future or are simply being overly pessimistic. Given the company's leading position in the fast-growing solar industry and their asset composition, this Fool believes that investors will soon realize their error in judgement and buy back in.

When people refer to ""the stock market"" being up or down, odds are they have merely heard that the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) is up or down. If you want to be a successful investor, it's important to understand what such indexes really are and how they can help you invest better. Let's take a closer look at the S&P 500.
Image source: Getty Images.
It's old
The S&P 500 was launched in March of 1957, the year that West Side Story opened on Broadway and Paul McCartney met John Lennon. It originally held mostly industrial companies as well as some utilities and railroads. Financial companies were only added in the 1970s.

500 stocks, 80% of the market
The S&P 500 has 500 component companies. As there are several thousand companies that are publicly traded in the U.S. market, 500 may not seem quite that significant. But get this -- they are 500 of the biggest companies in America and together, they make up about 80% of the overall market's value! Thus, as Standard & Poor's itself says, ""The S&P 500 is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities."" The top 10 holdings recently were Apple, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, Amazon.com, Facebook, Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric, JPMorgan Chase, and Google parent Alphabet.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-54746');
            });
        

It's market-weighted
The S&P 500 index is  the first U.S. market-cap-weighted index. The much older Dow Jones Industrial Average (which comprises just 30 companies), by contrast, is price-weighted. With a price-weighted index, the stocks with the highest prices will have the most influence, no matter how big or small the underlying company is. For example, Microsoft recently sported a share price near $60 and a market capitalization near $460 billion, while UnitedHealth Group had a share price near $150 and a market cap of $144 billion. Clearly, Microsoft is a much bigger company -- yet in a price-weighted system, UnitedHealth's stock moves would have more than twice the effect on the index as Microsoft's. The S&P 500, though, being market-cap-weighted, gives much more influence to Microsoft than UnitedHealth.

Most funds lose to it
You might assume that stock mutual funds managed by financial professionals who study stocks closely, deciding which to buy and sell, would perform better than simple index funds like those based on the S&P 500, which merely hold the same stocks as the index, with little decision-making required. You'd be wrong, though. Index funds tend to outperform actively managed funds. Indeed, according to Standard & Poor's, as of the end of June 2016, fully 87% of all domestic stock mutual funds underperformed the S&P 1500 Composite Index over the past 10 years. And 85% of large-cap stock funds underperformed the S&P 500.

            });
        

It's inexpensive to invest in
Given that so many managed stock funds can't beat the S&P 500, it's quite sensible to just invest in an S&P 500 index fund. None other than superinvestor Warren Buffett endorses that idea: He says  that in his will, he offers these instructions for the money left for his wife: ""Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's.)"" You can do so through many index funds from many fund companies -- just be sure to choose one with low fees, as there are very low fees to be found. One great choice is the the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT:SPY). It's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the S&P 500 that works much like a stock, letting you buy as many or as few shares as you want throughout the trading day. It recently traded for about $218 per share, sported a dividend yield of about 2%, and charged just 0.1% in annual fees. 
",5 Facts You Didn't Know About the S&P; 500

U.S. stocks are kicking off the week little changed, with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) (DJINDICES: $INDU) down 0.09% and 0.04%, respectively, at 12:09 p.m. ET.
If you're a serious investor, even if you're a pure stock picker, it's always interesting to keep an eye on factors that impact the stock market. As a direct cash return on stock investments, dividends are one such factor that is hardly incidental.
And here's an observation regarding dividends that doesn't appear to be incidental, either: In the first quarter, the S&P 500's cash dividends per share fell relative to the previous quarter, breaking a seven-quarter streak of record dividends for the index.
A closer look at the data from S&P Dow Jones Indices suggests the decline could well be more than a statistical blip. Indeed, since the fourth quarter of 2000, the trailing-12-month dividend payout ratio has only been higher than it is currently (43.6% at the first quarter) during five quarters spanning the second half of 2008 through the third quarter of 2009.
(The dividend payout ratio is here defined as S&P 500 cash dividends per share divided by the S&P 500's operating earnings per share.)



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-36257');
            });
        


That period was significant: As the financial crisis took hold, the payout ratio spiraled higher, more than doubling, as earnings collapsed faster than companies were willing to reduce or eliminate their dividends (in 2008, the S&P 500's cash dividends per share were nearly twice its as-reported earnings!).
Furthermore, those dividends anchor the S&P 500's valuation and, therefore, its potential price appreciation. In a period of historically low interest rates, investors are not pooh-poohing the cash yield on the index and appear to be unwilling to jeopardize that yield by pushing stock prices up faster than the rate at which dividends are growing.
The dividend yield is equal to the ratio of dividends to the value of the index; an index that is rising faster than dividends implies a declining dividend yield.
In fact, since the start of 2014, the dividend yield has been trending upwards; it currently stands at 2.19%. If interest rates stay at rock-bottom levels, we can expect investors' inclination toward dividends to remain undimmed. Under that scenario, only rising dividends can produce further price gains in the index.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-86522');
            });
        


With the payout ratio at a high level, rising dividends, would, in turn, require rising earnings (that sounds reasonable enough -- dividends are paid out of earnings).
Conclusions: This analysis suggests that the S&P 500 may struggle to post any appreciable gains in the near term as the energy and materials sectors continue to struggle through the brutal bear market in commodities markets. There is one ace in the hole, however, that could help mitigate this process: Financials. Indeed, some of the largest weightings in the sector, including Citigroup and Bank of America have yet to achieve normalized dividend payout ratios/dividend payout yields.

",Is the S&P; 500's Dividend Train Running Out of Steam?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/09/1-chart-that-shows-how-badly-dividend-aristocrats.aspx,2017-05-09,"
Dividend stocks, more often than not, form the foundation of every great portfolio, especially retirement portfolios. And it makes perfect sense why: Dividend stocks offer three key advantages that attract long-term investors.
Here's why dividend stocks are so critical to your success 
To begin with, dividend stocks act as a beacon of profitability. Dividend-paying companies typically have time-tested and profitable business models, and the management at these companies probably wouldn't continue to pay a stipend quarterly or annually if it didn't foresee ongoing profits and growth. In other words, dividend-paying stocks are making investors' weeding-out process of finding their next investment that much easier.

Second, dividend payments can help mitigate the pain felt during inevitable stock market corrections. According to data from Yardeni Research on the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC), there have been 35 stock market corrections totaling 10% or more (when rounded to the nearest whole number) since 1950, or approximately one every two years. While dividend payments aren't going to make up for the short-term paper losses you could incur during a stock market correction, the added income can certainly take the edge off and calm one's nerves.
Last, but not least, you'll have the opportunity to reinvest your dividends via a dividend reinvestment plan, just as the pros do. Reinvesting your dividends into more shares of common stock eventually boosts your payout and increases your share ownership in a repeating cycle. It's one of the smartest ways you can compound your wealth, which is why money managers love it so much.
Dividend aristocrats are kicking the S&P 500s butt over the long term
But, not all dividend stocks are created equally. Among the well over 1,000 dividend-paying companies lies a class of truly elite dividend payers known as dividend aristocrats. These are companies that have increased their payout in each of the past 25 years, if not longer. There are a few dozen stocks that qualify as dividend aristocrats, and they're often considered the cream of the crop for income investors.
As you might expect, some of these dividend aristocrats include brand-name companies such as AT&T, PepsiCo., and Wal-Mart. But there are a host of lesser-known dividend giants, including water utility American Water Works, insurer Chubb, and apparel retailer VF Corporation, which have been putting shareholders first for decades.
The name ""dividend aristocrat"" might make this group of stocks sound somewhat stodgy, but they're nothing of the sort. Since 1991, dividend aristocrats have collectively kicked the S&P 500's butt in terms of total return. The following illustration, with data from Ploutos, illustrates the difference.

Data source: Ploutos via Suredividend.com. Chart and calculations by author.

No need to adjust your eyes: If you invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 at the beginning of 1991, you'd have close to $117,000 by the end of 2016. Considering that the S&P 500 underwent a 50% correction during the dot-com bubble and an even steeper 57% correction during the Great Recession, that's a very healthy 25-year return.
However, if you'd invested $10,000 in dividend aristocrats during the same period, you'd have walked away at the end of 2016 with more than $191,000! That's a far superior return to the S&P 500 index, and an even greater reason you should consider adding dividend aristocrats to your portfolio.

            });
        

Buy one, or buy them all
The thing about Dividend Aristocrats, if you don't know where to begin your search, is that they practically all possess comparative advantages in their respective industries. This doesn't mean you can throw a dart and pick a winner. But over the long term we would expect more of these companies than not to substantially increase in value.

Image source: Getty Images.

A personal favorite is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), which last week announced that it was increasing its dividend by 5% to $0.84 per quarter. This was the 55th consecutive annual dividend hike for Johnson & Johnson. Beyond its healthy quarterly stipend, J&J has a geographically diverse business model, with over 250 subsidiaries, and around three-quarters of its businesses could be considered inelastic. In other words, because people can't control what ailments they contract, J&J's pharma and medical-device operations are always in demand. That means J&J is probably better suited to handle stock market corrections than even most dividend aristocrats.
Or if you'd rather not buy just one or a couple of dividend aristocrats, you can ""collect the whole set,"" if you will, by buying the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NYSEMKT:NOBL). As of March 31, this ETF held 51 S&P 500 dividend aristocrats with at least a 25-year streak of increasing their annual payouts. Buying an ETF does mean paying certain expenses to cover management fees, which according to the prospectus works out to 0.35% annually. However, that could be a small price to pay for exceptional diversity and outperformance over the long run.

Dividend yields current as of 9/23/2016.
The three best buys
Before moving on, it's important to mention that a high dividend doesn't necessarily translate into a good stock to invest in. For example, Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR), the highest-paying company in the S&P 500, has struggled to turn a profit for several years now. In my opinion, it's at serious risk of a dividend cut in the near future.
With that in mind, there are a few stocks on this list worth buying. Here are my three favorites in no particular order.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-28530');
            });
        


1. HCP, Inc.
HCP, Inc. (NYSE:HCP) is one of the largest real estate investment trusts (REITs) specializing in healthcare properties. The company has a dividend yield of nearly 6% as of this writing, and an impressive 31-year streak of increasing its payout.
At the moment, HCP's portfolio is a mix of senior housing properties (40%), post-acute/skilled nursing facilities (26%), life science (15%), medical offices (14%), and hospital properties (5%). However, after some less-than-stellar performance from its post-acute/skilled nursing assets, the company has decided to split them off into a newly created REIT that will be called QCP.
Here's a thorough discussion of the pending spinoff, but in a nutshell, the remaining HCP portfolio will have a much higher overall quality, which will lead to the stability investors love, as well as greater financial flexibility. And the spun-off assets will be in a company whose sole focus is maximizing their value. QCP will have strategies at its disposal that are either impractical, or unavailable, while still under the umbrella of HCP.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-4259');
            });
        


2. Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM)
Also a REIT, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) owns and operates specialized storage facilities, and provides information protection, storage, and record management services. As of this writing, Iron Mountain has an impressive real estate portfolio consisting of 1,100 facilities located in 41 countries. In fact, the company has such a widespread presence that 94% of the Fortune 1000 are Iron Mountain customers.
Storage facilities, while they may sound like a boring business, can be one of the most exciting types of real estate from a business standpoint. They have low maintenance expenses and turnover costs, and tenant retention is generally higher than other types of properties. In fact, Iron Mountain's gross profit margin is 76.6%.
As far as the dividend is concerned, Iron Mountain's 26 consecutive years of revenue growth should help set your mind at ease. The company is currently in the midst of a pretty ambitious expansion plan, known as the ""2020 vision,"" and if successful, Iron Mountain projects its dividend in 2020 will be $2.54 per share. Not only would that represent a 31% increase over the current payout, but the company actually predicts that they will need to spend less of its AFFO and utilize less leverage to make it happen.

            });
        


3. Ford Motor Co.
I see Ford (NYSE:F) as the riskiest stock out of the three that I'm discussing here, but it also has tremendous upside potential if the company's sales remain strong. The automotive business is a highly cyclical one, and even Ford has acknowledged that a downturn is entirely possible in the not-too-distant future.
Investors are worrying that the current business cycle has peaked, and this is the primary reason why shares trade for an absurdly low valuation of just 5.4 times trailing 12-month (TTM) earnings. However, Ford CFO Bob Shanks assured investors that it plans to offer a ""secure regular dividend"" through the entire business cycle, and even mentioned the plan to pay a supplemental cash dividend when cash flow allows.
The bottom line is that Ford's 4.9% dividend is safe. The company is doing a great job with capital allocation, and the $20 billion in cash on the balance sheet makes me even more confident in Ford's dividend commitment. And once sales begin to rise again, the shares have a great deal of upside potential.
The bottom line
There are some high-paying stocks on the S&P 500, but they aren't all worth owning right now. However, the three stocks discussed here offer sustainable income in addition to the possibility of market-beating growth over the long run. Any of these three would be an excellent addition to a retirement or income investing strategy.

Following the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) latest 50-point tumble over a two-day period, the broad-based index that is arguably the best representation of the health of the U.S. economy and stock market is now down for the year, albeit marginally.
Over the course of 2015, the S&P 500 has vacillated wildly between being up and down for the year, demonstrating that Wall Street and investors are clearly indecisive as to what should happen next with the U.S. economy and stock market.
The S&P 500's best stocks in 2015 Within the S&P 500, which is comprised of slightly more than 500 of the largest companies in America, some stocks ascended to the heavens. In fact, through Dec. 3, 2015 there were two stocks that have more than doubled year to date. The big question is, did these companies exhaust their momentum in 2015, or is there a solid enough growth story behind these companies to propel their stock prices higher in the future? Let's have a look.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX): Up 164% After turning in a miserable year in 2011 that saw its shares sink by well over 50%, streaming-content provider Netflix has been virtually unstoppable since. This year alone, Netflix's market valuation has ballooned from around $21 billion to more than $54 billion.
Image source: Netflix.
The major catalyst for Netflix has been its ongoing push into streaming, especially in international markets. Wall Street and investors have come to terms with the fact that pushing into international markets is a costly venture -- as are licensing fees for that matter -- that isn't likely to immediately pay off. However, long-term investors also realize that international subscribers are the key to Netflix's growth, because international markets are largely untapped.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-31405');
            });
        


For example, international streaming resulted in a $68 million loss in the third quarter, and is expected to generate $117 million in losses in Q4 despite steady expected revenue growth of around 10% from the sequential third quarter. More importantly, Netflix's net subscriber additions are accelerating with each passing quarter.
Netflix forecasts 29.49 million total memberships internationally by the end of the year. Over time, as costs in international market lessen, Netflix should begin to reap margins that are similar to what it earns on its U.S. members, which ranges between 14% and 18%. 
Netflix is also benefiting from its partnership with Disney, which was inked back in 2012. The Disney deal prevented new movies from streaming on Netflix until 2016; but with the calendar about to change to a new year, and Disney set to release what could be the highest-grossing film of all time, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Netflix could be sitting pretty. This deal could be critical to drawing in entire households as it appeals to both parents and their children.
Can the good times continue? A lot will depend on the forgiving nature of investors, considering that Netflix is trading at a premium forward P/E of nearly 500, and whether or not streaming rivals can ink licensing deals that pull on-the-fence streaming customers away from Netflix. With a burgeoning lineup of exclusive series of its own, Netflix appears set for another good year in 2016; although, I would suggest tempering your return expectations a bit moving forward until we see an operating improvement in its overseas-streaming segment.

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN): Up 118% Online retail giant Amazon.com is the other half of 2015's amazing duo that's bolted higher by more than 100%. Amazingly, it's Amazon's quarterly earnings reports, which have often been a sore spot for skeptics, that have provided nearly all of the upside spark year to date.

For more than a decade, Amazon.com's strategy has been to forgo boosting its profits, and instead, reinvest as much of its operating cash flow as possible back into its online business and satellite operations. For investors willing to look past EPS as the only determinant of business health, Amazon has been growing at a phenomenal pace.
In the third quarter, Amazon announced that its trailing 12-month operating cash flow had improved by 72%, to $9.8 billion, with quarterly revenue rising 23% in Q3 2015 from the year-ago period. Things look even better on an operational basis -- 30% year-over-year growth -- if adverse foreign currency effects are removed. Part of this can be attributed to the 230% year-over-year increase in Amazon's active customers, and its focus on Prime, which keeps members loyal to the service.
However, a big growth driver of late has been Amazon's Web Services, or AWS. Despite accounting for less than 10% of total revenue, AWS accounted for more than half of Amazon's third-quarter profit.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-23620');
            });
        


Also, per Foolish colleague Jamal Carnette, the company's AWS is on pace for about $7.3 billion in extrapolated annual sales -- an 81% year-over-year increase -- and now counts around 1 million customers. Emphasizing AWS is a smart move for Amazon because it offers substantially higher margin potential than its retail operations. 
Can Amazon.com push even higher in 2016? It's a tough call considering Amazon's $312 billion valuation and forward P/E of 117. Like Netflix, investors have been willing to overlook its lack of profitability, and have instead focused on Amazon's cash flow and top-line growth rate. However, a valuation north of $300 billion pushes the envelope of how much Wall Street and investors can ignore before they demand substantial profits.
In my best guess, Amazon is going to need to trounce the Street's earnings forecasts next year if it hopes to maintain or grow its current valuation. However, I'd also suggest that investors refrain from giving too much credence to the company's quarterly reports, and remain focused on its long-term outlook.

",Are the S&P; 500's Best Stocks in 2015 Still Worth Buying?

Companies that grow sales and earnings rapidly for long periods of time stand a good chance of becoming great long-term investments. That's why why we Fools are constantly on the hunt for stocks that can expand at rapid rates for years, as those which can do so successfully can produce life-changing returns.
With that in mind, I searched through the S&P 500 for the highest projected earnings-per-share growth rates over the next five years. To limit the field slightly, I only included companies in the list that have grown their earnings per share at a rate of at least 25% annually over the past five years. Doing so helps to eliminate companies from the group that have highly cyclical earnings or are only just now becoming profitable.
Here's a look at the highest-growth stocks that the screen produced, and some commentary on whether or not you should consider buying them.
No. 3: An emerging fitness giant
First up is one of the best growth stocks over the past decade, Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) (NYSE:UA). Under the strong leadership of founder and CEO Kevin Plank, Under Armour has rapidly taken share in the markets in which it competes. In fact, the company recently announced its 25th consecutive quarter of at least 20% revenue growth, putting it on pace to generate almost $5 billion in annual sales this year.

Image source: Under Armour.

What's exciting about Under Armour today is that the company's brand is appealing to consumers outside of North America. Last quarter international sales jumped by 68% to $150 million; while this division currently only represents 15% of total sales, there's so much room left for expansion that this division holds promise to become a significant revenue and earnings driver over the next decade.
Over the next five years, analysts believe that Under Armour's exceptional rate of growth will continue, with current estimates calling for EPS growth of roughly 23% annually. Understandably, Wall Street's enthusiasm for the company's growth prospects has resulted in a premium P/E ratio, with shares currently trading hands for more than 55 times next year's earnings estimates.
History has shown that buying the stock regardless of its nosebleed P/E ratio has been a smart move, but with so much future growth already priced in, I'm inclined to believe that buying in stages on any future dips might be the smartest way to become an investor.
No. 2: The top dog in video games
The massive success of Pokemon Go should serve as a nice reminder that video games have truly become big business. For that reason I wasn't surprised to see that Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) held the No. 2 spot of the companies in the S&P 500 with the highest growth projections.
Activision has been churning out hit games for decades, with massive winners like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Skylanders under its belt. More recently we've seen new franchises enter the fold such as Destiny and Hearthstone, which gamers have embraced with open arms. In total, last quarter Activision Blizzard counted 544 million monthly active users across Activision, Blizzard, and King Digital, the last of which it acquired earlier this year. That's simply a massive user base, and many believe that it will only continue to grow as consumer spending around the world increases.
Beyond the gamer expansion, this company has nicely benefited from the gradual shift to digital game sales, bypassing the need to visit a retailer in order to play one of the company's hit games. Combining that trend with the increase in in-game purchases, Activision has been able to consistently grow its gross margin over the past decade, making the company increasingly more profitable.

Given the slew of existing and upcoming franchises, analysts are feeling good about the company's growth prospects. Current estimates call for earnings to grow by more than 23% annually over the next five years, which is quite fast for a company that's only trading for 19 times next year's earnings. If you believe the company can live up to its growth potential, then right now looks like a great time to consider buying shares.

No. 1: The house that Zuckerberg built
Do you remember when the social network giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) first went public and shares initially struggled to gain traction? Media outlets everywhere were calling it a busted IPO, and many wrote off the high-profile company as a potential investment, questioning everything from its lack of presence on mobile to competition from upstarts like Snapchat.
Fast forward to today: Facebook has silenced the critics and gone on to produce phenomenal results, rewarding patient investors who bought at the ""expensive"" IPO price.

FB data by YCharts. Facebook compared to SPDR S&P 500 ETF.
What's so amazing about this growth story is that even at today's gargantuan size, the company is still adding users at a brisk pace. As of the second quarter Facebook had 1.71 billion monthly users, which was up 15% over the year-ago period. Even more impressive is that daily active users grew by an even faster 17%, to 1.13 billion.
Combining those mind-boggling numbers with the company's ability to increase revenue per user, sales grew by 59% to $6.24 billion. Even with continued growth in expenses the company still managed to expand its margins, which propelled earnings per share up 184% to $0.71.
As impressive as all that is, it's important to remember that Facebook has only barely started scratching the surface of what's possible with its other platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. If the company can monetize those successfully -- and its success with its main Facebook platform suggests that's very possible -- then earnings per share will likely have plenty of room to run from here.
Analysts certainly believe that the gravy train will continue from here on out, calling for EPS growth of more than 35% over the next five years. That kind of growth has awarded Facebook's stock a premium trailing P/E ratio of nearly 60, but this company's forward growth rate is so high that it's only trading for about 24 times next year's earnings. Those numbers make me believe that Facebook's stock is nowhere near overvalued today, so tucking a few shares into your portfolio might prove to be profit-friendly.

",3 Highest-Growth Stocks in the S&P; 500 Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/09/is-there-a-better-benchmark-to-gauge-my-returns-ag.aspx,2016-08-09,"

It's mailbag time again on the Rule Breaker Investing podcast, and there are plenty of great questions for Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner. In this segment, a longtime listener wants to know if there's a better way to measure his investing success than comparing his returns to the good old S&P 500 index.  
 

A transcript follows the video.




This podcast was recorded on July 27, 2016.
David Gardner: Let's get it started right away this week with one from Jordan Parcel. Jordan, you wrote: ""Hi, David. Thank you for all of your help and everything you do for the average investor. I love hearing it all. I have not missed one of your podcasts yet."" OK, I need to just pause it right there. Jordan, you rock!
Back to your text: ""Specifically, I enjoy hearing about your big winners and losers, but I find it hard to judge how I'm doing with my investments. I've been following the Fool for about four years and investing for three. My goal has been to accomplish higher returns than the S&P, because if I can't beat that, I ought to be fully invested in ETFs. With your team's help, knock on wood, my portfolio has held up pretty well against the S&P, but I was wondering if you had a better guideline to judge my performance. Thanks. Jordan Parcel.""
Or maybe Par-cel. Although the former coach of the New York Giants and New England Patriots used an extra ""L"" when he went by Bill Parcells, so I'm still thinking, Jordan, I've got your name nailed.
OK, you've actually asked a few questions. First of all, you said you've been following the Fool for four years and investing for three. That's not a question, but I want to say, good job. So it sounds to me like you were following along for a whole year before you started investing. And that says a really good thing to me about you're taking the time to educate yourself and to think about all this, maybe even to save, scrap some money together to invest, and then you got started. So congratulations and good for you.
There are really two threads that I want to pull out of your question. The first is just beating the S&P 500. That's what you've described in your note, Jordan. You said, ""Hey, I'm doing this because if I'm not going to be beating the market, the S&P 500, then I might as well be in ETFs.""
And I want to reassert that that is, in fact, the goal of at least Motley Fool Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor, the services that I work on. Certainly Motley Fool Supernova as well. Not every service for every Fool is designed to beat the market, necessarily. Some of our members, especially older members, don't care as much about beating the market as they do preserving their capital. And so you have popular services like Jeff Fischer's Motley Fool Pro, which is really there to help people try to not lose money, even though it also has a good record of beating the market.
So I do want to just mention that not everybody has this same goal. But at least for me, David Gardner, and my brother, Tom, and the books that we started The Motley Fool with -- the 1996 best-seller The Motley Fool Investment Guide -- from the beginning, pretty much, we've said, in fact, the very first day we launched on AOL, Aug. 4 of 1994, we said, ""We think you should be trying to beat the market. Otherwise, yeah, buy an index fund. And so follow along with us and watch us. We think we can beat the market.""
And I'm happy to say from that day forward we pretty much have been beating the market, and I don't think it's that hard a thing to do, really, in a world in which so many people are just trying to mail it in. They're just giving their funds over to somebody else who's managing them, often charging them 1% or 2% just to replicate the market's averages, but delivers that person, unfortunately, a sub-market return because of the fees of 1% or 2%. So if we can get around that, and do it ourselves -- and that's what you're talking about, Jordan -- then I say bully to us and it's worth going for. ANd I've certainly been well rewarded my life for investing in stocks directly.
So I do want to reassert that that is the goal, and so if you're a new listener to Rule Breaker Investing this week, if you've just found our podcast or The Motley Fool, I hope you know that most of us, we think, should be invested, to start with, in index funds, and just specifically, how about just the S&P 500 Index Fund, or Vanguard has one called the Total Market Index Fund. We like Vanguard because they are the Wal-Mart of the industry. They have the widest selection and the lowest prices, and really the fees that you pay for funds are what affect so much your returns over long periods of time.
So darn it, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Just go ahead and take the index fund and have fun with the rest of your life. But I think Rule Breaker investing, in particular, appeals -- not just the podcast, but the service -- to people who want to do better than average. And the benefits of doing better than average are very substantial, especially when measured over time.
If you and I can just exceed the S&P 500's return by 1% annualized, it might not sound like much after one year, but take out a calculator and do the math, and check out the difference between an 11% annualized return over 25 years versus a 10% annualized return. Now, I'm not doing it right now, because I'm doing Mailbag. I don't have my calculator in front of me, but it's not that hard to do with a calculator, and you'll see it's very substantial. Just a one-percentage-point difference. And I'm happy to say we've managed to achieve more than that in services like Motley Fool Stock Advisor. So I just want to reassert that's why we do what we do most of the time for many of our members who are looking for that, even if not everybody in life is looking for that.
And then the one other thread I wanted to speak to, before we move on, is just how do you judge yourself and score yourself? And for me, I still haven't found a better way than something as simple using anything from Quicken, where you can type in your stocks. At The Motley Fool we have a scorecard tool. You can use a spreadsheet. You can no doubt search the internet for a simple spreadsheet, a template that you could use, and just keep track of how you're doing with each stock.
When I buy a stock, I type in the ticker symbol. On the next cell over, I type in the price that I paid for it, and I usually include the commission there. Then on the next cell over, the next column of my spreadsheet, I'll just go ahead and indicate where the S&P 500 was that day, and then I have another couple of cells where I show the percentage gain in my stock, or loss. That happens, too, sometimes. And then the S&P 500, by comparison, and I net those out.
And then at the bottom -- and I hope this doesn't sound too hard; I don't do that much buying and selling, so it's not that hard for me -- but I would encourage you to track not just stock by stock, but the overall portfolio, of course. And if all that sounds like too much work, how about just note the amount of money that your brokerage account starts at on Jan. 1 of each year and then the amount that it closes at. And then do just tag it against the S&P 500. That's still, to me, the best way to judge your performance.
Of course, if you're investing in a more focused way, like you're just buying oil stocks or something, I guess you should be comparing yourself to an oil-sector fund, so make sure you're picking the right benchmark. But for most of us at The Motley Fool, the S&P 500 does just fine.

",Is There a Better Benchmark to Gauge My Returns Against Than the S&P; 500?

Medical-device makers have been among healthcare's top performers this year, and returns for individual healthcare stocks in the industry have been remarkable. Some of the best returns have come from Abiomed (NASDAQ:ABMD), Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW), and Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX). Shares in all three of these companies have outperformed the S&P 500 ETF by nearly 25% or more in 2016. Can their stock prices continue to soar? 
Pumping up profits
Abiomed's heart pumps are used to help support heart function following a heart attack or during surgery, and demand for these Abiomed's Impella catheters, sensors, and pumps has been steadily increasing as they win approval for use in more patients.
About 735,000 Americans suffer a heart attack every year, and since most heart attacks occur in older patients, and baby boomers are turning 65 at a pace of 10,000 per day, there's good reason to believe Abiomed sales will continue higher.
Last year, Abiomed won approval to use its devices in high-risk patients, and earlier this year, the FDA approved its use in patients experiencing cardiogenic shock; roughly 7.5% of heart attack patients suffer cardiogenic shock. Abiomed's penetration of this market is only around 5%. Despite the small penetration rate, this indication accounts for about 40% of Abiomed's Impella sales, so greater use stemming from the FDA go-ahead could send the company's profit significantly higher. 
In fact, that may already be happening. On July 28, the company reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $103 million, up 40.3% versus last year, with EPS of $0.29. Last year, the company delivered EPS of $0.20. That performance was solid enough for the company to up its fiscal full-year guidance. Management now expects sales to eclipse $435 million this year, rather than $430 million. Given the company's robust growth and improving guidance, it's little wonder shares are up 32.4% in 2016.

A new way to fix an ailing heart
Heart disease patients who are too frail to undergo open heart surgery are turning to transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, and that's boosting demand for Edwards Lifesciences' TAVR product line.
TAVR procedures allow doctors to insert a mechanical tissue valve inside of a patient's existing narrowed aortic valve in a way that's less invasive than traditional surgery. Because of the advantages associated with less-risky procedures in high-risk patients, growing adoption of TAVR resulted in Edwards Lifesciences reporting on July 27 that revenue grew 23.1% year over year to $759.3 million. TAVR heart valve product sales jumped 48.8% year over year to $418.6 million, and underlying U.S. growth was an impressive 66%.
Since sales growth was leveraged against fixed costs, the company announced a 30.9% increase in non-GAAP net income to $164.6 million, or $0.76 per share. The performance has management thinking it will deliver at the high end of its $2.7 billion to $3 billion sales guidance for this year. If so, investors will be rewarded with non-GAAP EPS of at least $2.78.
Hitting those targets could get easier if clinical trials continue to demonstrate that TAVR procedures can be useful in intermediate-risk patients, too. If doctors embrace TAVR for healthier patients, it could meaningfully expand Edwards Lifesciences' addressable market. That goes a long way toward explaining why shares have rallied 44.6% this year.

            });
        

Troubles move into the rear view mirror
Boston Scientific shareholders have suffered through FDA sanctions, lawsuits, and sluggish demand, but their patience is beginning to be rewarded as the company returns to growth. 
Shares have skyrocketed 32.5% in 2016.
In the first quarter, revenue grew 11.1% versus last year, and in the second quarter, sales growth accelerated to 15.4%. Second-quarter sales totaled $2.13 billion, and those results include a 12.7% increase in cardiovascular sales and a 29% increase in medical surgical sales. Sales of the company's defibrillators surged 52.8% higher in the period, and the company's non-GAAP EPS surged 22.7% higher to $0.27 in the quarter.
Back in April, management boosted full-year sales guidance to at least $8.07 billion, and after reporting its second-quarter numbers, management now forecasts that revenue will exceed $8.27 billion. Boston Scientific also bumped up its full-year EPS outlook to at least $1.07 from at least $1.06 exiting Q1 and at least $1.03 prior to Q1.
Despite Boston Scientific's share price increase, there's still reason to think there's room to run higher. Industry watchers think EPS could grow to $1.25 next year, and that means shares are trading at an arguably reasonable forward P/E ratio of 19. 
",These 3 Heart Disease Stocks Are Trouncing the S&P; 500 This Year
http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/24/investors-should-get-to-know-the-newest-stocks-in.aspx,2016-05-24,"

U.S. stocks are higher in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) (DJINDICES: $INDU) up 1.38% and 1.25%, respectively, at 12:05 p.m. EDT. Shares of vehicle parts distributor LKQ Corporation are outperforming its new benchmark, up 1.80%.
You never know where you'll find new stock ideas. I learned about LKQ Corporation from an S&P Dow Jones Indices press release announcing that the index provider was adding the stock to the benchmark S&P 500 index on May 20 (last Friday).
Formed in 1998 by Donald Flynn, LKQ is a distributor of vehicle replacement parts and components, including for specialty vehicles. The company has grown largely by numerous acquisitions. That is potentially a red flag for an investment, but this appears to be a classic ""roll-up"" strategy to achieve scale and a competitive advantage.
One of the most successful examples of a roll-up is the country's No. 1 trash hauler, Waste Management, Inc., which has risen to become the world's number one trash hauler. It's logical LKQ should be pursuing this strategy once you know that Flynn, who died in 2011, was instrumental in the growth of Waste Management, Inc., where he served as chief financial officer, senior vice president, and director.
Here are three things that raised my interest level after a cursory look at the company.
A founder with a track record of success
In 1987, Flynn and two of his former colleagues, including Waste Management co-founder Wayne Huizenga, bought a controlling interest in Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation for $18.6 million. In 1994, Viacom Inc. acquired Blockbuster in a stock swap that valued Blockbuster at $8.4 billion.
That record and legacy of value creation continued at LKQ, and the numbers are there to prove it: From the close of its first day of trading on Oct. 6, 2003, through yesterday, LKQ's stock has returned 18% on an annualized basis. That's more than 10 percentage points higher than the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 small-cap indexes over the same period.
A competitive advantage
Here's a general observation: Never invest in a company that does not mention ""competitive advantage"" anywhere in its annual report. Either it doesn't have one, or it isn't seeking to develop one (or perhaps, worst of all, management isn't familiar with or doesn't understand the concept).
LKQ is seeking to build a sustainable competitive advantage through technology -- it has the scale to invest in information systems that provide superior inventory management that enables better decision-making with regard to pricing, sales management, and purchasing. Paired with local warehouses for stocking inventory, that business data enables higher rates of customer fulfillment and satisfaction.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-16116');
            });
        

Ownership by successful, value-conscious investors
This is not a make-or-break condition, but when I see that smart, value-driven investors are among a company's shareholders, it suggests to me that perhaps I'm onto something. In the case of LKQ, among the top 20 shareholders, I recognize Wedgewood Partners, Akre Capital Management, and Alain Fournier's Pennant Capital Management.
At 18 times the current fiscal year's earnings-per-share estimate, I don't think the shares are mouth-wateringly cheap, but they don't look outrageously expensive, either (particularly relative to the broad market). I suggest investors take a look at LKQ -- there's reason to believe the company, and the stock, have the horsepower to keep motoring forward.

",Investors Should Get to Know the Newest Stock in the S&P; 500
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/20/sp-500-index-upgraded-3-things-you-need-to-know.aspx,2016-05-20,"

2016 isn't even half over, but already, analysts are starting to place their bets on 2017.
Case in point: On Thursday, Canaccord Genuity issued a new report in which it predicted that the S&P 500 Index (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) -- popularly represented as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:SPY) -- will hit 2,340 in 2017. The analyst's new estimate was set at an even 300 points above the index's valuation Thursday -- 2,040 -- and implies a gain of nearly 15% for stocks in general over the course of the next 19 or so months.
All of which is interesting in ""gee, isn't that interesting"" sense. But did Canaccord just draw that 2,340 number out of a hat? Where did the number come from, and what -- specifically -- is the analyst basing its prediction on?
Here are three things you need to know.
Thing No. 1: Canaccord is bullish on the future
Broadly speaking, Canaccord argues that ""a more stable global economy, emerging currency and commodity price backdrop should allow for better EPS growth despite the macro headwinds. We would focus new money in the more 'offensive' sectors."" The analyst predicts that operating earnings across the S&P 500 will grow about 7.4% in 2017, to $130 per ""share.""
Canaccord thinks it's appropriate to pay about 18 times operating earnings for that growth. 18 times $130 equals 2,340 -- and that's where the analyst's prediction comes from.

Image source: Wikimedia Commons.

As for the details that support that prediction, Canaccord says it is ""confident there is no recession on the horizon based on (1) the history of the Real Fed Funds Rate using core inflation, (2) the six-month/10-year yield curve, and (3) the Chicago Fed National Financial Condition sub-indices that measure financial market and banking stresses."" (Or translated into English, all the usual statistics that predict an impending recession are flashing green today, and there's no indication that a recession is imminent.)
Meanwhile, Canaccord is encouraged by ""74 months in a row of Payroll growth, Weekly Initial Unemployment Insurance Claims are at a multi-decade low, Household Debt Service Ratios and Consumer Delinquency rates are near record lows, and Consumer Confidence is near a cycle high.""
And if we were to translate that one for you, Canaccord is saying that not only does it see no red flags warning of recession, but in fact wage growth, jobs growth, and consumer confidence all suggest that consumers are ready and able to spend, and that should help keep the U.S. economy humming.
Thing No. 2: Canaccord is optimistic -- but not that bright
So that's good news, right? Well, not so fast. As it turns out, whatever Canaccord Genuity's insight into macroeconomics, the analyst hasn't proven to be all that bright about valuing stocks based on that insight. Fact is, according to our analysis of its record on Motley Fool CAPS, only about 38% of Canaccord's recommendations to buy or sell stocks actually outperform the S&P, and the analyst ranks in the bottom 20% of investors we track.
It's not hard to see why. In fact, you could guess that Canaccord is an analyst inclined to overpay for equities just from reviewing its math up above. Even assuming that the analyst is right about its predicted $130 in earnings next year, for the S&P 500 index to be worth 18 times those earnings, you'd usually want to see the stocks in question growing earnings at 18% or more.
In fact though, Canaccord's prediction is for just 7.4% growth -- half the level needed to justify a valuation of 18 times. In short, Canaccord appears to be recommending that investors overpay for growth.

Thing No. 3: So why listen to this analyst at all?
That's actually not uncommon among professional stock market analysts. Smart as these guys are, and as many degrees and credentials as they hold, our data on CAPS show that only 73 out of the 218 big-name investment bankers we track boast records of better than 50% accuracy when recommending individual stocks to buy.
That means barely one analyst in three has proven itself able to beat the market over time.
The most important thing: What it means to you
So what's the moral of this story? Tracking and crunching the numbers on big macroeconomic trends is a useful service that Canaccord provides -- just don't get too hung up on the analyst's predictions of specific price targets for the S&P 500, or for individual stocks, either. Given Canaccord's (and Wall Street in general's) record of over-optimism about how high stocks can fly, you're better off doing your own homework before actually buying or selling a given stock.
Examples? Over the past week, Canaccord has made two specific stock recommendations, initiating coverage of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at hold and upgrading shares of Nokia (NYSE:NOK) to buy. But honestly, their guesses are probably just as good as yours, or mine.
Microsoft, priced at 39 times earnings and expected to grow those earnings at only 8.5%, offers a good example of Canaccord being overoptimistic -- just as it is in regard to the S&P 500 index as a whole. 8.5% growth isn't anywhere near fast enough to justify paying 39 times earnings, and you don't have to be a professional stock market analyst to know that Microsoft is almost certainly overpriced. It's clearly not a buy, and probably doesn't deserve Canaccord's hold rating, either.
On the other hand, Nokia sells for less than 11 times earnings, is projected to grow at nearly 16%, and pays a 3.5% dividend yield, to boot. Nokia stock bears all the hallmarks of an excellent value play, and is a good example of a stock being cheap enough that even Wall Street can't fail to recognize it.
When you get right down to it, Wall Street may be right or wrong on the big economic trends, but valuation still matters most to successful stockpicking. And given Wall Street's record, you're probably at least as it is at spotting a good value.

",S&P; 500 Index Upgraded: 3 Things You Need to Know
http://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/how-to-calculate-abnormal-returns-with-stock-price.aspx,2016-05-12,"
""Abnormal returns"" is an important concept in academic finance, as well as in the investment management industry. Let's go over how to calculate an abnormal return for a stock using stock prices and S&P 500 data, complete with a concrete example.
First, what is an ""abnormal"" return?An abnormal return is the part of a stock's return that is be explained by a specific pricing model. In other words, a theoretical model meets market reality:

Abnormal return = expected return - actual return

""Expected return"" refers to the forecast return your pricing model spits out. Note that the abnormal return can be positive or negative.
The original model in this framework is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which enables investors to calculate a stock's expected return as a function of the risk-free rate, the market return (in practice, the return of a benchmark index), and beta, which captures how volatile the stock is relative to the market. However, there are other possible models, some of which are more sophisticated and use multiple factors.
For the purpose of our example, we will use the CAPM.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-9236');
            });
        


Another expression for abnormal return is ""excess return."" This is an intuitive label, as it refers to the return in excess of what is expected (although the abnormal return, again, can also be negative). The favored terminology of the investment management industry, however, is ""alpha."" Alpha is the Holy Grail of a fund manager who manages money actively.
Let's calculate the abnormal return for a high-profile stock, Netflix, for 2015, during which it was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, notching up a stunning 134.38% return.

NFLX 2014 return = ($114.38 / $48.80) - 1 = 134.38%

Step 1: Calculate your expected returnThis Wiki page covers this step in much more detail, but the basic formula for calculating a stock's expected return under the CAPM is:

Expected return = risk-free rate + beta x (market return - risk-free rate)

The risk-free rate we will use is the one-year Treasury bill rate as of Dec. 31, 2014, which was a miserable 0.22%. (These rates are available on the FRED website, which is maintained by the Federal Bank of St. Louis.) Netflix's beta is 0.97, according to data on Yahoo! Finance provided by S&P Capital IQ. The total return on the S&P 500, our market benchmark index, was 1.38% in 2015.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-46446');
            });
        


We have risk-free rate, beta, and market return -- all the inputs required to calculate our expected return:

Expected return (NFLX) = 0.22% + (-0.97) x (-1.38%) = 1.56%

Step 2: Compare the expected return to the actual return in order to determine the abnormal returnWe're now ready to calculate the abnormal return:

Abnormal return (NFLX) = actual return (NFLX) - expected return (NFLX) = 134.38% - 1.56% = 132.82%

In other words, the abnormal return of Netflix shares dwarfs the expected return generated by the CAPM; essentially all of the observed return is excess return (again, according to the CAPM model).
Perhaps that has something to do with the fact that Netflix shares ended 2014 down 29% from their 52-week high, whereas the S&P 500 had just put in its 52-week high two days earlier. Furthermore, the proportion of analyst ""Hold"" ratings (meaning the analyst is tepid on the stock) was the highest it had been in eight months. It's important to keep these unreliable factors in mind when forecasting or evaluating a stock's performance.

",How to Calculate Abnormal Returns With Stock Prices and S&P; 500 Data

The first-quarter earnings season kicks off today, and U.S. stocks are higher in late morning trading on Monday, with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) (DJINDICES: $INDU) up 0.15% and 0.25%, respectively, at 11:40 a.m. ET.
Those gains look inconsistent with the outlook for earnings: Based on the most recent data [launches Excel spreadsheet download] from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the S&P 500 continue to face an ""earnings recession"": First-quarter operating earnings are expected to fall by 0.2% year over year, which would mark the sixth consecutive quarterly decline.
The two sectors looking at the largest drops are Energy (down a third) and Financials (-19.1%). This week will provide some visibility with regard to the latter: Among the 15 S&P 500 companies that will report results are three of the Financials sector's largest components: JPMorgan Chase & Co. on Wednesday morning, followed by Wells Fargo & Co and Bank of America Corp on Thursday morning.
It's not worth fixating on the prolongation of the earnings recession: Given its magnitude of just 0.2%, it's quite likely the expected earnings decline will ultimately turn into a small increase once all of the numbers are in. The perennial dance that has companies under-promising in their guidance in order to beat the estimates of Wall Street analysts is still a crowd-pleaser.
(Not to mention that volatility in quarterly earnings bears little relationship to long-term stock market returns.)

Mutual funds: Find your flowLast week, this column observed that ""the flow of assets out of actively managed funds into index funds is turning into a tsunami that will ultimately require a wholesale reconstruction of the investment management industry.""
In its March issue of FundInvestor, fund research house Morningstar calls it ""Flowmageddon,"" and writes that, although ""the trend has more positives than negatives [for investors],"" it ""presents fund investors with a new challenge in monitoring and selecting investments. You've got to watch flows.""
That's a lesson that investors in Third Avenue Management's high-profile Focused Credit mutual fund learned the hard way last December, when the fund, which contained illiquid securities, collapsed in the wake of a rout in the high-yield market, forcing Third Avenue to halt investor withdrawals.
According to a fine in-depth article by The Wall Street Journal [link may require sign-up]:



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-9175');

[Then Third Avenue CEO] Mr. Barse became concerned about competition from low-cost index-tracking mutual funds, according to a former employee. Third Avenue attempted to launch ""alternative"" funds, or vehicles that resembled hedge funds, but most never clicked. One winner: the credit fund, which was launched in 2009 and quickly raced past $1 billion in assets.

Winner for whom? Vigilance and prudence are your watchwords.

The average stock on the S&P 500 pays a dividend yield of just under 2% as of May 2017, which is not exactly a thrilling payout for most income-seeking investors. However, there are some stocks on the index that have much higher dividends. Let's look at the 10 highest-paying stocks on the S&P 500 and see whether any of them are worth buying.

Table is author's own. Share prices and dividend yields current as of May 1, 2017.
You should be wary of some of these stocks
There are certainly some stocks on this list whose dividends are too good to be true. The top payer, telecom company CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL), is a prime example.
A stock's payout ratio tells us how much of the company's earnings are being paid out as dividends. Lower is better, and a payout ratio in excess of 100% implies that the company is paying out more than it makes, and therefore the dividend might be unsustainable.

Image source: Getty Images.

Well, CenturyLink pays dividends at a rate of $2.16 per year, but analysts are only calling for earnings of $2.16 in 2017 -- which means the company's payout ratio is forecast to be exactly 100%. What's more, earnings are expected to drop to $2.09 next year. This is a little too high for comfort.
Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) looks even worse from a dividend safety standpoint. The company pays out $1.52 annually, but earned just $1.06 per share in 2016, for a sky-high payout ratio of 143%. Mattel also reported disappointing first-quarter results, and I wouldn't be surprised to see a dividend cut in the not-too-distant future.
There are some good choices on this list
Before you get discouraged, I'll say that the majority of the dividend stocks on this list have pretty safe payouts. In fact, there are some that I'd call excellent long-term investments.
Specifically, I love the two real estate investment trusts (REITs) on the list, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) and Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM), and I actually own the former in my portfolio. By definition, REITs are supposed to pay out a high percentage of their earnings to maintain their tax benefits, so it's only natural that a couple of REITs made the top 10.
Iron Mountain is a leader in records storage and security, and you can read my thorough discussion of why I like the company as a long-term investment here. Kimco is a retail REIT that specializes in shopping center properties anchored by defensive retail tenants such as TJX Companies, Wal-Mart, and Dollar Tree, and it has a fantastic track record of delivering market-beating performance and strong dividend growth.
To name a couple more, Ford (NYSE:F) trades at an incredibly cheap valuation of just 7.4 times forward earnings, which are expected to cover the company's dividend more than 2.5 times over. Most analysts are expecting automaker earnings to fall significantly in the coming years, but Ford's low payout ratio should provide protection from a drop in profits. And Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are excellent income investments with consistent earnings and low volatility.

The Foolish bottom line
A high dividend all by itself isn't necessarily a good or bad thing. As we've seen, some of the stocks on this list don't even earn enough money to cover their dividend payments, while others earn more than enough to sustain their payouts and reward shareholders for years to come.
The bottom line is that any dividend is only as strong as the company paying it, so be sure to do a little digging before diving in to any of these high-dividend S&P 500 stocks.

",The 10 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks on the S&P; 500 in May -- Which Are the Best Buys?

Unsurprisingly, given the tragic events in Brussels today, global equity markets are lower on Tuesday. The U.S. is no exception, with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) (DJINDICES: $INDU) down 0.01% and 0.09%, respectively, at 11:30 a.m. ET. However, the impact of this terrorist attack on the U.S. stock market is likely to be minor and short-lived.
On a longer-term timeframe, one of the fundamental drivers of stock market returns is, of course, corporate earnings. On that front, the impressively widening gap between companies' adjusted earnings and conforming earnings is an unfavorable signal.
These are the hard numbers.
For the last 12 months, according to Evercore ISI (part of investment bank Evercore Partners), companies in the S&P 500 have reported adjusted earnings that are 30% higher than the earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Companies have a lot more discretion in calculating adjusted earnings, and these usually exclude ""exceptional"" items such as one-time charges.
That difference between adjusted and GAAP earnings is the widest it has been for any 12-month period since 2008, and the third-largest in ISI Evercore's time series, which starts in 1995.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-71335');
            });
        


It's not particularly encouraging that the two previous peaks, in 2008 and 2002, occurred during or just after a recession:

The Great Recession, which spanned December 2007 to June 2009.
The short recession that followed the bursting of the technology bubble (March 2001 to November 2001).

Furthermore, there is a cogent rationale to explain this link. As Pankaj Patel, Evercore ISI's head of quantitative research told the Financial Times, ""[the gap between adjusted and GAAP earnings] tends to rise when companies start making one-time exceptions and special items, and companies typically resort to these extreme measures when profitability starts taking a hit.""
The trouble, according to another quantitative analyst, Andrew Lapthorne of Societe Generale, is that GAAP earnings are a more realistic measure of corporate profits (he dubs pro forma profits ""made-up profits""); in the long run, then, they matter more.
It can be no coincidence that Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller opted to use GAAP earnings in calculating the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (the CAPE, or ""Shiller PE""), which is thought to be the best measure of long-term value.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-73462');
            });
        


It's worth noting that in each of the three periods in which the gap between adjusted and GAAP profits peaked, the widening was largely driven by the collapse in GAAP earnings in one specific sector: Technology in 2001/ 2002, Financials in 2008, and Energy in 2015.
Does the current ""earnings gap"" indicate that a recession is imminent? It's difficult to say, but it may be symptomatic of an aging bull market in which stock market gains -- certainly on the pace we've known since March 2009 -- will be hard to come by.

","This S&P; 500 ""Profits Gap"" Is a Warning to Stock Market Investors"
http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/05/05/its-happening-again-and-the-last-2-times-this-happ.aspx,2017-05-05,"
Over the long run, the direction of U.S. stocks is very clear: They head higher. Historically, when factoring in dividend reinvestment, investing in stocks returns about 7% annually. That's a good enough return to allow you to double your money once a decade, and more importantly, to handily outpace inflation so that you generate real-money returns.
But this doesn't mean hiccups don't occur from time to time. According to data aggregated by Yardeni Research, there have been 35 stock-market corrections of at least 10%, when rounded to the nearest whole number, in the broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) since Jan. 1, 1950. Some of these have been quite steep, including the dot-com bubble, which saw the S&P 500 lose half of its value, and the Great Recession, where the S&P 500 fell by as much as 57% from peak to trough.

Image source: Getty Images.

Is the S&P 500's quarterly buyback data a warning to investors?
Stock market corrections are inevitable, and they're nearly always unpredictable. However, there's an indicator that, in hindsight, has tipped off two major stock market corrections in the S&P 500 over the past decade: aggregate share buybacks.
According to FactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS), which puts out a veritable gold mine of S&P 500 company buyback data each quarter, quarterly share repurchases fell from nearly $180 billion in 2007 in the quarter prior to the start of the Great Recession to less than $140 billion in the next quarter. These buybacks tailed off almost every single quarter throughout the recession until S&P 500 companies were repurchasing less than $30 billion in aggregate common stock in 2009. During this period, the S&P 500 fell by 57%
Once again, in 2011, we witnessed aggregate share repurchase activity fall from nearly $130 billion for S&P 500 companies to less than $90 billion the very next quarter. The S&P 500 wound up dipping 19% from peak to trough soon after, albeit the move lower in the S&P 500 lagged the drop-off in corporate share buybacks in 2011.
I'll give you three guesses what we're beginning to see again based on the quarterly buyback data -- and the first two guesses don't count!
In the first quarter of 2016, aggregate share buybacks neared the $170 billion mark before falling almost $40 billion in the second quarter and down to $115.6 billion as of the Q3 data release from FactSet. On a year-over-year basis, this represents a 28% decline in share buybacks.

Image source: Getty Images.

It actually gets even scarier 
Why are S&P 500 companies paring back their share repurchases? It's certainly not for a lack of cash! A FactSet Insight report from March 2016 found that S&P 500 companies, excluding financials, had a near-record amount of cash on hand: $1.44 trillion. In fact, since the beginning of 2007, the amount of cash S&P 500 companies were holding, in aggregate, has doubled. In other words, there's a real possibility that S&P 500 companies pared back their repurchases because they either believe economic uncertainty is imminent, or they believe their stocks are no longer a good value.
But there are other reasons to be concerned.
A Yardeni Research report this past week found that operating earnings for the S&P 500 on a trailing 12-month basis in the fourth quarter were $919.9 billion. Yet, as of Q4 2016, trailing buybacks totaled $536.4 billion and aggregate dividends paid totaled $400 billion (as of Q1 2017). In short, S&P 500 companies are paying out more in aggregate buybacks and dividends combined (101.3%) than they're netting in operating earnings. The last time this happened was in 2007, right before the Great Recession.
The data shows that energy companies are partly to blame, with some funding their buybacks and dividends with debt in order to buoy their share prices. But the real concern here is that S&P 500 companies can't continue to fund massive buybacks and/or dividend increases based on what they're generating in aggregate operating earnings.
Combined, all of this data would certainly give credence to the idea that a double-digit percentage stock market correction in the S&P 500 is probably merited.

            });
        

Something to keep in mind 
However, it's important for investors not to overreact to this buyback data, no matter how much of a correlation there's been over the past decade between substantial drops in buybacks and stock market corrections.
The reason is very simple: Buying great stocks at regular intervals and holding them over the very long term is a winning strategy. The data doesn't lie. Despite 35 stock market corrections since the beginning of 1950, a bull market rally has eventually erased each and every correction, many times within weeks or months.
A separate report from J.P. Morgan Asset Management found that buying and holding the S&P 500 for a 20-year period between Jan. 3, 1995 and Dec. 31, 2014 would have netted investors a 555% aggregate return, or 9.9% per year. Remember, this includes the roughly 50% drop during the dot-com bubble and the 57% tumble during the Great Recession.
If investors tried timing the market and wound up missing its 10 best trading days, this aggregate return was more than halved. If you missed a little more than 30 of the best days over this 5,000-plus day period, your entire return would be wiped out.
Even if a stock market correction looks to be more probable than not, the data suggests that buying high-quality companies at regular intervals and averaging into great stocks over time is one of the smartest methods of building wealth over time.

","It's Happening Again -- and the Last 2 Times This Happened, the S&P; 500 Fell by 57% and 19%"
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/10/why-do-stocks-get-added-and-removed-from-the-sp-50.aspx,2016-02-10,"
The S&P 500 is a frequently updated market index of the 500 biggest large-cap, publicly traded American companies. Multiple companies are added to and removed from the S&P 500 every year. Companies like Peabody Energy, JCPenney, or Avon made headlines in recent years when they were delisted from the index.
In this video segment, Gaby Lapera and John Maxfield thoroughly explain the five qualifications that companies need to meet to stay in the index (and the underlying rationale behind them), when exceptions to the rules are allowed, and what it takes for companies to finally be taken off the list.
A transcript follows the video.


This podcast was recorded on Feb. 2, 2016. 
Gaby Lapera: The first question we got is from Rob Waters: Why are stocks delisted? Originally, that was ""Why are stocks delisted from the Dow?"" but we decided to do why are stocks delisted from the S&P, just because it's a better broad index than the Dow. So, in the last few years, I don't think that many stocks have been delisted, but the ones you may have heard of that you probably know would be like a JCPenney, or, I think, Avon was delisted in 2015.   There are five basic qualifications that the S&P has for stocks, that they need to fulfill, generally -- we'll get to some of the exceptions in a bit -- in order to stay within the index. The first is that the S&P is a large-cap index, and they generally want companies to be above $5.3 billion in order to stay on there.  John Maxfield: And that's $5.3 billion in market cap. And just to reiterate Gaby's point, you know that saying in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie? I can't remember which pirate it was, he was like, ""Oh, this is more guidelines, as opposed to hard and fast rules."" So, each of these things that we'll go through, each of these five components that we're going to talk about that she noted, all of these are just guidelines, as opposed to hard and fast rules.  Lapera: Absolutely. Generally, the exceptions come when the market is not doing great, and if they were to strictly adhere to all of the guidelines, there wouldn't be anyone in the S&P, and that would not be great for the S&P, right? So, there's a little bit of flexibility here. The second guideline -- the first, I'd like to remind you, is that it need to have a market cap of $5.3 billion or above -- the second is liquidity.   The stocks need to have traded at a minimum of 250,000 shares over a 6-month period leading up to the evaluation. I think the example we were talking about earlier, John, was Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), which is a great company. People know about it, it's really stable, but for the longest time, it was not in the S&P 500 because shares were so expensive that people couldn't afford to trade them easily.  Maxfield: Yeah. It's one of those really ironic things. When you think of our biggest and best large-cap companies in the United States, certainly Berkshire Hathaway is at the top of that, right? But the problem with that is, its shares, for all of these years -- well, not all these years, but for multiple years -- traded above $100,000 per share.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-65441');
            });
        


And it wasn't until 2010 when Berkshire purchased Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the railroad, that they did a stock split that then created a second category of shares that then trade for much, much less. And that's what has made it possible for individual investors to buy and sell it, which boosted its volume, which then qualified it for inclusion on the S&P 500.  Lapera: Another thing that all the companies on the S&P have in common is that they must be domiciled in the U.S. They define this in various ways. They have to file a 10-K, and then, they say you have to have a plurality of revenue and assets that are based in the U.S., or your headquarters must be in the U.S. Do you want to expand a little bit on why they have it that way?  Maxfield: This is a large-cap American index. So, what they mean by plurality is -- as a lawyer, this is something I'm relatively familiar with, because it comes into play in Supreme Court decisions -- but, what plurality means is, you don't have to have a majority, which would be at least 51%; but if you have, say, assets in five different countries, and, say, 40% of your assets are in the United States, and, whatever that would be, 15% or so in each of the other ones -- a plurality means the largest of the group. So, because it's a large-cap index that's based in the United States, they want, at least, of all the countries that you're exposed to, they want the largest share to be in the United States.  Lapera: Right. And this has something to do with avoiding tax laws and stuff like that, too. So, some people will register their companies in, say, Hong Kong or Ireland because taxes are less. And it gets complicated. But in general, that's what they want -- they want the companies to basically be based in the United States. The stocks, to stay in the S&P, have to be listed on the NASDAQ or the Dow. And, they must also have a corporate governance structure consistent with U.S. companies.  Maxfield: You fill in the blanks there.  Lapera: (laughs) Yeah, I have no idea what that means.  Maxfield: Does that mean, like, Enron? (laughs)  Lapera: (laughs) Oh, god.  Maxfield: Or does that mean Berkshire Hathaway? You know what I mean? It seems like the continuum there is probably pretty broad. But I think the point they're trying to make is that they want you to follow the same country guidelines, and they want you to abide by, at least, the same concept of how you should be operating ethically.  Lapera: Right. Just, like, a general, and something that's written down so people can look at it, as opposed to shadowy backdoor dealings. I think that's what they're trying to get at with that last one. So, so far, we've covered large-cap index, liquidity, domicile. The company must have a public float of at least 50% of their stock. Do you want to expound on that?  Maxfield: Yeah. When a company goes public -- Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is a good example. When it went public in, I think it was 1999, they don't list 100% of the company. They'll list, like ... I can't remember what it was with Goldman Sachs, but it was a pretty small percentage, maybe 5% or 10%, something like that. The rest of that, that 90%, whatever that remainder is, is non-floated stock, it's not traded on the active exchange.   Well, the S&P 500 wants companies that have at least 50% of that that's floated. Now, like, Goldman Sachs and their situation, that float has increased over time as their partners at the time of the IPO have sold out their positions and retired and diversified their assets and stuff like that. But, just, the idea is, you want these to be public companies that are highly liquid, and in order for those things to come into play, you need a large float.  Lapera: Right. And that ties a little bit into the last one, which is financial viability. This is probably the most common reason for stocks to get delisted, is that there's something fundamentally wrong with them. I think one of the latest stocks to be delisted was Peabody Energy, and you saw that their credit rating just got bumped and bumped and bumped again, all downward. So, they have to have positive earnings over the last four quarters, and they have to have good credit ratings. They just have to seem like a fundamentally sound business in general. Right?  Maxfield: Right. Exactly. Again, this is a general rule. You don't want the S&P 500 to be full of these companies that don't make any money, right? What would that say about an index that's supposed to track the large-cap sector of the United States, our biggest and best companies? But again, the way the S&P lays its methodologies out, it says, you have to have positive earnings over the last four quarters.
If you look back to the financial crisis, and you were a stickler on that, the S&P 500 would be the S&P 5. (laughs) You know? So you don't want to push it so far that it would defeat the whole purpose of the thing. But as a general rule, what they're getting at here is that they want good companies that adequately represent what America's biggest and best companies, for lack of a better term, represent.  Lapera: Right. And I'm going to say that, in general, I haven't ever seen the S&P delist a company and someone say, ""Oh, that was vindictive."" It's always like, ""Yeah, we kind of saw that coming."" You know what I mean?  Maxfield: Yeah. That's exactly right. JCPenney's, a few years ago, it's going down, going down, going down, and the S&P 500 were finally just like, ""Okay, fine, we have to get rid of these guys, it's getting pretty ugly here.""  Lapera: Oh, and, fun fact, when someone gets delisted, someone else can come on.  Maxfield: That's exactly right, because it has to stay at 500.  Lapera: Exactly. You can't have 501, that would be absurd (laughs).  Maxfield: I mean, you could, but you'd have to change the name.
",Why Do Stocks Get Added and Removed From the S&P; 500?

Investors have trillions of dollars in investments that track the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC), and the index is among the most popular benchmarks not only in terms of index-tracking investments but also in measuring investment performance in the stock market. Yet even though it's incredibly important for investors, the S&P 500 has some little-known aspects to it. Let's take a look at three facts that most people don't know about the S&P 500.
1. The primary S&P benchmark index didn't always have 500 stocks. Most long-term analysis of stock market returns traces the S&P index back to before the stock market crash of 1929. When it first started its index in 1923, Standard & Poor's tracked 233 different companies and calculated the index every week. That was inconveniently infrequent, so S&P later developed an alternative index with 90 different stocks that it could calculate on a daily basis.
The S&P 500 as we now know it, with 500 stocks, didn't come into being until 1957. The index was billed as including 500 leading U.S. companies, greatly expanding the scope of the other S&P indexes.
2. The S&P 500 has become much more diversified. When the 1957 version of the S&P 500 was created, Standard & Poor's included only three categories of stocks in the index. Industrial stocks held the lion's share of the spots, making up 425 of the 500 stocks. The index included 60 utility stocks and 15 railroad stocks, and all of the index constituents were listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In the mid-1970s, S&P loosened up its quota model slightly. The index's industrial contingent was reduced to 400 stocks, and only 40 utilities kept their spots. Twenty stocks in the transportation sector were part of the index, no longer limited to railroads, and 40 financial stocks rounded out the 500.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-81714');
            });
        


Nevertheless, in order to meet its goal of reflecting the make-up of the U.S. economy, S&P eventually had to take further action. In the late 1980s, given the rise of technology and energy stocks, the index manager finally chose to give up on the quota system entirely. Now, S&P chooses stocks with an eye toward having a representative sample across the stock market.
3. There are now strict requirements for getting into the S&P 500. S&P Dow Jones Indices manages the S&P 500 index, and it maintains eligibility criteria that stocks must meet before they can become part of the index. First, there's a market capitalization requirement, and to pass, a company has to have a $5.3 billion market cap or higher. Second, liquidity requirements include a minimum trading volume of 250,000 shares per month in each of the six months prior to a stock's evaluation for entry. Total dollar value of traded shares on an annual basis must exceed the float-adjusted market capitalization, and public float must be at least 50% of the total shares outstanding.
The S&P 500 is meant to include U.S. companies, but the definition of what constitutes such a company has changed over time. Now, the company recognizes that tax inversions and other corporate strategies can result in a company's headquarters being located overseas. But if most of the company's fixed assets are in the U.S. or if more of its revenue comes from U.S. sources than from other countries, then the index managers can include the company in the index. Finally, a company must be financially viable, with positive earnings over the preceding four quarters as well as the most recent quarter.
The S&P 500 is ubiquitous as a measurement of stock market success, but many people don't know its history. These little-known facts show some good insight into the origin of the S&P 500 and how it has evolved over time.

The S&P 500 equal-weight index counts all 500 component stocks equally. Photo: Flickr user Hans Splinter
The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) is regarded as one of the best indicators of the overall stock market's performance, but many investors don't realize that the components of the S&P 500 are weighted. This means that larger companies have more influence over the index's performance than smaller ones. If you don't want your portfolio to be too dependent on a few large companies, there's another form of the S&P 500 that considers all 500 stocks equally.
The S&P 500 equal-weight index When you turn on the news and see a quote for the S&P 500 (or most other indices), you're looking at a weighted index. In a weighted index, the largest companies make up a proportionally large portion of the index's holdings, and by definition, also make up a larger portion of the holdings of index funds that track them.
As the name implies, the traditional S&P 500 index is made up of 500 stocks. However, the weights of individual components vary dramatically. The largest company in the index, Apple, accounts for 3.67% of the index, and therefore is more influential over the performance of funds that track the index. On the other end of the spectrum, some of the smallest S&P 500 components, such as Fossil Group, account for less than 0.01% of the index's performance.
In other words, if Apple has a particularly good day, it could be enough to drive the S&P higher all by itself. Meanwhile, Fossil could literally triple overnight, and the index would barely budge.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-48553');
            });
        


In the S&P 500 equal-weight index, all 500 stocks account for the exact same percentage (0.2%) of the index immediately following a rebalancing. No single company has a disproportionately large or small influence on the index's performance.

As of November 29, 2015.
Why equal weight may be a good alternative  Proponents say that equal-weight index funds offer investors an inherent advantage over their weighted counterparts. Index Funds, a company that recently launched a new no-load S&P 500 equal-weight mutual fund to compete against some existing equal-weight investment choices, believes that the equal-weight index is the best-kept secret on Wall Street.
According to Michael G. Willis, Lead Portfolio Manager of Index Funds:



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-37071');
            });
        



I believe that the S&P 500 market cap methodology is systematically flawed because it forces investors to buy more of a stock as it increases in price and to sell stocks as they decrease in price. Said another way, investors are forced to ""buy high"" and ""sell low,"" which of course is the exact opposite of what they should be doing. That's a trading flaw that can be corrected by simply rebalancing the portfolio periodically to an equal weighting. This one simple change helps investors to sell the stocks which have risen in price and to buy the stocks that have fallen in price, reversing their trading process to a ""buy low and sell high"" strategy.""

In other words, if Apple's stock price soars during the coming quarter, traditional S&P 500 index funds will be forced to buy additional shares at the new, inflated prices in order to account for Apple's additional weighting. And if many of the index's energy components continue to fall, funds will be forced to unload shares at fire-sale prices -- the exact opposite of ""buy low, sell high.""
On the other hand, S&P 500 equal-weight funds would be forced to sell Apple shares at the higher price in order to bring their exposure back to even, and would also need to pick up more shares of the worst-performing companies.
Comparing the performance When comparing the performance history of both versions of the S&P 500 index, it's tough to argue against this claim of an advantage. The S&P 500 equal-weight index is relatively new (started in 2003), but the performance history of the two indices since then speaks for itself.

What this means is that a $10,000 investment in the equal-weight version would have grown to more than $31,000 since 2003, while the weighted index would have delivered a respectable, but less impressive $22,600 final value.

                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-72193');
            });
        


Risks The main risk involved with investing in an S&P 500 equal-weight fund is that you could miss out if the components with higher market caps perform especially well. For example, a good earnings report by Apple can be enough to boost the traditional S&P 500 all by itself, but the equal-weight index doesn't move much because of any one stock.
Of course, this isn't a real ""risk,"" because it works both ways. In other words, if Apple's share price were to plummet, equal-weight investors wouldn't get stung nearly as much as investors holding weighted S&P 500 funds.
If you want to invest in a broad basket of stocks via mutual funds and ETFs, but don't want too much of your money to be dependent on the performance of a few big companies, the S&P 500 equal-weight index may be a good alternative. There are several mutual funds and ETFs that track the equal-weight index, so if you're interested, do some research on the various companies offering them and the fees they charge in order to make the best decision for your investment objectives.

",The Other S&P; 500 Index Youve Never Heard Of
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/11/22/3-things-you-never-knew-about-sp-500.aspx,2015-11-22,"
The S&P 500 Index (SNPINDEX:^GSPC), created by Standard & Poor's in 1957, is one of the most widely followed stock indexes in the world, consisting of 500 of the largest companies listed on either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Generally, when people talk about the performance of the stock market, they're actually talking about the S&P 500 index, or one of the index funds that track it, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:SPY).
Despite how popular the S&P 500 index is among investors, there are still a few things about the venerable index that may surprise you. Three of our Foolish contributors are ready to fill you in.
Brian Feroldi: It's not just the largest 500 companiesIt's natural to assume that the S&P 500 would simply contain the largest 500 companies in the U.S. by market capitalization, but that's not the case. To be included in the index, a company first needs to meet a series of stringent financial and market metrics. 
For example, it needs to maintain a market capitalization of at least $5.3 billion, have at least 50% of its stock publicly available, and show four consecutive quarters of GAAP net income. Further, the annual dollar value at which it trades should be higher than its adjusted market capitalization, and it must have been listed on the public markets for at least six months. 
Sometimes these criteria can keep even huge companies out of the index for years on end. Berkshire Hathaway, for example, only joined the index in 2010, even though it was valued at about $158 billion at the time, making it largest public company in America excluded from the index. The company's class B shares had previously been priced at almost $3,500 apiece, and as a result they didn't trade enough to meet the S&P 500's volume standards. When shares were split 50-to-1, however, their price dropped to the double digits, and the S&P 500 welcomed Berkshire to the fold.

            });
        


I'm sure Warren Buffett smiled when the news broke that his company would finally be included in one of the world's most important indexes.
 
Tim Green: Dividends have turbocharged returnsThe S&P 500 index offers a vivid illustration of the benefits of long-term investing. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, $1 invested in the index (or rather the precursor to the index) in 1930 would have grown to $66.48 by the end of 2012 -- that's a 5.2% annualized return. That may not seem like much, but remember that this time period includes the Great Depression, the Great Recession, and all financial panics in between.

Furthermore, those returns exclude dividends, and it turns out that dividend income has a profound effect on long-term returns. From 1925 to 2012, about one-third of the average monthly total return of the S&P 500 index was due to dividend income. What does this mean in the long run? Well, $1 invested in the index in 1930, with dividends being reinvested along the way, would have grown to $1,832 by the end of 2012. That's a 9.6% annualized return -- a far more impressive result.

Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Dividends are a long-term investor's best friend, and over a period measured in decades, reinvesting those dividends greatly enhances returns. Simply looking at how the value of the S&P 500 index has changed over time doesn't convey the real potential of a simple strategy of buying, holding, and reinvesting dividends.

Steve Symington: Turnover is highThe S&P 500 is the most widely accepted proxy for large-cap U.S. stocks, so you might assume that turnover in the index's constituent stocks is relatively low. But you'd be wrong.
Just before the S&P 500's 50th anniversary in early 2007, Standard & Poor's revealed that only 86 original constituents of the 500-member index had stood the test of time. Between the mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, and economic gyrations that have occurred since then, another 21 of those original constituents have been removed and replaced in the index -- and that doesn't include General Motors, which was dropped following its bankruptcy in 2009 and then reinstated four years later.
In addition, overall turnover in the S&P 500 is accelerating. According to a 2012 study led by Innosight director Richard Foster, at that time an S&P 500 company was being replaced roughly once every two weeks -- which meant around 75% of the S&P 500 would be replaced over the next 15 years. What's more, based on nearly a century's worth of market data, the average tenure of a company on the S&P 500 fell to just 18 years in 2012, down from 25 years in 1980 and 61 years in 1958.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-39481');
            });
        


Foster noted that this acceleration is largely due to a combination of stronger growth and the increasing rate of disruptive technological innovation in recent years. In the end, while that arguably makes it harder than ever for investors to identify stocks of enduring businesses to buy and hold for the long term, it certainly won't stop us from trying.

This SPDR ETF can instantly have you invested in about 80% of the U.S. stock market. Photo: TaxCredits.net.
With more than 3,000 different stocks and roughly 8,000 mutual funds to invest in, it's not easy to decide where to put your money. To make matters worse, many people lack the time, interest, or expertise to pick individual stocks or actively managed mutual funds. Fortunately, there's an excellent alternative: buy the bulk of the American stock market all at once through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the benchmark S&P 500 index.
I'm speaking of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:SPY), which is also sometimes referred to by its nickname, ""Spider."" ETFs trade like stocks throughout the day but are structured more like mutual funds, containing a variety of holdings. In the case of the SPDR ETF, its holdings are the 500 companies that make up the S&P 500, one of the key benchmarks for our entire stock market. Indeed, the S&P 500 companies together make up about 80% of the overall U.S. stock market's value.

Nuts and boltsETFs have expense ratios (annual fees) just like mutual funds do -- only they tend to be much lower. For example, the respected Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:VFINX), a mutual fund that's also based on the S&P 500, sports a low expense ratio of 0.17%. Meanwhile, managed mutual funds often charge 1% or more -- and sometimes a lot more. But the SPDR S&P 500 ETF charges a truly tiny expense ratio of 0.0945% -- 44% less than the low-cost Vanguard mutual fund.
To put that in perspective, if you plunk $10,000 into the mutual fund, you'll pay about $17 per year in fees. With the SPDR ETF, though, you'd pay $9.45.
Meanwhile, because the S&P 500 seldom changes its roster, the Spider is not constantly jumping in and out of stocks and thereby racking up commission costs. It has a low turnover ratio of just 4% versus 23% for its category, per Morningstar.

Holdings and performanceSo what are the index's biggest holdings? Well, the S&P 500 is market-capitalization-weighted, meaning that the companies with the largest market value will wield more influence in the index. Here are the top holdings, as of Oct. 6:

The table shows that a move in the value of Apple will have roughly three times the effect on the index as a similar-sized move by Facebook. Remember, too, that the index has about 500 companies, and since the top 10 companies alone make up about 17% of its value, hundreds of other companies clearly have rather small weightings.
The performance you'll get from this SPDR ETF will basically track the performance of the S&P 500, less a little to account for fees and trading costs. Here are some stats from Morningstar:

SPDR ETF strategiesSo what should you do with all this information? Should you invest in this SPDR ETF? Well, if you want to invest in an S&P 500-based index fund, then this is an excellent and extremely inexpensive way to do so. And it makes a lot of sense.

You might split your portfolio, investing a portion of your long-term assets in individual stocks and/or managed mutual funds and parking the remainder in this ETF. You might also decide that you don't have the wherewithal to choose individual securities and simply park all your long-term assets in the ETF. Even Warren Buffett has suggested that this is a fine idea for most of us. After all, index funds tend to outperform managed funds over long periods of time.
AlternativesFinally, remember that this ETF isn't the only index-fund ETF around. Other solid choices include the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEMKT:VTI) and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (NYSEMKT:VT). Respectively, they distribute your assets across the entire U.S. market and nearly all of the world's stock markets.
Great wealth can be made by simply leaving money in inexpensive broad-market index funds for decades.

Two utility stocks were near the top of the S&P 500 list last quarter. Image: katsrcool, Flickr.
The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) finally suffered a long-awaited correction during the third quarter, as investors worried about whether the U.S. economic recovery would be able to survive an end to the most favorable monetary policy available from the Federal Reserve. Even though nearly three-quarters of S&P 500 stocks posted declines between July and September, there were still plenty of winners in the market, and a few managed to post gains of more than 30% for the quarter. Let's take a closer look at these winners to see what was behind their successful season.
3. AGL Resources, up 33%  Merger and acquisition activity is often a key driver for stocks that soar, and that was a common theme for the stock market's winners this quarter. For gas utility company AGL Resources (NYSE:GAS), the good news came in late August when the company said that utility giant Southern Company (NYSE:SO) would buy AGL for $66 per share. The combination will bring together a wide network of electrical and natural-gas utility services across nine states, with an estimated 9 million customers covered under the combined company's umbrella.
Going forward, Southern Company shareholders will be the ones to benefit from AGL's future success, with the all-cash deal giving existing AGL investors no direct ability to share in further gains. But with utilities having been under some pressure from the threat of rising interest rates, AGL shareholders might end up feeling like they got out at just the right time.
2. Cablevision Systems, up 36% Another area that has seen considerable consolidation has been the cable television industry, and the latest company to show up on the chopping block was Cablevision Systems (NYSE:CVC). The company agreed to a deal with European telecom company Altice under which Cablevision shareholders will receive $34.90 per share in cash. Due in large part to the influence of the Dolan family, which owns a huge block of Cablevision shares, the deal has already passed the threshold in terms of needing no further approval from other Cablevision shareholders.
For Altice, the move is just the latest in a series of aggressive acquisitions throughout the world, and those following the stock expect that the company will seek to use cost-cutting measures to boost profits at Cablevision. Altice founder Patrick Drahi has said that he expects the U.S. market to provide as much as half of the company's overall global revenue, and if approved, the Cablevision deal will fit well with that goal. Again, though, existing Cablevision shareholders have no direct ability to share in Altice's possible success because of the all-cash nature of the deal.

1. TECO Energy, up 50%  Finally, TECO Energy (NYSE:TE) was the big winner in the S&P 500 for the quarter, jumping 50% in two waves. The first came in July when the company said it would put itself up for sale. Then, in September, the company announced a final deal from Canadian utility Emera that will pay TECO shareholders $27.55 per share in cash.
TECO has an unusual mix of businesses under its corporate umbrella, with two widely spaced geographical areas it serves. Serving electric and natural gas customers in Florida is arguably its primary business, but the company also has more than half a million customers in New Mexico to whom it distributes natural gas. For Emera, which serves eastern Canada as well as the state of Maine and the island of Barbados, adding some more exposure to different geographical areas seems to fit well with its overall business strategy.
M&A activity can give investors a quick payday, but it can still be bittersweet for those who continue to believe in the long-term prospects of the businesses that are being acquired. Nevertheless, investors in these three stocks have the option of taking their cash and buying shares of the acquiring companies on the open market. If you continue to believe in their eventual success, then doing so can be a way to build on your gains from their mergers.

",The 3 Top-Performing S&P; 500 Stocks From a Tough Summer

To say that the stock market has been a bit volatile over the past month might be a bit of an understatement. As investors, we haven't witnessed a true correction in stocks in nearly four years. Although corrections give long-term investors the opportunity to pick up high-quality companies at a discount, it also has a tendency to shake nerves as stock values deflate.
One of the smartest moves you can make before, during, and after a market correction is to load your portfolio with high-quality dividend-paying companies. Not only have companies that pay a dividend historically outperformed publicly listed companies that don't pay a dividend, but they offer other advantages as well.
To begin with, the willingness of a company to pay a regular dividend signifies the health of its business model and portends that it likely has a positive long-term growth outlook. In short, why would a company share its profits with investors, or increase its dividend over time, if it didn't foresee growth on the horizon?
Secondly, a dividend payment can help offset (at least nominally) the downward momentum in your portfolio. Dividend payments alone aren't going to stop you from recognizing potential paper losses during a correction, but over time they can really soften the effect of any correction.
Finally, dividends afford investors the opportunity to reinvest their payment into more shares of stock, thus compounding your potential for gains (and dividends) over time.

This trillion-dollar portfolio is yielding more than 4% As a whole, the S&P 500 is yielding close to 2%. Without reinvestment, investors are looking at doubling their money every 35 years based solely on its current yield. However, pack your portfolio with a select group of mega-cap, high-quality stocks out of the S&P 500 and you'll be left with a trillion-dollar portfolio of companies that has an average dividend yield of 4.2% -- double the yield of the S&P 500!
Let's have a brief look at four diverse mega caps (which combine for a market valuation of $1 trillion) that can help you achieve a 4.2% yield.
Source: ExxonMobil.
ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) One thing you have to keep in mind with the yield of a dividend is that it's a reflection of a company's stipend versus its stock price. Although oil and gas giant ExxonMobil has fared extremely well compared to many of its peers, the primary reason its yield has lifted to 4% is the decline in its stock price tied to weakness in oil prices. It's not out of the question that persistently lower oil prices in the coming years could negatively affect its profitability and weigh on its share price even more.
However, looking at the big picture ExxonMobil is still sitting pretty. As my Foolish colleague, and ExxonMobil shareholder, Tyler Crowe pointed out in July, ExxonMobil is tops among integrated oil and gas giants when it comes to return on equity over the trailing-12-month period, and it still views the U.S. shale outlook as positive. When you're buying ExxonMobil, you're making a bet that the future demand of global energy is going to increase, which in my opinion is a likely scenario.

            });
        


While hiccups could be present until the oil markets find stability, ExxonMobil's ability to pull levers to cut its costs and its diverse asset base make it an attractively priced company with an above-average yield.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Turning to the healthcare sector, Johnson & Johnson sports a valuation of roughly a quarter-trillion dollars and a 3.2% dividend yield that's increased in each of the past 53 years.
Johnson & Johnson offers a number of advantages that could make it an attractive investment. For starters, its products are generally inelastic. It sells healthcare products, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals that will continue to sell regardless of whether the U.S. economy is booming or in a recession. Consumers can't decide when they want to be sick, which gives drug developers and health consumer product providers like J&J the upper hand on pricing.
More importantly, Johnson & Johnson's drug development subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, is among the most impressive and successful in the world. Between 2009 and 2014, J&J brought 14 novel drugs to market, with half of those drugs achieving blockbuster status (i.e., more than $1 billion in annual sales). Looking ahead, J&J believes it can file for approval of 10 new blockbuster drugs before the end of the decade.

            });
        


Long story short, Johnson & Johnson and its AAA-rated credit seem like a good bet for long-term success.
Source: General Electric.
General Electric (NYSE:GE) Conglomerate General Electric may have toyed with investors' emotions during the Great Recession, but its financial arm woes are now largely in the rearview mirror, with the company planning a complete exit. Instead, GE's reliance on the energy, transportation, and health industries could be a boon that spurs growth for decades to come.
In recent years, General Electric has made a push to return to its roots, which is its industrial heritage. The focus is on maintaining 70% of operating revenue from the industrial sector, which will place a focus on power and water, as well as aviation -- both saw a surge of 29% and 37%, respectively, in the second quarter. Furthermore, GE's backlog improved to $272 billion in Q2 2015, an 8% increase from the year-ago period.
General Electric stands poised to benefit from a push to cleaner energy-generation devices (e.g., turbines), more fuel-efficient locomotives, and even from the Affordable Care Act, which could cause demand for its medical equipment to rise. With mid- to high-single-digit organic growth expected in the near term, General Electric's 3.7% dividend yield is certainly looking appealing.
Source: AT&T.
AT&T (NYSE:T) Lastly, content giant AT&T, one of the highest-yielding dividend stocks in the S&P 500, is what can help push your trillion-dollar portfolio over the 4% yield hump with its current 5.8% dividend yield.
Put plainly, AT&T's business is fairly boring and predictable, but that's great news if you're an income-seeking investor. AT&T has the most loyal wireless customer base according to a survey conducted by Brand Keys, and it's backed up by the company's very low wireless postpaid churn rate of just 1.01% in the second quarter.  
What makes AT&T such a force in the content space is that there are so few options available for consumers to choose from in terms of cable, Internet, and voice providers. With the knowledge that most consumers have just one to three options, AT&T doesn't have to play hardball with its pricing, lending it the opportunity to pad its margins as needed.
More importantly, the acquisition of DIRECTV is going to allow AT&T to offer a uniquely bundled content package that simplifies things for its consumers and makes receiving content potentially more convenient.
Considering its historically low volatility and steady profitability, AT&T is a company for risk-averse, income-seeking investors to seriously consider.

",This Trillion-Dollar Portfolio Offers Double the Dividend Yield of the S&P; 500
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/09/16/the-6-best-sp-500-stocks-of-the-past-decade.aspx,2015-09-16,"

These 6 stocks are soaring. Photo: Stockpic.com. 
The S&P 500 market index has gained 61% over the last 10 years, averaging an annual return of 4.9%.
That's a sluggish growth curve, but still a better investment than any savings account started in the last decade. But that benchmark covers the stock market in general. Did you know that five different S&P 500 members have delivered gains of 2,000% or more over the same period?
It's true. Though it wasn't always a smooth ride, six S&P 500 stocks would have multiplied a mid-2005 investment at least 20-fold. Here's how.
Conspicuous in their absence  A few seemingly obvious names didn't show up in this rundown. For example, a certain fruit-flavored computer and smartphone designer holds the largest market cap in the world, but fell just short of this list. That stock grabbed the #8 spot with a 1,540% gain. You can't win 'em all, and it's difficult to deliver massive percentage gains starting from a very large original market cap.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-49163');
            });
        


That being said, let's move on to the actual countdown.
#6: The single-serve coffee empire  Sliding in with an exact 2,000% gain over the last decade, Keurig Green Mountain (NASDAQ:GMCR) built a single-serve coffee kingdom through acquisition and careful management. As of last summer, Keurig could look back at a titanic 8,650% 10-year gain. The world was awash in Keurig-branded coffee brewing solutions, and everyone else could only hope to sell a few bean pods to Keurig's users, all under heavy license fees.
Tight-fisted control over these single-serve systems and their supplies created this empire in the first place, but also led to huge setbacks in 2014 and 2015. The company introduced a brewing system with built-in digital signatures, meant to stop unlicensed bean roasters from entering this lucrative field without paying those big Keurig royalties.
Strained coffee industry partnerships started falling apart, and consumers hated the very idea of artificially enforced limits on their bean choices. Keurig had to back down from this unpopular approach, and K-Cup 2.0 will now accept a wide variety of coffee pod brands without strict license checks.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-73335');
            });
        


The whole K-Cup 2.0 saga was a terrible mistake, but far from fatal. Again, Keurig investors have enjoyed a 2,000% return in ten years. That's nothing to sneeze at.


#5: The former king  Energy drink specialist Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) is next, yielding a 2,170% return over 10 years. Those caffeine-packed sodas sure hit a nerve, and Monster is still racing. The stock has doubled over the last year alone, lifted by strong earnings reports and a very tight partnership with the world's largest beverage distributor.
For the historians and true long-term investors among us, that's actually a bit of a letdown. Looking back ten years from 2005, the company then known as Hansen Natural was the best performer of the decade. The 10-year return back then? A staggering 24,185%.
The stock has now ranked at or near the top of the market's fastest growers for two solid decades. Among the other 2005 superstars, two companies have been acquired, two kept pace with the S&P 500, roughly doubling in ten years, and four stocks declined in value, with drops ranging from 10% to 91%.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-26308');
            });
        


But Monster kept the good times rolling for twenty years. That's a big ""Wow!"" in my book.
#4: The hyper-specialized drug designer  Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN) comes next, rising 2,190%.
The company has made a mint on treating diseases too rare to get widespread attention from the usual biotech suspects. In particular, Alexion is known for Soliris, an antibody designed to treat two unusual diseases of the blood.
At more than $400,000 per year, Soliris is arguably the most expensive medicine on the market. Some health insurance providers cover the drug; others don't. Either way, Alexion pockets the massive revenue from each patient under Soliris treatment. Alexion can charge that much because Soliris is the only treatment option on the market.
Again, we're talking about extremely rare diseases, offering little incentive for other drug makers to enter the market. Research is expensive, after all. No, a second provider wouldn't be able to match Alexion's $400,000 annual bill, because a healthy market with several options will naturally lead to lower prices.
So Alexion finds these rare niches, takes the risk of developing or acquiring appropriate treatments, and then reaps huge rewards when the bet works out. This oddball strategy has unlocked a ton of value for Alexion investors over the years.

Source: Netflix.

#3: The digital video wizard  Ten years ago, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was a fresh-faced DVD rental service. Competing chiefly with Blockbuster and mom'n'pop video stores, Netflix mailed red envelopes to 4 million subscribers while learning the ropes of doing business in Hollywood.
The company quietly added an all-digital viewing option, included for free with your DVD-mailer service. In 2011, the two services were split apart. Now, the old DVD business is a helpful but increasingly irrelevant oddity. Netflix is all about digital video streams nowadays.
The company serves more than 62 million streaming customers now, including 21 million outside American borders. While there's still some room for growth in the domestic segment, the bigger story is Netflix aiming to cover the entire globe in streaming services by the end of 2016. The company makes its own award-winning shows, is getting into the movie production business on the side, and hopes to capture loyal audiences worldwide with its unique portfolio of high-quality content.
That led to a 2,860% 10-year stock return, a period that includes the Qwikster blunder. That separation between Netflix's DVD and streaming services in 2011 was poorly handled, sending investors running for the exits. Four months later, the stock had lost a heart-stopping 78% of its market value.
But management had already seen the error of its ways, corrected the obvious mistakes, and set the company up for long-term success.
""Selling Netflix today would be a big mistake,"" I said near the bottom of the 2011 trough. ""Huge. This is actually where you back up the truck.""
A week later, I added shares to my Netflix position at a split-adjusted $11.86 each. Today, Netflix shares trade for $99.16. You do the math.
So the stock has bounced back from a seemingly fatal mistake, and still has a ton of growth ahead. Come back in 2025, and you might very well find that Netflix pulled a Monster-style run of two decades in the hypergrowth spotlight.
#2: The affordable travel titan  Priceline.com (NASDAQ:PCLN) reached a 6,340% return through a combination of efficient operations and smart marketing.
The service is known for low-cost airline tickets and hotel reservations, mostly sold under the ""name your own price"" banner. Priceline markets this package to consumers with the help of William Shatner, the quirky actor formerly known as Star Trek 's Captain Kirk.
The company may be a massive success today, but still only serves about 2% of the $2.4 trillion annual market for global travel sales. Priceline has grown its free cash flows right in line with those massive share price gains, and is putting that cash to good use via strategic acquisitions and projects stretching into new markets.
This is not the last time you'll hear about Priceline in light of its raging growth prospects.
And with that, we've reached the end of the line. Drumroll, please...

Eylea's big FDA moment deserved an announcement in Times Square. Source: Regeneron.

#1: The mainstream drug giant  If Alexion took the backstreets to massive stock gains, then Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) walked down Main Street in broad daylight.
Regeneron's defining hit is macular degeneration treatment Eylea. Wet macular degeneration affects about 40 million people globally. Ten years ago, the disease almost always led to blindness. Now, Eylea is one of three effective treatments for the condition.
So this is not a boutique opportunity, but a mass-market condition. Eylea is also used to suppress tumor cells in colorectal cancer patients under the Zaltrap brand. That's another 1.4 million global cases per year, and Regeneron could still find other cancer forms that respond to Eylea/Zaltrap's reduction of new blood vessel growth.
In short, Regeneron built its soaring 6,870% returns on developing medical treatments for very common diseases. The market obviously has a place for both Alexion's laser-focus and Regeneron's broad approach.
Looking back at this list, we didn't find any investment banks or Silicon Valley high-tech companies. Instead, these six 2,000% gainers included two drug developers and four beautifully simple consumer goods stocks. Keurig and Priceline prove that exciting growth can be found in downright boring markets like coffee beans and discount airline tickets. And the winners in 2025 will mostly be today's unknown, underappreciated, under-the-radar minnows.

Today's ADP employment report, which prefigures Friday's report from the Labor Department, was a disappointment: The gain in private payrolls of 185,000 came in lower than the low end of the consensus range (the consensus forecast was 210,000). Despite this (or perhaps because of it -- the result favors the Fed pushing back its first rate rise), stocks are in the black on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the broader S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) up 0.06% and 0.44%, respectively, at 1 p.m. EDT. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.90%.

Why do financial journalists let strategists make wild assertions about the stock market unchallenged? Veteran strategist Laszlo Birinyi appeared on CNBC yesterday, defending a report his eponymous company just published, according to which the S&P 500 could hit 3,200 in 2017. Here's what he said: 



Most people don't realize that we are now in the second greatest S&P [500] rally in history and we're actually ahead of the 1990 rally. If the market continues to gain eleven basis points a day as it has for the last six years, two years out or so, we're going to be over 3,000 [...] There's no reason why we can't go back to as much 1990, there's no reason why we can't keep on going.



No reason? What about the objection that the stock market is now somewhat overvalued (or fully valued, at the very least)? Here's how Mr. Birinyi tries to dispatch that rejoinder:          



""The easy money's been made, the market is now overvalued"" -- we've heard this for six years [...] It's an interesting thing about [price-to-earnings] multiples: If you go back and you look again, the way I do, that was a big concern going into the 1990 rally. The P/E on the S&P [500] in January 1991 was 18 times [earnings per share].




[Note: On the same basis (using thetrailing-12-months' operating earnings per share), the S&P 500's price-to-earnings multiple is currently 17 times.] 



Contrary to Mr. Birinyi's assertion, there are excellent reasons the market is unlikely to keep rising over the next five years (or two years) at the same rate it has during the bull run of the 1990s (or at the rate since the current bull market began, in March 2009.) Here are two of them.


During the five-year period from 1991 through 1996, companies in the S&P 500 grew operating earnings per share at an annualized rate of 16.1% (and GAAP earnings per share at 19.4%). That figure, which is well above historical growth rates, was achieved following a decade in which earnings had inched forward at the anemic rate of 0.4%. In Jan. 1991, earnings were poised to rebound sharply, like a coiled spring -- the short recession of 1990-1991 would come to an end just two months later. 


Conversely, over the past 10 years, despite the Great Recession, earnings have increased at a pretty respectable clip -- 4.4% annualized (+8.6% over the past five years). As such, it's unlikely that earnings growth over the next five years will come anywhere the performance it enjoyed in the early 1990s. 


Furthermore, between Jan. 1991 and Jan. 1996, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell from 8% to 5.6%, providing a tailwind for stocks. (When the risk-free rate declines, all other things equal, it lowers the rate investors use to discount future cash flows, thus raising intrinsic value estimates.) With the Fed likely to raise its policy interest rate for the first time before the year is out, stocks won't benefit from the same headwind over the next five years -- quite the contrary, in fact. 


Keep calm and temper your expectationsI do agree with Mr. Birinyi when he says: 



It's more a matter of guidance. What we're really trying to tell people is stay with it. Don't let the bad news shake you out. We've heard all the bad news before.


By all means, don't let the merchants of doom shake you out of the market -- you ought to be investing in stocks incrementally with a time horizon that extends beyond the next market cycle. However, one needs to be realistic, too -- anyone who believes the next two years will look like the past six needs to significantly temper their expectations.

",Stocks: Can the S&P; 500 Gain 50% By 2017?
http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/02/15/15-big-changes-since-the-sp-500-market-cap-doubled.aspx,2017-02-15,"
Milestones seem to be falling at a breakneck pace over the past couple of years. On Monday, Feb. 13, the broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) closed at an all-time record high, and in the process, the aggregate value of S&P 500 companies crossed the $20 trillion threshold for the first time ever. For Wall Street, the milestone represents affirmation that the bull-market rally is here to stay.
However, it took quite some time for the S&P 500 to double based on market cap from $10 trillion to $20 trillion  19 years -- given the dot-com bubble in 2000-2001, as well as the Great Recession. Here are just some of the things that've changed over those 19 years.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock: In 1998, the technology giant was still nearly a decade from introducing the world to the iPhone, and it controlled about 0.06% of the S&P 500's weighting. Today, at a better than $700 billion market cap, Apple and its army of loyal customers is responsible for about 3.5% of the S&P 500's weighting.
Gallon of gas: A gallon of gas would set you back $1.07 by the end of January 1998, whereas today the average gallon of gas costs $2.31.

Price per ounce of gold: At the end of January 1998, you could pick up an ounce of gold for $302.02. Today, that same ounce of gold will cost you about $1,228.30.
Price per ounce of silver: Toward the end of January 1998, an ounce of silver could be purchased for just $6.22. As of today, that same silver ounce is worth $17.94.
Movie ticket price: Heading to the movies in 1998 would have cost an average of $4.69 on an inflation-adjusted basis, compared with an estimated $8.65 per ticket today.
Median home price: If you were purchasing a home in January 1998, you were dealing with a median home price of $148,000, according to the Census Bureau. As of the third quarter of 2016, the median home prices in the U.S. was up to $247,000.
Unemployment rate: The unemployment picture is very similar, with the unemployment rate in January 1998 (4.6%) coming in just below that of January 2017 (4.8%). 


Image source: Disneyland.

Disney World ticket price: Heading to Disney (NYSE:DIS) World in Florida in 1998 would have cost $39.75 per adult, or $288 for an annual pass. Today, a regular ticket runs $115, with an annual pass setting a consumer back $779. Mind you, Disney just increased its theme-park ticket prices this week.
Wilshire 5000: The Wilshire 5000 market-cap-weighted index contained more than 7,500 companies as of July 1998, as private companies rushed to meet investor demand and go public. By Dec. 31, 2016, there were only 3,618 publicly traded companies in the Wilshire 5000.
30-year fixed mortgage rate: At the beginning of January 1998, homebuyers would have been dealing with an average 30-year mortgage rate of 6.99%. Today, the 30-year rate is a more appealing 4.27%, per Bankrate.
One dozen eggs: Back in 1998, heading to the store for a dozen eggs would set you back $1.09. As of December 2016, the price for a dozen eggs had only risen to $1.38 (although that's down 50% from December 2015).

Bacon price per pound: Back in 1998, a pound of sizzling bacon would set a consumer back $2.96. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a pound of sliced bacon was selling for $5.10 in December 2016. 
National debt: All the way back in 1998, the federal debt totaled ""just"" shy of $5.8 trillion. Within a matter of weeks, we're liable to cross the $20 trillion federal debt threshold.
Median household income: In 1998, median household income was $51,295, when adjusted for inflation. By 2015, the latest data available from Census data, median household income had risen to $55,775. 
U.S. postage stamp: A U.S. postage stamp increased to $0.33 in 1998, which compares with the $0.47 consumers pay for postage stamps today.

Prices change, but one aspect remains quite steady
A lot has changed over the past 19 years as the S&P 500's market cap has doubled in value. Yet despite these big changes, one factor remains firmly in place: Over time, the valuation of the stock market, and of high-quality companies, tends to increase.

Image source: Getty Images.

On average, the stock market returns about 7% per year, with dividend reinvestment factored in. This would put the stock market on track to double in value about once every decade. Understand, this is just an average, and as we saw between 1998 and 2017, it took a bit longer. Then again, culling data can be arbitrary. For example, the S&P 500 has risen more than threefold since its lows in 2009. If you had regularly been buying stocks without paying any attention to where the S&P 500 was, you'd likely have purchased companies that have increased multiple times in value since 2009.
According to data from Yardeni Research, the S&P 500 has undergone 35 stock market corrections of at least 10% since 1950, when rounded to the nearest whole number. In every single instance, the stock-market correction was wiped out by a bull-market rally. Sometimes it took weeks, months, and in rarer cases a few years, but when all was said and done, patient long-term investors were rewarded with a higher-marching stock market.

            });
        


What's more, a study released by J.P. Morgan Asset Management found that holding the S&P 500 between January 1988 and November 2015 would have led to an average annualized return of 10.8%. However, missing just its 40 best days over this 27-year, roughly 7,000-day period would have reduced your average annual return to 2.9%!
The data doesn't lie. Holding high-quality companies over the long run, and buying companies at regular intervals, regardless of where the S&P 500 or other indexes are valued, is a winning strategy.

Q: What's the difference between the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Dow, is perhaps the most well-known stock index in the world, and milestones achieved by the index, such as the recent market rally to ""Dow 20,000,"" are closely watched by the media. However, the S&P 500 is a far better indicator of how the stock market is doing.
The Dow has two major flaws that investors should be aware of. First, it only considers the performance of 30 companies -- hardly a good representation of the 5,000+ NYSE- and NASDAQ-listed stocks.
Second, the Dow is a price-weighted index, which means that higher-priced stocks have more influence on the index's performance than lower-priced ones. For example, at about $230 per share, Goldman Sachs has more than seven times the impact on the Dow's performance as General Electric at about $30 per share, even though General Electric is nearly three times its size, by market cap.
On the other hand, the S&P 500 considers 500 large companies as the name implies -- almost 17 times as many as the Dow. More significantly, the S&P 500 is a market cap-weighted index, meaning that larger companies have more influence over the index than smaller ones.

As 2017 shows 2016 the door, professional investors, strategists, and financial journalists participate in a time-honored tradition: the annual stock market forecast. Let me be clear: Trying to divine what 2017 holds for the S&P 500 Index (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) is a fool's  small ""f""-- errand. Let me explain why, and I'll give you an alternative stock market forecast to ponder -- one that's a lot more robust and relevant.
Wall Street strategists: ""The herd of independent minds""
According to a Bloomberg article dated Dec. 21, ""At 2,356, the average forecast called for the S&P 500 to rise almost 4 percent in 2017 from its latest close, a return that's about one-third of the 11 percent gain seen this year."" Four percent isn't much, but more interesting -- confounding, really -- than the average is the spread between the forecasts:

Biggest bull is Jonathan Golub at RBC Capital Markets, who has a year-end target of 2,500. Five strategists, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s David Kostin, Julian Emanuel of UBS AG and Bank of America Corp.'s Savita Subramanian, are tied for the least bullish, with a forecast of 2,300 -- just 30 points from Tuesday's close.

In other words, the spread between the least and most bullish forecasts is just 8% [(2,500  2,3000)/2,500 ]. The tight grouping of those forecasts brings to mind art critic Harold Rosenberg's expression, ""the herd of independent minds."" (Indeed, as the article notes, ""For the third year in a row, every strategist surveyed by Bloomberg is bullish."")
To see why this spread is confounding, let's see how it compares to reality, i.e., the S&P 500's actual annual performance during the period between 1951-2016:


 Metric
S&P 500 Annual Price Returns, 1951-2016





Highest value


45%




Lowest value


(38.5%)




Upper quintile cutoff value


23.5%




Lower quintile cutoff value


(6.6%)




Data source: Author's calculations based on data from Yahoo! Finance.
The last two lines in the table tell us that, over the 66-year period, one year in five produced an annual gain greater than or equal to 23.5% and, conversely, one year in five produced an annual loss greater than or equal to -6.6%. Put another way, two out of every five years showed returns that were outside a range 30 percentage points wide (23.5 + 6.6 = 30.1) -- a range that is itself nearly four times the width of our range of forecasts for next year.
No one knows this about stocks
Here's the blunt truth: No one knows where the S&P 500 will be 12 months from now. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has no idea (nor do any of his people). Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is clueless on the topic. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has said on multiple occasions that he is unable to forecast what the market will do looking out over 12 months and that such considerations have no impact on the way he invests.
To repeat: No one, no matter how smart, educated, connected or successful, has any idea what the stock market will do over the next 12 months. Every forecast you read on this topic is nothing more than guesswork dressed up as analysis and every person who tells you differently either doesn't understand the stock market or (more likely) is trying to sell you something.

2 things we know about stocks
On the other hand, here are two things we do know about stocks:

The stock market is now pretty expensive by historical standards.
Ten-year stock market returns are more stable and thus more predictable than one-year returns.

The following table demonstrates the second proposition -- notice the difference in the range between upper and lower quintile values between annual returns and annualized returns:

In light of those two observations, I asked a luminary on stock market valuation, finance blogger Jesse Livermore, for his long-term return forecast for the S&P 500. This is his answer from Dec. 21 (my emphasis):

I think the market [is] expensive, more expensive than at any other point in this cycle, or the last cycle. Using my estimate from Dec. 2013, I see 2-3% nominal returns over the next seven to 10 years -- that's total return [i.e., inclusive of dividends].

Jesse's model is based on his improved version of Yale economist Robert Shiller's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio.
Prepare to be underwhelmed
Given that the dividend yield on the S&P 500 is 2.1%, this forecast implies little, if any, price appreciation. A 2% to 3% average annual return is significantly lower than the historical average (the annualized average price return alone for 1951 through 2016 was 7.4%). That's worth pondering, particularly in an environment in which investors are fleeing actively managed funds and flocking to index funds.


",What Does 2017 Hold for the S&P; 500? Here's Why That's the Wrong Question

Bank of America's shares trade hands at an incredibly rapid rate. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock.
Given the central role Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) played in the financial crisis, as well as the ups and downs it's experienced since then, it probably won't surprise you to hear that its stock is heavily traded. But just how heavily traded it is may in fact come as a shock.
Bank of America's average daily trading volume
When you look at the average daily trading volume of Bank of America's shares, no other blue-chip stock even comes close.
Over the last month, an average of 143 million shares of the North Carolina-based bank have changed hands each day. That compares to an average daily volume of only five million shares for the typical stock on the S&P 500.
Even if you compare Bank of America to the other heavily traded stocks on the S&P 500, it's still in a league of its own. The average daily volume of the runner-up, Chesapeake Energy, amounts to only 55 million shares. That's only a little more than a third of Bank of America's volume.

What's going on here?
To understand why Bank of America's shares are so heavily traded, you have to look at the issue from both a short- and a long-term perspective.
Over the short-term, the trading in Bank of America's shares soared as a result of the presidential election. President-elect Donald Trump's promise to boost fiscal spending and ""dismantle"" the Dodd-Frank Act have magnified the market's focus on bank stocks.
If Trump is able to get his proposals through Congress, which seems reasonable to assume given that Republicans control the House and the Senate, then banks should make a lot more money. This is why bank stocks have outperformed the broader market since the beginning of November.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-45537');
            });
        


And no bank stock stands to benefit more from these changes than Bank of America. It went into the election with one of the lowest valuations in the bank industry, and it stands to gain more than most banks from an improving economy and eased regulations.

Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author.
But even though Bank of America's trading volume has surged since the election, it was already elevated. When its share price dropped in the wake of the financial crisis, thanks to dramatically dilutive share offerings, it became a favorite of hedge funds, which could afford to trade many millions of its shares for the same cost as only hundreds of thousands of shares of other banks.
To this end, prior to the crisis, Bank of America's average daily trading volume was only around 15 million shares a day. That's a tenth of its current level.

Consequently, by combining these two things -- the financial crisis and the presidential election -- one is able to understand why Bank of America's stock remains the most actively traded member of the S&P 500.

For most investors, Friday was a day to celebrate. The Dow Jones Industrials climbed 250 points on the day, and the S&P 500 closed at 2,130, less than a single point below its closing all-time high. The economic news that sent markets soaring was the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which included favorable stats of 287,000 new jobs created in June. Unemployment rates rose to 4.9%, but that came, in part, from a substantial rise in the size of the civilian labor force on an unadjusted basis.
Broader market indexes rose about 1.5%, but some stocks failed to participate in the rally. Among the biggest losers were PriceSmart (NASDAQ:PSMT), Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE), and the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (NYSEMKT:VXX).
PriceSmart sees same-store sales fall
PriceSmart fell 9% after the international warehouse retailer reported its operational results from its fiscal third quarter. The company said that club sales rose 1.4% from the year-ago quarter, with overall revenue also climbing a bit more than 1%. However, operating income fell by nearly a fifth, to $27.5 million, and net income of $16.8 million worked out to $0.55 per share in earnings, which was far less than the $0.70 per-share consensus figure among those following the stock.
In addition, comparable warehouse sales for June were down 1.9%, extending poor year-to-date figures that include a 0.9% drop in comps over the first 10 months of the fiscal year. The devaluation of the Colombian peso was part of the reason for the decline, but some fear more lasting impacts that could hurt PriceSmart's prospects in its other key markets.
Kite Pharma falls in a sector downdraft
Kite Pharma shares lost 7% in sympathy with another big loser on the day. Rival Juno Therapeutics had to halt a clinical trial for its lead JCAR015 therapy for treating a type of adult leukemia.
Patient deaths were the cause of the clinical hold, and the FDA move raised concerns not only about Juno's treatments, but also other developers using chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells as a potential way to fight disease. Kite Pharma has hoped that its KTE-C19 candidate to fight non-Hodgkin's lymphoma could become a successful treatment. But if the FDA grows nervous about CAR-T cell therapies generally, it could pose a future threat to Kite's prospects, as well.

The market boost hurts the fear index
Finally, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN dropped 6%. Big positive days for the stock market tend to make the S&P Volatility Index, also known as the VIX, fall. Investors use the volatility measure as a gauge of market fear, and today's push to near-record highs indicates a great deal of confidence in the market's prospects.
Consequently, the drop in the VIX led to a decline in this exchange-traded product, which tracks short-term futures contracts on the volatility index. Many shareholders in the ETN believe that the market can't sustain its gains, but its price hit its lowest levels in its history on Friday.

You probably won't be surprised to hear that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) makes a lot of money. But what may surprise you is the fact that only three companies on the S&P 500 earn more than the California-based bank: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).
Wells Fargo's net income over the past 12 months adds up to $22.6 billion. That puts it right on the heels of Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, which earned $24.5 billion and $24.1 billion, respectively, over the same stretch. It's worth pointing out that Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest investor in Wells Fargo. The Warren Buffett-led company owns roughly 10% of the nation's third biggest bank by assets.
Apple, by contrast, has separated itself from the pack when it comes to earnings. Thanks to the popularity of the iPhone, which accounts for three-quarters of the company's revenue, Apple has generated $50.7 billion in net income over the past year. This is why Apple is the largest company in America based on market capitalization.

Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author.
Wells Fargo's rank as the fourth most profitable company on the S&P 500 is notable for two reasons. The first is that the bank has only recently ascended to these heights. Prior to the financial crisis, it was a regional bank that operated, for the most part, west of the Mississippi River. At the end of 2007, for instance, it had $575 billion in assets. Flash forward to today and the figure has grown to $1.8 trillion.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-13562');
            });
        


A significant portion of this growth came from Wells Fargo's 2008 acquisition of Wachovia, which had run into trouble with subprime mortgages. Wachovia was larger than Wells Fargo at the time and thus doubled the latter's size.
The rest of the growth was either organic -- i.e., loan growth -- or derived from portfolio acquisitions, such as its deal last year to buy multiple loan portfolios and business lines from GE Capital. The deal included total assets of approximately $32 billion as well as businesses employing approximately 3,000 team members, according to a Wells Fargo press release.
The second reason that Wells Fargo's rank as the fourth most profitable company in America is surprising is because the bank industry is laboring right now through one of the worst interest rate environments in modern history. With short-term interest rates continuing to hover between 0.25% and 0.50%, banks are earning a fraction on their loan portfolios relative to what they would under a more normal scenario. To this end, higher rates alone could boost Wells Fargo's top line by tens of billions of dollars.
Surprising or not, Wells Fargo's place among the top-earning companies in the United States should be settling to the bank's shareholders. The more a bank earns, the better equipped it is to survive future economic downturns without permanently impairing shareholder value.

Sometimes you just have to take a step back and stare in awe at the stock market. Just two months ago we were talking about the possibility of the broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) breaching its old ""supports"" and heading to a fresh two-year low. Today, we're well within striking distance of the S&P 500 claiming an all-time record closing high (which happens to be 2,130.82, set back on May 21, 2015).
How did we go from the worst start in recorded history to the most voracious rally within a quarter in decades? While no one knows the answer to this question with any certainty, I'd propose three factors were at play.
Three probable reasons behind the market's surprising Q1 turnaround First, it's plausible that investors' emotions calmed a bit. Emotions are best left out of investing, but that only works in instances where investors are thinking long-term. Hedge funds are often geared to performing for their members in the short-term, which means some big money movements during the first quarter were likely influenced more by short-term emotions than actual fundamentals.
Secondly, it appears investors decided that global and domestic growth concerns aren't as dire as they thought. Sure, China may have produced its weakest full year of GDP growth in quite some time in 2015, but it's still growing its GDP at a brisk 6.8% as of the fourth quarter. Similarly, slower GDP growth in the U.S. has been met with dovish Federal Reserve policy. Once expected to hike lending rates four times in 2016, the Fed has backed off its tightening stance and is now looking to give the U.S. economy more time to find its footing. Although global growth may not be what investors wish it was, it doesn't appear as if a domestic or global recession is looming either.

Finally, history may have played a role. An interesting statistic proposed by ZeroHedge recently is that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped at least 10% in 26 quarters since 1900 and managed to recover at least 8% from its low during the quarter. ZeroHedge points out that all but two of these drops occurred during secular bear markets.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-31638');
            });
        


What I'd add is that history has unequivocally shown that markets tend to move higher over time, and investors may have taken advantage of this perfect track record. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has undergone 35 stock market corrections, and every single one of those corrections has been completely erased by a bull market rally or bear market rebound in a matter of weeks, months, or years. There is no better track record than that.
Moves you should consider making with the S&P 500 nearing a new all-time high With the S&P 500 seemingly knocking on the door of 2,100, you might be wondering if it's time to change up your investing strategy. My suggestion would be to consider implementing three key strategies to take advantage of the market regardless of where it heads in the short-term.
1. Think long-term and keep buying on a regular basis The first thing you'll want to do is not stray away from your usual investing habits. If you invest a certain sum of money every month or quarter, you should continue to do so regardless of where the stock market indexes are valued. Since the stock market has demonstrated a tendency to increase in value over time, buying at regular intervals should allow you to dollar-cost average into high quality stocks at a lower long-term price.
Additionally, buying and holding over the long run will give you a major advantage come tax time. When it comes time to take profits on your holdings, long-term capital gains are taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20%, based on your adjusted gross income. By comparison, short-term capital gains, or assets held for one year or less, are taxed at a rate commensurate with your peak marginal tax rate. This could mean paying 10%, to as high as 39.6%, on any short-term gains.

            });

2. Reassess your portfolio monthly  The second thing you'll want to do is to reassess your portfolio on a monthly basis, which really shouldn't take much time at all and should be done in both rising and falling markets. In effect, all you're doing is looking back at your investment thesis in a company and deciding if the reasons why you bought that company in the first place are still valid. This does mean you'll need to keep up with potentially thesis-altering news for the companies that you own, but it doesn't mean you should be waiting on the edge of your seat for every five-cent uptick or downtick in share price.
What are thesis-altering events? I'd define them as anything that disrupts a company's business model or long-term outlook. It could be a new innovation or product from a competitor, a change in tax laws or regulations within an industry, or a failed product or service that was critical to a company's long-term growth. If your investment thesis no longer holds water for a company, it may be time to consider selling.
3. Protect yourself with dividend stocks Finally, you may want to consider buffering your portfolio with high-quality dividend stocks.

Image source: Pictures of Money via Flickr.

Dividend stocks offer a number of advantages to investors in any market environment. First, they act as a beacon alerting investors to a successful business model. Presumably, businesses wouldn't be sharing their profits with investors if they weren't viewed as stable and profitable. Secondly, dividend payments can help hedge against stock market corrections. This hedge becomes more pronounced over time, as you'll see in the next point. Third, dividends can be reinvested back into more shares of dividend-paying stocks, thus setting yourself up for a revolving pattern of bigger dividends and more shares of stock owned. This process is commonly known as compounding among the investing community.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-41269');
            });
        


Also, understand that buying dividend stocks is about more than just yield. Sometimes dividend yields rise because share prices are falling. If that's the case, you'll need to be vigilant that a company's business model is still healthy and set to grow over the long-term.
Long story short, a possible new all-time high for the S&P 500 shouldn't mean a revamp to your investing strategy.

IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN WATER WORKS.

What happened?A gusher has hit the S&P 500: Liquid utility American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is now a component of the benchmark large-cap index, effective as of the opening of trading on Friday.
American Water Works, the biggest publicly traded water and wastewater utility in the U.S., replaces coal and natural gas producer CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) in the index.
CONSOL Energy is departing because it has been tapped to replace software and services company Solera Holdings (NYSE:SLH) in the S&P Mid Cap 400 index. Solera Holdings was acquired by affiliates of a private equity operator, Vista Equity Partners, in a deal that closed on Thursday.

Does it matter?Inclusion in the S&P 500 is prestigious, as it's probably the highest-profile index for well-capitalized companies. That, in itself, should raise interest in American Water Works.
Additionally, being part of the index makes the company a target for the many exchange-traded funds that trawl indexes for stocks to hold (not to mention other types of funds that comb them for the same purpose). This will almost certainly support or enhance American Water Works' stock price, although it will likely make little difference to the company's fundamentals.

            });
        


As for CONSOL Energy, the impact shouldn't be as great. Although shifting from the S&P 500 to the S&P Mid Cap 400 could be seen as a demotion of sorts, the company is still on an important index, and thus very much on the radar of ETFs and other big investors.
For Solera Holdings, of course, all of these factors are moot, as it's now under new, private ownership.





",Instant Analysis: American Water Works Replaces CONSOL Energy in the S&P; 500
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/instant-analysis-concho-resources-replaces-plum-cr.aspx,2016-02-24,"

What happened?The benchmark S&P 500 index has a new member. Say hello to oil and gas company Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO), which has stepped in to replace specialty real estate investment trust Plum Creek Timber (NYSE:PCL) as an index component.
Plum Creek Timber got the chop because it has been acquired by fellow REIT Weyerhaeuser (NYSE:WY), in a deal worth over $8 billion. Plum Creek Timber owns a swath of timberland across the U.S.; those holdings will complement the acreage controlled by Weyerhaeuser.
The switch took effect on Feb. 19. Concho Resources, which is headquartered in Texas and has assets in the Permian Basin mostly located in that state, will also be included in the S&P 500's oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry index.

Does it matter?Almost certainly. Now that Concho Resources is slotted into the S&P 500, it'll find its way into exchange-traded funds that dip into the index for their portfolios. The increased demand from these sorts of funds (plus others that like to sniff around high-profile indexes) should help lift and support the stock price.
Although times are tough for oil and gas concerns given the dramatic slide in crude prices since last year, Concho Resources' fundamentals and stock price have actually held up relatively well. The company is still profitable, not very heavily leveraged, and operates in a very attractive region with much potential.

Exiting the index won't have much of an effect on Plum Creek Timber, of course, as it's going to be folded into Weyerhaeuser. The latter company, by the way, is already an S&P 500 component.

Thursday was another good day for the stock market, as investors carried over their enthusiasm into a second day following the Wednesday afternoon announcement of the latest decision of the Federal Reserve on interest rates. Stable rates sent markets higher yesterday, and gains continued today, although the extent of the move was more modest.
Most major market benchmarks rose between half a percent and 1%, and bullish investors believe that the Fed's choice not to raise rates should bode well for stocks for the rest of the year. Yet some specific investments didn't fare as well, and among the worst performers were Omnova Solutions (NYSE:OMN), Jabil Circuit (NYSE:JBL), and the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (NYSEMKT:VXX).
Omnova falls short on financials
Omnova Solutions dropped 15% in the wake of its fiscal third-quarter results. The maker of engineered surfaces and specialty chemicals said that sales for the quarter dropped 7% from the year-ago period, producing adjusted earnings of $0.14 per share, up $0.01 from last year's fiscal third quarter.
The performance chemicals segment produced volume increases, but the engineered surfaces business suffered from customer delays and poor timing of start-ups in flooring-plant operations that will eventually add to Omnova's overall business. With a great deal of consolidation activity in the industry, Omnova will have to do its best to navigate tough conditions and find ways to support its own growth going forward.
Jabil Circuit deals with downgrades after reporting declining earnings
Jabil Circuit finished down 6% after reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results Wednesday night. The company said that quarterly revenue came in at $4.4 billion, helping Jabil close a record year in terms of its top-line performance. CEO Mark Mondello was quite pleased with the report, noting that the year ""was characterized by a blend of exceptional performance, significant variability, excellent cost control, and wonderful customer care.""
Yet some are concerned that, given Jabil's exposure to the coming launch of the iPhone 7, the stock is vulnerable to any disappointment in early sales of the new smartphone. If the phone does better than expected, however, that could presumably put more momentum into Jabil's upward movement.

Volatility takes a hit
Finally, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN sank 3%. The Fed's move has dampened expectations for volatility, and when that happens, the iPath ETN typically loses ground. Indeed, the drop puts the exchange-traded product very close to an all-time low, and the market has thus far withstood historically downward movements that often occur in the month of September. Without a big downward move in the stock market sometime this fall, the path of least resistance for the iPath ETN is likely to be downward for the foreseeable future.

Thursday was a surprisingly positive day on Wall Street, with major market benchmarks posting gains of between 1.25% and 1.5% on the day, despite the sense of anticipation about a long-awaited event. For weeks, investors have had their attention on Great Britain, where voters went to the polls today to vote on whether the U.K. would remain part of the European Union. Early indications had suggested that an exit was likely, but in recent days, the pendulum has appeared to swing toward staying in the EU.
Investors in the U.S. have taken that as an encouraging sign, and that helped the Dow climb more than 230 points to top the 18,000 mark. However, some stocks missed out on the celebration, and among the worst-performing investments on the day were Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL), Finish Line (NASDAQ:FINL), and the iPath S&P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN (NYSEMKT:VXX).
Whiting Petroleum fell more than 6% after the company came to an understanding with creditors to exchange more than $1 billion in existing debt for mandatory convertible notes for the same total-principal amount. The exchange has no impact on the maturity dates of the notes, but they allow the energy company to force note holders to convert a portion of their notes into shares of Whiting common stock if the price of the stock exceeds $8.75 per share on a weighted-average basis during each of the next 25 trading days.
Given that the stock currently trades above $11 per share, the likelihood is that bondholders will end up with between 83 million and 115 million shares of stock. That represents a huge amount of dilution for a company that previously had only about 210 million shares outstanding.
Finish Line dropped 4% as investors await the athletic-shoe retailer's first-quarter earnings report on Friday. Shareholders currently expect the company to report a modest 1% gain in overall revenue, but earnings per share will drop by roughly 25% from year-ago levels.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-51162');
            });
        


The retailer already plans to close many of its less-profitable store locations during the next several years in an effort to boost earnings growth. However, intense competition among footwear manufacturers seeking to build out their own direct-distribution channels to customers via company websites and proprietary-store networks could eat into Finish Line's growth prospects. Moreover, rival Foot Locker will continue to fight hard to take advantage of the bankruptcy of industry peer Sports Authority, and hold back Finish Line's ability to grow.
Finally, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN dropped almost 10%. The exchange-traded product is designed to track the most-popular measure of stock-market volatility. On days when the stock market performs particularly well, the underlying volatility index tends to drop precipitously.
The move comes as a shock, given the anticipation of what could be extensive market moves depending on the way the Brexit decision goes. However, today's move is just the latest in a long series of setbacks for long-term holders of the exchange-traded product, and despite some occasional short-term spikes, the trajectory of the iPath ETN has pointed downward for years because of the resolute nature of the long bull market.

What's the S&P 500 going to do in 2017? It's a question we'd all love the answer to, as it can inform financial decisions we make throughout the year. If it's going to drop, for example, we might want to sell some or many holdings now. If it's going to rise, we can relax and perhaps buy more stocks. Unfortunately, though, despite what many financial pundits suggest, no one can know just what the S&P 500 will do next year.

Trying to imagine what investors (especially naive ones) might have been thinking in various years -- without the benefit of hindsight -- can be enlightening. For example, if you were invested in 1993 and 1994 and saw returns in the single digits, you might have had low expectations for the next few years. But look at 1995! The market shot up by close to 40%! That was followed by another banner year, with a rise of nearly 23% in 1996. Those two years alone would have turned a $1,000 investment into $1,683! It would seem quite reasonable, then, to expect a pullback in 1997, but instead we got an even bigger climb, of 33%, followed by two more years of gains topping 20%.
Then, in 2000, 2001, and 2002, there were three years of declines, and increasingly large ones. That would have put many people off of stocks, but the following year saw a big bounce. From 2003 to the present, the S&P 500 only had one bad year -- though it was a doozy, with a drop of close to 37% in 2008.
How is the S&P 500 doing in 2016? Well, as of Dec. 14, it was up 12.6%.
The dangers of market timing
After that history lesson, and considering that the market hasn't had a down year in a long time, you may still be tempted to expect a drop in 2017. It certainly might happen. But it might not, too. So if you sell in preparation for a drop, you might end up on the sidelines during another big run -- at which time you really  won't want to buy back into the market as it will seem even more like it's due to drop.
A 2008 commentary from the folks at SEI illustrated this with numbers:



Strategy, 1926-2007

Annualized Return

Growth of $100,000





Exit when market declines; Stay out until market has a decent year


8.4%


$72.6 million




Exit when market is ""too high""; Stay out until after a down year


8.3%


$70.7 million




Remain invested through ups and downs


10.4%


$323.9 million




Data source: SEI.

Remaining invested can be easier said than done, though, as we often act on our emotions, not our reasoning. Data from Dalbar & Lipper offer another example of just how destructive our emotions can be to our wealth. Between 1996 and 2015, stock mutual funds averaged annual gains of 7.7%. That's enough to turn a single $10,000 investment in 1996 to $44,000 by the end of 2015. Amazingly, though, the average annual gain of the average stock mutual fund investor was just 4.7% over the same period. Growing at 4.7% annually over 20 years, a $10,000 investment will become...$25,000, fully $19,000 less. Why the difference? Well, it reflects investors selling out of their funds when afraid and jumping back in when greedy. The bigger gain was realized only by those who sat put. Trading in and out of stocks or funds can also rack up commission costs and can lead to short-term gains, which are generally taxed at higher rates than long-term gains.
Remember, all market crashes have been followed by recoveries. Check out this graph that Morgan Housel offered last year:

What to do
So what should you expect from the S&P 500 in 2017? Well, expect anything. Prepare to hang on if the market surges -- though you might sell some holdings if they simply seem very overvalued -- and to hang on if the market tanks. In fact, a market crash offers excellent entry points for many stocks, so prepare to snap up some stocks on your wish list, should the S&P 500 crash in 2017.
In the meantime, keep only your long-term money in stocks, as you don't want to have to make withdrawals during a bear market.

",The S&P; in 2017: What to Expect
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/17/sp-global-upgraded-what-you-need-to-know.aspx,2017-04-17,"
Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...
Finding bargain stocks in an overvalued market is no easy task, but finding relative bargains? Stocks that, if not necessarily cheap, may at least be cheaper than the average stock on the S&P 500, where price-to-earnings ratios continue to float north of 26? That may be a bit easier to do.
In fact, Raymond James thinks it has done it -- and that's why the investment banker upgraded shares of financial data and analytics specialist S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) this morning. Here are three things you need to know about the upgrade.

Up 27% in a year, one banker thinks S&P Global stock could go up some more. Image source: Getty Images.

1. Like a phoenix from the ashes reborn
Long regarded as one of the ""villains"" of the 2008 financial crisis, in which its debt-rating arm was accused of handing out too-high ratings for banks' issuances of mortgage-backed securities, S&P Global began pulling itself out of the ashes last year. In 2014, the company incurred $1.6 billion in legal and other costs relating to the crisis, pushing its bottom line into the red. Then, in 2015, the movie The Big Short came out, reminding investors how S&P Global got itself into trouble in the first place.
But S&P pulled through like a champ, first honing its business model with the $2.2 billion purchase of SNL Financial in 2015, then exiting its non-core educational textbooks business in 2016, and finally changing its name (the company had previously been known as McGraw-Hill).
Result: One year after its loss, S&P Global reported $1.2 billion in fiscal 2015 profits, then nearly doubled those profits to $2.1 billion in 2016.
2. Raymond likes S&P Global
Raymond James thinks the good news won't stop there. As reported this morning on StreetInsider.com, Raymond James has decided to upgrade S&P Global stock from market perform to outperform, and is assigning a new price target of $143, implying about 12% upside to the shares.
Why? Raymond James sees S&P Global growing its revenue at a consistent, double-digit growth rate over the next several years. The analyst also believes that S&P will be able to expand the profit margin it earns on that revenue. (Indeed, since the dark days of 2014, S&P Global has already added 150 basis points to its gross margin, and grown its operating profit margin by 460 basis points, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence itself.)
With a 68.8% gross profit margin and a 40.4% operating profit margin, S&P Global now easily outclasses archrival Thomson Reuters' (NYSE:TRI) numbers (28.2% and 13.8%, respectively).




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-87438');
            });
        

3. Valuing the options
But are those numbers good enough to justify buying S&P Global over Thomson Reuters stock -- or any other stock, for that matter?
Let's consider: Valued at $33.6 billion and $31.4 billion respectively, S&P Global and Thomson Reuters are roughly the same size by market capitalization. This is despite the fact that Thomson Reuters rakes in much more revenue ($11.2 billion annually) than S&P ($5.7 billion), and largely because S&P Global earns much better profits off the revenue it does collect. This also explains why investors value S&P Global stock so much more richly as a multiple of its profits -- 15.7 times earnings as opposed to Thomson Reuters' P/E of 10.
That said, when you consider these valuations in light of the stocks' respective growth rates, I cannot help but think that Raymond James has missed the point: Thomson Reuters stock actually looks to me to be more of a bargain than S&P Global.
The most important thing: Considering your alternatives
Here's why: Compare S&P Global's 15.7 P/E ratio to analysts' projection of 13.5% long-term annual earnings growth and the stock's 1.3% dividend yield. Those two latter numbers add up to a total return of 14.8% on S&P Global stock, and when divided into the P/E, a total return ratio of about 1.1. While I agree with Raymond James that this is a ""reasonable"" valuation, as TheFly.com reports, it's not yet cheap.
For cheap, look instead to Thomson Reuters. There, 10 times earnings matches up nicely with analysts' projected 10% long-term growth rate. Factor a 3.2% dividend yield into the mix, and Thomson Reuters stock generates a total return ratio of less than 0.8 -- which most definitely is cheap.
Long story short: I agree with the analyst that S&P Global stock sells for a reasonable price and presents a decent value at today's prices. But Thomson Reuters is the cheaper stock for long-term profits.

1. Hawaiian Holdings 

HA data by YCharts.
Up 976% in the last five years, Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) has been riding a bullish wave in the airline industry. A raft of mergers in recent years has consolidated much of the industry and eliminated competition. More recently, lower oil prices have been a boon to airline profits as fuel is a significant cost input for them. All major airlines have outperformed the market in that period, tripling their stock prices or better, but Hawaiian Holdings has been the best of the best.
Hawaiian has benefited from strong demand for flights to Hawaii and smart management that's generated an industry-best revenue per available seat mile, a key industry metric. In fact, it was the only U.S. airline to show off growth in that category at 2% last year, and RASM growth accelerated to 7.7% in the first quarter. 
A reputation for better customer service has enabled Hawaiian to charge slightly higher prices for its seats as it's the only U.S. airline to still serve a full meal on every flight. 
Hawaiian stock jumped 4% after its recent earnings report as adjusted earnings per share increased 30%. While Hawaiian Holdings' fortunes going forward will be closely tied to the airline industry's, the company has shown a consistent ability to outperform and should continue to do well if the industry economics remain favorable.

2. Constellation Brands 

STZ data by YCharts.
Shares of beer, wine, and liquor distributor Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) have surged 710% since 2012 thanks in large part to a deal the company made with Anheuser-Busch InBev to give it U.S distribution rights over Corona, Modelo and other Mexican-made beers under Grupo Modelo. 
In February 2013, the company purchased the Piedras Negras brewery for $2.9 billion from AB InBev and $1.85 billion for the half of Crown Imports, a U.S beer distributor, that it didn't already own. Alcohol giant AB InBev divested the stake in Crown Imports and the brewery in order to gain regulatory clearance to take over Grupo Modelo.
Constellation stock along with sales and profits went on a tear following the deal as Corona has since become the No. 5 beer in the U.S.
The stock plateaued last year and sunk after the election on fears that a border tax would dent its profits as its business is now largely dependent on its Mexican imports business. Shares have returned to all-time highs since then as concerns about such a border tax have moderated, and Constellation delivered strong earnings growth in its most recent earnings report. Still, with much of the benefits of the Corona deal now absorbed, Constellation's growth over the next five years is likely to be slower, though the company continues to make smaller acquisitions.

CEO Bruce Cazenave took over in 2011 and refocused the company on retail sales rather than direct sales, spending more on research and development and bringing products to market more quickly. 
Pretty much all of the stock's entire growth over the last five years came by 2015 as enthusiasm for the turnaround peaked, but earnings continue to grow. With a modest P/E ratio of just 17, I'd expect the stock's growth to return soon as the increase in Nautilus' earnings has now nearly caught up to the stock appreciation. While the comeback story that drove the stock earlier has changed as Nautilus is now a healthy company, the stock should continue to outperform.

",These 3 Stocks Are Up Over 500% in the Last Five Years
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/07/electronic-arts-stock-up-500-over-last-5-years-wha.aspx,2017-05-07,"
Over the last five years, the S&P 500 Index is up about 70%. This return is no match for Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) roughly 500% return over the same time period, but what can investors expect for the next five years? Will the stock continue to be a home run for shareholders?
We'll review how the stock delivered its massive run over the last five years, and what expectations investors should hold for the next five.
How Electronic Arts stock delivered 500%

EA has fueled its run with in-game content sales from hit franchises like Battlefield. IMAGE SOURCE: ELECTRONIC ARTS INC. 

The video game industry has been undergoing a very profitable shift from physical sales of game discs to digital distribution, where players can purchase and download games directly through their consoles. This has been a common method of buying games for a long time with PC gamers, but it's just now catching on with console gamers. There has been no greater beneficiary of this business model shift than Electronic Arts.
In April 2012, EA had just wrapped up its fiscal 2012 year ending in March, where it reported $4.1 billion in net revenue and $0.23 in earnings per share. The company was in the middle of a major turnaround effort after reporting losses on the bottom line for several years. Management was aggressively pursuing higher-margin digital revenue sources, including mobile games and additional in-game content distributed directly to gamers via console, in order to position the company for long-term profitable growth.
The reason for EA's phenomenal stock performance cannot be explained by any new blockbuster games released, as the company is still producing the same hit titles, such as FIFA, Battlefield, and Mass Effect. Total revenue hasn't grown much, as EA is expected to report $4.8 billion in revenue for fiscal 2017, a cumulative increase of only 17% over fiscal 2012. 
The main reason for the stock's 500% gain is that digital revenue went from less than 30% of total revenue five years ago to 56% for the trailing-12-month period ending December 2016, as more gamers continued to purchase games, along with additional in-game content, directly through their consoles as opposed to buying physical game discs. This caused gross margin to expand from 61.4% in fiscal 2012 to an expected 72.1% for fiscal 2017.
The increase in gross profit dropped all the way to the bottom line as EA is expected to report $3.83 in earnings per share for fiscal 2017, a compound annual growth rate of 75% since fiscal 2012. In April 2012, EA stock traded for about $15.50 per share, and the trailing-12-month PE ratio was 67 -- expensive by conventional standards. However, the high valuation was a sign that investors were expecting rapid growth in earnings as management pursued its turnaround strategy -- and EA delivered, big time.

EA data by YCharts.
What to expect over the next five years
Since the company is further down the line in building out its digital revenue channels across mobile games and direct buying through consoles, I expect EA to grow its earnings, but nowhere near 75% per year over the next five years. Here's why investors should lower their expectations.
1. Slowing digital revenue growth: Although digital revenue is still growing fast, at 18% over the trailing-12-month period, this is way down from the 47% growth rate EA was posting five years ago, when the company was just getting the ball rolling on its digital revenue opportunities.
2. Moderating earnings growth: Stemming from slower digital revenue growth, the last three years have shown a moderating growth rate in earnings per share. EA's fiscal 2017 expected earnings should show 21% year-over-year growth (assuming the company reports $3.83 for full-year earnings per share), which is down from the previous year's 30% growth rate.

EA's 21% growth rate for fiscal 2017 was based on a year when the company released a new Battlefield version, one of its best-selling games. For fiscal 2018, the company will be releasing a new Star Wars: Battlefront game, which produces lower margins than Battlefield because of the cost of the licensed content EA pays to Walt Disney's Lucasfilm subsidiary. As a result, analysts are expecting EA's earnings growth to slow to 8% in fiscal 2018, with growth through the next five years expected to average 16.5% per year.

            });
        

Electronic Arts should be a rewarding investment
I expect physical sales of games will continue to slowly decline, digital revenue will continue growing around 15% per year or faster, and gross margin will continue to gradually expand over the next five years as digital revenue becomes a greater percentage of total revenue.
While I wouldn't expect the stock to return anything close to 500% by 2022, I think analyst estimates of mid-teen level growth are very reasonable, and with the stock trading for 22 times fiscal 2018 expected earnings, investors are arguably getting a good deal.

If you have an extra $500 in savings, and you're wondering how to spend it wisely, you might want to consider these 15 ideas. 

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

1. Invest in an index ETF
Investing in the stock market can be confusing, and if the thousands of investment options are keeping you from getting started, then it might make the most sense to focus on the S&P 500 index. The index includes the biggest and most profitable companies in America, and many of those companies reward investors with dividends. Historically, dividend-paying stocks have outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks, so this could be a savvy move. Wondering how to buy the S&P 500? Consider Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO). It has an absolutely rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.05%, and that means more money in your account, and less money in your broker's wallet.

2. Pay down credit cards
According to creditcards.com, the average interest rate charged on a credit card is 15.07%, and even if your rate is lower than that, a decision by the Federal Reserve to increase rates up to three times this year means that your rate could be heading higher. Rather than pay more money to your credit card company, consider using your extra money to pay off some of your debt. If you lower your balance by $500, you'll save $75 in your first year, at today's interest rates.

            });
        

3. Make an extra payment on a mortgage
Sure, $500 may not seem like a lot when you owe $100,000 or more on a home, but you'd be surprised how much you can save in total interest over the life of your mortgage by paying an extra $500 toward it every year.
According to mortgagecalculator.org, increasing your monthly payment by $41.67 per month will turn a $100,000 30-year mortgage into a 25.8-year mortgage, and it will save you $13,697 in interest payments over the loan period, assuming a 4.5% interest rate.

4. Start an IRA
IRAs are one of the best investment tools out there, because contributing to one can save you money at tax time. A traditional IRA, for example, allows you to take a tax deduction in the amount of your contribution. So if you're in a 25% marginal income tax bracket, the tax savings are meaningful on a $500 contribution.
If you don't pay taxes, or you think your tax rate may be higher in retirement than it is now, then a Roth IRA might be a better choice. You don't get the tax break up front, but money can be withdrawn from a Roth IRA in retirement tax free, including gains, as long as you follow the rules.

            });
        

5. Consolidate some debt
If you have a lot of expensive debt on one credit card, and a lot of room on another credit card, it may make sense to pay a fee to transfer some of that debt to a card that has a better rate.
Most credit card companies charge between 3% to 4% to transfer balances, so paying a $500 fee could allow you to transfer as much as almost $17,000. Assuming the national average interest rate of 15% on your expensive credit card, and a 0% transfer offer that's good for 12 months on your other card, you could save over $2,000 in one year, after fees.

6. Buy life insurance
No one wants to think about their own mortality, but if you have a family that depends on your income to pay day-to-day expenses, then buying a term life insurance policy could be smart. Term life insurance prices vary, but a healthy person in his or her 30s can reasonably expect to buy a $500,000 policy for about $500, or less, per year. Usually, your beneficiary won't have to pay taxes when he or she receives life insurance, so owning a term policy like this can provide significant peace of mind.

            });
        

7. Fix your car
The average cost of a new car is at a record high that's north of $30,000, and with interest rates climbing, financing a new car is getting even more expensive. Rather than trading in your old car and taking on hundreds of dollars in monthly payments, a better option may be finding a reliable mechanic. Most mechanics can thoroughly inspect your car in an hour, or less, and afterward they can give you an honest opinion about how long your vehicle might last. If your car only requires regular maintenance items, such as brakes or tie rods, paying for those repairs could be smarter than paying thousands of dollars per year in new monthly payments.

8. Get a health screening
If you're unhealthy, you can't work, and if you can't work, you run the risk of losing out on income. Oftentimes, preventative health screening can catch health problems before they become chronic and costly.
For example, your health insurance may not cover the cost of lab work, such as cholesterol screening, but people with risk factors, such as high blood pressure and a family history of stroke, can get a work-up for less than $500. Those lab results can help doctors make recommendations that could delay or prevent heart disease, allowing you to live longer, and avoid costly hospitalizations and surgery.

9. Get a certificate
The average American worker got a 2.9% income bump in the past year, according to Glassdoor, and if you got less than that, or you'd like to get an even bigger raise, then you might want to invest in some additional training that you can mention to your supervisor during your next review.
Community colleges and universities offer certificate programs across a variety of industries and job functions, so if you're unsure what certification to seek out, ask your human resources department or manager for suggestions. You might even discover that your employer is willing to split the cost of training with you.

10. Plant a garden
A family of four can easily spend more than $150 per week on groceries, according to the USDA, and if you buy a lot of fresh food, then that bill could head north of $200 per week.
Instead of paying out that much every week, consider investing in a garden that can provide you with fruits and vegetables to eat year round. One tip: Starter plants grown at a local nursery cost more than seeds, but if they've been grown nearby, they have a better chance of surviving in your climate and soil. Also, depending on your diet (and your town's zoning restrictions), consider building a pen to house hens for eggs, too. 
One caveat: If you don't have a green thumb, it's best to leave the gardening to the professionals.

11. Weatherize your home
If you live in an older home, you could be wasting a lot of money on home heating and cooling every year. Rather than watch your bills increase, it could make sense to take action and get rid of some drafts. While $500 isn't going to buy you new windows throughout your home, it can help you add attic insulation and seal windows and doors. If you don't manage your home's temperature with a programmable thermostat, buying one can reduce unnecessary costs of heating and cooling your home when you're at work or asleep.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

12. Get your system cleaned
Speaking of heating and cooling costs, if you're neglecting your heating or cooling system's annual maintenance, you could be using more fuel and electricity than you should be, and that can be costly. Even worse, forgoing regular maintenance on these systems can lead to their early failure, and if that happens, you could face costs in the thousands of dollars for repairs or replacement. Given that risk, spending a few hundred dollars to get your systems in tip-top shape can be money well spent.

13. Take a trip
Up for a change? Now might be the perfect time to travel to another part of the country and consider a career change. Incomes differ greatly depending on where you live, and so can living expenses. Changing jobs can net an average 4.5% pay increase, according to ADP, and if that pay increase is for a job in a low-cost state, that's even better.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

14. Join a gym
Sticking with a gym membership isn't easy, but people who go regularly to gym may discover it's not just good for their physical health. Researchers published a study in the Journal of Labor in 2012 showing that employees who exercise regularly earn 9% more than their peers. Based on today's average income, getting that kind of a bump up in earnings should more than cover the cost of joining a gym. Memberships at value-oriented gyms can be as cheap as $10 per month, and memberships at slightly more upscale gyms can still cost less than $500 per year.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

15. Start networking
People who find jobs through their career network get hired 55% faster, according to Jobvite, and mentoring and guidance provided by a network can significantly improve your chances of getting offered jobs before they're advertised. While some networking opportunities are easier to spot than others, many industries have groups that meet regularly, and joining a club focusing on your favorite hobby can open doors, too. If you're a college graduate, a great place to begin searching for networking events is by making a call to your school's alumni office. Often, you'll find plenty of alumni outings nearby, and while you'll spend some money on clothes, dinners, and outings, it could help you land your dream job.

Biotech stocks are not for the faint of heart.
The majority of publicly traded biotechs are not yet profitable, which leads investors to value them by guessing about the future revenue potential of their pipeline based on how well drugs perform in clinical trails. Breaking news can lead to wild price swings, both good and bad, which scares away many investors from the sector. While I understand the trepidation, I think it's a mistake to simply ignore investing in biotech completely, as winning biotech stock returns can be extraordinary. 
So how can risk-averse investors add biotech exposure to their portfolio without having to take individual company risk? One easy way is to buy into an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, that owns a huge basket of biotech stocks. One such ETF that might be worthy of consideration is the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSEARCA:XBI).
Investors in this ETF have enjoyed a terrific long-term ride, as the returns since it first launched in 2006 have simply crushed the S&P 500. The annualized return since hitting the markets is currently a blistering 19.27%.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-52955');
            });
        



Of course, just because an ETF (or mutual fund, or stock) has performed well in the past doesn't necessarily mean it will perform as great going forward. To get a sense of what investors can expect from this ETF in the future, it's helpful to crack it open to how the fund operates. 
Currently, this fund holds 103 companies, which immediately offers investors great diversification. What's particularly interesting to me is that this fund uses an ""equal-weight"" strategy for sizing its investments. An equal-weight strategy simply means that all of the companies held in the fund are given the same initial weighting, regardless of the size of the company. Most other stock market indexes use a ""weighted average market capitalization"" system, in which more of the fund's money is invested in larger companies and less in smaller ones.
While I tend to like ETFs that use equal weighing, it's important for investors to understand that smaller-cap companies tend to be a bit more volatile, and that's especially true of biotech stocks, which means this ETF might be more prone to even more volatility than a weighted-average ETF would be.

A few numbers jump out at me. With an expense ratio of just 0.35%, this fund is a cheap way for investors to gain immediate diversification in the biotech sector. However, it also has a high turnover ratio of 86%, which means the fund is regularly adding and subtracting stocks, which can lead to higher taxes for shareholders -- though given the incredible performance of the fund, I doubt this has bothered most investors.
Another number to watch is that very high price-to-prospective earnings ratio of 30, which is far higher than the S&P 500's 19. However, seeing a high number shouldn't be all that surprising, especially since almost half of the companies the biotech fund holds don't even have a drug on the market yet, so profits could be a long ways away -- and this is just the nature of the industry.

One of the first questions any beginning investor asks is how to get into stocks in the first place. The answer is a lot like learning to swim. You want to get into stocks gradually and limit your risk -- dip your toes in the water and stay in the shallow end, as it were -- before trying to execute a reverse somersault dive with two and a half twists.
Let's take this one step at a time.

How do you get into stocks? Slowly -- and carefully. Image source: Getty Images.

Dip your toes in the water
Much like a beginning swimmer approaching the edge of a swimming pool, the stock market looks like a pretty scary place. At first. It's not a familiar environment. It's not a place you've been before, and you don't know quite what to expect once you first get into stocks. You don't know how to swim before you start paddling, and you probably don't know how to invest before you pick your first stock, either.
So don't.
Or rather, don't try to pick a winning stock on the very first day you start investing. Instead of trying to pick the best stocks, consider buying all the stocks at once. You can do this by buying an exchange-traded fund, better known as an ETF, that represents a stake in all 500 of the largest companies on the S&P 500 index of stocks. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO), iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:IVV), and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT:SPY) are three popular ETFs that will do this for you.
It doesn't really matter which of these ETFs you buy. Each charges a very reasonable expense ratio of less than one-tenth of 1%, guaranteeing that whether you buy the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, or SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, you will enjoy gains very similar to what the 500 companies in the S&P 500 enjoy.
Stay in the shallow end
Once you've dipped your toes in the water by buying your first ETF, just sit there for a while and get used to the sensation of being ""in the market."" Watch how the value of your investment goes up and goes down from day to day, and get yourself comfortable with the idea that investing in the stock market can cause you to lose money as well as gain money.
Perhaps you'll decide you don't like that sensation at all and want to get back out of the pool. That's fine.
But if you stay long enough, you'll discover that over time, the stock market tends to rise in value more than it falls. Eventually, you may get the urge to find out if you can pick stocks that will rise more than the average -- but again, I'd urge you to start slow.
Pick one company you really like and that you think might do better than average, and buy that one stock. Now you have a couple of things to compare. Over time, does the stock that you picked do better than the S&P 500 ETF that you bought? Or does your stock do worse than your ETF?

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-31733');
            });
        

Reverse somersault dive with two and a half twists
If the stock you picked does better than the ETF -- then hey, you just might have a knack for this stock-picking thing. You might be ready to move beyond just knowing how to invest, and be ready to begin picking a few more of the best stocks in the market. Your interest piqued, you might be ready to start discovering the differences between earnings and free cash flow, learn how to read a balance sheet, and decide whether you prefer dividend stocks or growth stocks.
Conversely, if the stock you picked does worse than the ETF (and it may take a few weeks, or months, for the difference to become obvious), then you might be better off sticking with owning broad-based index fund ETFs. Or, you might decide that you need to educate yourself a little bit more before buying your next stock. The important thing is that by this point, you will already know how to get into stocks and be able to make an informed choice about whether you want to stay there -- and exactly how deep you want to dive in.

But if you stay long enough, you'll discover that over time, the stock market tends to rise in value more than it falls. Eventually, you may get the urge to find out if you can pick stocks that will rise more than the average -- but again, I'd urge you to start slow.
Pick one company you really like and that you think might do better than average, and buy that one stock. Now you have a couple of things to compare. Over time, does the stock that you picked do better than the S&P 500 ETF that you bought? Or does your stock do worse than your ETF?

If the stock you picked does better than the ETF -- then hey, you just might have a knack for this stock-picking thing. You might be ready to move beyond just knowing how to invest, and be ready to begin picking a few more of the best stocks in the market. Your interest piqued, you might be ready to start discovering the differences between earnings and free cash flow, learn how to read a balance sheet, and decide whether you prefer dividend stocks or growth stocks.
Conversely, if the stock you picked does worse than the ETF (and it may take a few weeks, or months, for the difference to become obvious), then you might be better off sticking with owning broad-based index fund ETFs. Or, you might decide that you need to educate yourself a little bit more before buying your next stock. The important thing is that by this point, you will already know how to get into stocks and be able to make an informed choice about whether you want to stay there -- and exactly how deep you want to dive in. 
",How to Get Into Stocks
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/26/how-to-get-into-stocks.aspx,2017-05-26,"
One of the first questions any beginning investor asks is how to get into stocks in the first place. The answer is a lot like learning to swim. You want to get into stocks gradually and limit your risk -- dip your toes in the water and stay in the shallow end, as it were -- before trying to execute a reverse somersault dive with two and a half twists.
Let's take this one step at a time.

How do you get into stocks? Slowly -- and carefully. Image source: Getty Images.

Dip your toes in the water
Much like a beginning swimmer approaching the edge of a swimming pool, the stock market looks like a pretty scary place. At first. It's not a familiar environment. It's not a place you've been before, and you don't know quite what to expect once you first get into stocks. You don't know how to swim before you start paddling, and you probably don't know how to invest before you pick your first stock, either.
So don't.
Or rather, don't try to pick a winning stock on the very first day you start investing. Instead of trying to pick the best stocks, consider buying all the stocks at once. You can do this by buying an exchange-traded fund, better known as an ETF, that represents a stake in all 500 of the largest companies on the S&P 500 index of stocks. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO), iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:IVV), and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT:SPY) are three popular ETFs that will do this for you.
It doesn't really matter which of these ETFs you buy. Each charges a very reasonable expense ratio of less than one-tenth of 1%, guaranteeing that whether you buy the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, or SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, you will enjoy gains very similar to what the 500 companies in the S&P 500 enjoy.
Stay in the shallow end
Once you've dipped your toes in the water by buying your first ETF, just sit there for a while and get used to the sensation of being ""in the market."" Watch how the value of your investment goes up and goes down from day to day, and get yourself comfortable with the idea that investing in the stock market can cause you to lose money as well as gain money.
Perhaps you'll decide you don't like that sensation at all and want to get back out of the pool. That's fine.
But if you stay long enough, you'll discover that over time, the stock market tends to rise in value more than it falls. Eventually, you may get the urge to find out if you can pick stocks that will rise more than the average -- but again, I'd urge you to start slow.

The stock market remains the best way to build wealth over long periods of time, but choosing individual stocks is not for everyone. Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, can be a smart way to get stock exposure in your retirement account without paying excessive fees. With that in mind, here are three excellent ETFs that can get you started on your way to a financially comfortable retirement.
Warren Buffett's favorite investment
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has said several times that the best investment most people can make is a low-cost S&P 500 index fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO). The basic idea is that such a fund will benefit from the success of American business, and will keep the gains in your pocket, not in the pocket of a fee-seeking mutual fund manager.

ETFs can help you build wealth to create a secure retirement. Image source: Getty Images.

In fact, Buffett has advised his own wife to invest the money she inherits in a fund like this, much to the surprise of many Berkshire Hathaway investors.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, as the name implies, invests in the 500 components of the S&P 500 index, weighted proportionally. And because its expense ratio (fee) is a rock-bottom 0.04% per year, the fund has virtually matched the index's performance over time. To illustrate how low this fee is, if you were to invest $10,000 in the fund, your total expenses for the first year would be just $4.
A defensive ETF with high income
Dividend stocks tend to outperform their non-dividend counterparts during tough economic times, as they tend to be more stable and mature businesses, and the dividend helps to create a price floor as the share price drops. In addition, if you're investing for retirement, you'll eventually want to draw income from your investments.
For these reasons, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) could be a smart addition to your retirement portfolio. The fund invests in a portfolio of 412 stocks in all sectors except real estate, all of which pay higher-than-average dividend yields. As of this writing, the fund yields 2.9%, and top holdings include Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, and JPMorgan Chase. If you notice, these high-dividend stocks are among the strongest players in their respective industries.
Finally, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF charges a low expense ratio of 0.09%, so you'll get to keep most of the dividends the fund pays out.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-21054');
            });
        

Dividends and growth
Since the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF specifically excludes REITs, my third retirement ETF choice is one that specifically focuses on real estate.
The Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEMKT:SCHH) tracks a weighted index of major equity real estate investment trusts -- that is, companies that own investment properties. Its index, the Dow Jones US Select REIT Index, tracks about 120 of the largest equity REITs as of this writing. Top holdings include mall REIT Simon Property Group, self-storage REIT Public Storage, and industrial REIT Prologis.
Because of their favorable tax treatment, REITs tend to pay above-average dividends, and its current 3.1% dividend yield is the highest of the three ETFs discussed here. Additionally, REITs have the potential to produce excellent growth over time as their underlying properties grow in value. This can combine for some pretty impressive total returns. And with an expense ratio of just 0.07%, this can be an excellent way to add the benefits of real estate investing to your retirement portfolio without actually buying an investment property yourself.

",3 ETFs to Help You Build Retirement Wealth

Investors like dividends because they provide income from their stock portfolios. When interest rates are low, dividend stocks get even more popular. But it's important to look at the trends among dividend stocks in order to understand current market conditions and make more informed investment decisions. With that in mind, the following seven facts about dividends have flown under the radars of many dividend investors.
1. Dividend payments are near record levels
The past two quarters have been historic for dividend payments in the stock market. When you look at S&P 500 companies, investors received dividends at an annualized rate of more than $400 billion per year in each of the two most recent periods, with the fourth quarter of 2016 setting a new record high, according to the latest figures from Yardeni Research. That figure is more than double what the S&P 500 paid to its shareholders in dividends during the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009. The pace of growth has slowed somewhat in the past couple of years, but even so, the uptrend remains intact.

2. Dividends are more reliable than other methods of returning shareholder capital
Many companies that pay dividends also look to repurchase their shares as another way to return capital to shareholders. But dividends have been a far more dependable source of capital for shareholders, and buyback activity has grown more turbulent. For instance, in the third quarter of 2016, the amount that S&P 500 companies spent on buybacks fell to its lowest level since early 2013. As the market climbs, fewer companies are comfortable with stock repurchases, and that has made dividends more important for those seeking reliable income from their investments.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-56216');
            });
        

3. The market's dividend yield hasn't moved much
Even though total dividends paid have risen, the boom in the stock market has largely tracked those increases. As a result, dividend yields have remained relatively stable. Currently, the S&P 500 has a dividend yield of just 1.97%, a bit below the 2% mark that has served as an approximate benchmark for much of the 21st century. Until the stock market stops posting such healthy advances, it'll be tough for dividend yields to climb.
4. Payout ratios are relatively healthy
The good thing about the stock market rally is that it has largely resulted from fundamental improvement in business conditions. In particular, operating earnings have rebounded from their weakest levels in 2016, and that has helped to support dividend payments more fully. As of the first quarter of 2017, S&P 500 companies were paying out about 42% of their operating earnings to shareholders as dividends. That's still higher than the metric's best levels back in 2014, but it at least provides some assurance that earnings are moving in the right direction.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-46676');
            });
        

5. Large-cap stocks are still where to find dividends
Having a diversified portfolio is important for investors, but on the dividend front, it's hard to get the same bang for your buck from smaller stocks. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks currently has a yield of just 1.46% according to figures from Birinyi Associates, and that's less than three-quarters what you can get from the S&P 500. Smaller companies typically need more of their capital to reinvest into their operations and foster growth. Moreover, solid performance from small-cap indexes have helped send their yields down nearly a fifth of a percentage point since last year.
6. The Nasdaq continues to lag on the dividend front
For a long time, technology stocks resisted dividends. Even though that trend has largely changed, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is still a fairly unfriendly environment for income investors. The current dividend yield on the Nasdaq 100 is just 1.12%, down from 1.32% last year. That could all change if tax reform allows companies to repatriate overseas capital at a preferential tax rate, but for now, dividend investors will have to put up with subpar performance from the Nasdaq.

                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-55631');
            });
        

7. Many stocks have been boosting their dividends
Dividend increases are always popular with investors, and companies have generally been obliging. Nearly 2,600 companies gave their shareholders dividend raises between March 2016 and March 2017, according to figures from S&P Dow Jones Indices, compared to only 573 dividend decreases. That number of increases was down slightly from year-ago levels, but it still points to the strength of the economy and the willingness of companies to reward investors with dividends.
Dividends are important for investors, but it's important to understand the current state of dividends in the stock market. That way, you can make smarter investing decisions without getting blindsided by unexpected surprises.

Home prices in Portland, Oregon, are soaring.
On a monthly basis, the local newspaper catalogs homes that sold above list price. The latest installment includes 34 homes that sold for 15% to 42% over list price in April.
Portland isn't the only city that's seeing this trend. Nearly two dozen other major metropolitan areas are experiencing rising prices.
If you're looking for an explanation, look no further than the inventory of homes for sale.

Data source: Federal Reserve. Chart by author.

As a general rule, home prices rise when the number of homes for sale equals less than the previous six months' worth of actual home sales in that market. So, if there are 1,000 homes for sale in a particular city and 500 homes sell each month, the inventory is equal to two months' worth of sales.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-18680');
            });
        


The latest figure in Portland is 1.6 months, which is well below the six-month threshold. Across the country more generally, the supply of homes for sale equals 5.7 months' worth of sales.
The nationwide housing shortage isn't as acute as it is in Portland, but it's still low enough to likely fuel a continuing climb in home prices this summer.

The past few years have been rough for department stores, which once enjoyed a steady flow of foot traffic as the anchors of sprawling malls. The rise of online shopping caused mall traffic to plummet, while ""fast fashion"" retailers like H&M lured away apparel shoppers.
Department store chains like J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD), Macy's (NYSE:M), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), and Dillard's (NYSE:DDS) reacted to that shift with store closings, discounts, and e-commerce investments. But based on their comparable-store sales growth in fiscal 2016, those efforts haven't stopped the bleeding.

Data sources: Annual reports. Chart by author.

Each of these companies has offered turnaround plans. J.C. Penney is selling more home improvement items, beauty products, and athletic apparel. Sears plans to cut over a billion dollars in expenses to stay afloat. Macy's is experimenting with stores within stores, private-label products, and more discounts. Nordstrom is expanding its off-price brands, and Dillard's is relying on its relative strength in women's apparel.
Those plans haven't impressed investors. That's why all five stocks have posted double-digit declines over the past five years. Unless these companies dramatically pivot their businesses away from big brick-and-mortar stores and malls, that pain could continue for the foreseeable future.

In this segment of the Motley Fool Money radio show, host Chris Hill, Motley Fool Explorer's Simon Erickson, Supernova and Rule Breakers' David Kretzmann, and Motley Fool Pro and Options' Jeff Fischer ponder what it means when Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is posting 43% gains near the halfway point of the year, and the best return in the S&P 500 is Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) more-than-60% climb. You may or may not see the attraction to what they sell, but can you afford to miss out on their profits?



A full transcript follows the video.







This video was recorded on May 26, 2017.

Chris Hill: We're closing in on the halfway point of 2017. Two of the biggest gainers in the S&P 500 so far are in the video game industry. Shares of Electronic Arts up 43% year to date, and Activision Blizzard the No. 1 gainer in the S&P 500, the stock up more than 60%. David, is this now officially one of those industries where if you have a diversified portfolio, you need to start thinking about making room, some small room in your portfolio, for exposure to video games?
David Kretzmann: I think so. The way these companies are engaging with customers, especially with this transition to digital, it's just such a more attractive and profitable business model compared to selling the physical discs in the store. We talked about Take-Two Interactive in the first segment. They last released Grand Theft Auto V in 2013, and that still makes up over 30% of their revenue today. So, the shelf life of these games is just incredible, and the amount of money that people are spending over multiples of years is really astounding. And then you have e-sports on top of that. A lot of e-sports championship tournaments, like the League of Legends last year had 43 million viewers, which is more than Game 7 of the NBA finals, it's more than World Series. So, the level of engagement continues to tick up, but I think there's still a lot of room for this to grow globally.
Simon Erickson: Plus one for the level of engagement pun, unintended by David.
Kretzmann: I'll take it.
Erickson: Millennials are hard to advertise to. A lot of companies are trying to figure out how to advertise to this growing part of the population. But one way that you can do it is through video games. Rather than advertising on television, you have this new media, which is e-sports, which is these giant platforms where people are playing games, and it's attracting lot of millennials that are watching it, as you pointed out, David. This is a great opportunity for companies to reach that population, too.
Hill: It's interesting. In The Washington Post this week, on the front page of the sports section -- yes, I still get the physical newspaper delivered to my home.
Jeff Fischer: Me, too.
Kretzmann: Dinosaurs.
Hill: So, I can say the front page of the sports section. But, on the front page, there was a story about the University of Maryland e-sports team. Which, I had no idea there were colleges that actually had e-sports teams. And it started as a club sport, and then these students went to the athletic department and essentially asked for permission to use the University name, get branded clothing, all of these kinds of things, and now they're in some kind of tournament. You talk about advertising to millennials. When I think about dominoes to fall when it comes to e-sports, as we see with traditional college athletics, and Nike and Under Armour going to universities and saying, ""We'll pay you for your football team and your basketball team and your lacrosse team to wear our uniforms."" Is that the next step here? Are we going to see Take-Two Interactive starting to put advertising on college e-sports teams?
Kretzmann: I think that's inevitable. You're already seeing some colleges just give out scholarships, you have some colleges and high schools building e-sports stadiums where spectators can come and watch these events play out. So, I think there's a lot of room for this to grow. It's still a little hard for me to wrap my mind around. But, especially with that younger audience, you have a huge and growing global audience.
Hill: How big a stadium do you need? Can't you just put them in wherever you play basketball on campus? Do you actually need your own e-sports stadium?
Kretzmann: I suppose it depends on the game, but apparently so. You will have these packed stadiums where people come out and watch other people play video games, and it's a growing trend.
Fischer: That's crazy. I mean, I get the camaraderie of that, and the excitement, but why not just put on the VR goggles and watch it that way?
Kretzmann: Maybe in five years.

As for individual stocks, Perrigo Company plc (NYSE:PRGO) and Michael Kors Holdings (NYSE:KORS) made big moves after the companies reported earnings.
Perrigo shares some good news (for a change)
Investors in Perrigo breathed a sigh of relief when Q1 results came in above expectations, sending shares up 7.3%. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.05 compared with analysts' average estimate of $0.98. The maker of generic drugs and store-branded over-the-counter medications had seen its stock fall in the last two days in anticipation of the earnings announcement, but shares recovered to last week's level on the good results.
Turmoil at Perrigo has contributed to a stock price decline of 12.5% so far in 2017. In recent months the company announced a restructuring, the resignation of the CFO, replacement of some members of the board of directors, the divestiture of the royalty stream from its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri (with a resulting writedown of $5.4 billion), and a three-month delay in the reporting of fourth-quarter results. If all that weren't enough, the company revealed in early May that its pricing practices are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division. 
Company executives are clearly eager to get investors looking forward. In the press release, CEO John T. Hendrickson said, ""I am pleased that our consolidated first quarter 2017 top and bottom line results were consistent with our plan, with our operations continuing to deliver strong cash flow conversion. I continue to anticipate 2017 will be a year of execution to reestablish our foundation, with a projected return to consolidated growth in 2018.""
Indeed, first-quarter results may indicate the worst is behind for Perrigo, but investors are not likely to get too excited until they see signs that the restructuring is paying off, growth returns, and the DOJ issue is resolved.

Michael Kors stock continues to be unfashionable
Shares of Michael Kors Holdings plunged 8.5% after the company reported an awful fiscal fourth quarter. The luxury handbag maker's sales declined 11% year over year and Kors posted a loss of $0.17 per share, compared to a gain of $0.98 in the period a year earlier. Retail comparable-store sales declined 14% and wholesale net sales declined 23%. Openings of 159 net new stores over the past year, mostly due to acquisitions in China, kept the top line from looking even worse.
Michael Kors has had to contend with a challenging retail environment that has particularly affected luxury goods, but company officials acknowledged that some of the problems are of its own making. ""Fiscal 2017 was a challenging year, as we continued to operate in a difficult retail environment with elevated promotional levels,"" said Chairman and CEO John Idol. ""In addition, our product and store experience did not sufficiently engage and excite consumers.""
After years of challenging results, observers were not expecting much out of the quarter, but Idol made it clear that a turnaround is not coming soon. ""Looking ahead, as we expand the fashion innovation in our accessories assortments, right-size our store fleet and elevate our store experience, fiscal 2018 will be a transition year in which we establish a new baseline before returning to long-term growth,"" he said. The company announced that 100 to 125 full-price retail stores will be closed over the next two years, resulting in charges of $100 million to $125 million.

If you think it's too late to lower your 2016 tax bill, think again. Traditional IRA contributions can still be deductible for 2016, but you need to act before the tax deadline. Here's what you need to know about the traditional IRA deduction and how much it could boost your tax refund (Hint: A lot).
The traditional IRA deduction
When it comes to IRA investing, most Americans have two main options: traditional or Roth. Roth IRA contributions are not tax-deductible, but eventual withdrawals in retirement are 100% tax-free. Plus, Roth IRAs have several other important advantages.

Image Source: Getty Images.

On the other hand, if it's more immediate tax savings you're after, traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible in the year they're made. If you're not sure which option is best for you, here's a discussion that could help you decide.
However, if you choose a traditional IRA, you want to be sure that you qualify for the deduction, so let's take a look at the rules. For the 2016 and 2017 tax years, you can contribute up to $5,500 to your traditional IRA (or up to $6,500 if you're aged 50 or older), so this could potentially be a big deduction. For example, if you contribute the full $5,500 and are in the 25% tax bracket, this can translate to an extra $1,375 in your pocket at tax time.
Do you qualify?
Since the purpose of the traditional IRA deduction is to help low- to moderate-income taxpayers, as well as all workers who don't have a retirement plan at work, the ability to take the deduction is restricted for certain individuals.
If you're covered by an employer's retirement plan, your ability to take the traditional IRA deduction depends on your adjusted gross income, or AGI. Here are the IRS' AGI income limits for the 2016 and 2017 tax years. If your income is below the lower number in your range, it means you qualify for a full traditional IRA deduction. If your AGI falls within the range, you can take a partial deduction.

Now here's how it works if you're not covered by an employer's retirement plan. If you're single, there is no income limit; you're eligible to take a traditional IRA deduction regardless of how much you make. If you're married and don't have an employer's retirement plan, your traditional IRA deduction is only limited if your spouse is covered through their employer's plan.

You could still use it on your 2016 tax return
You'll notice that in the last section, I listed the income limits for 2016 and 2017. That's not because this article is outdated; you can still get the tax deduction for your 2016 tax return.
One unique aspect of the traditional IRA deduction is that you can make your contribution up to the tax filing deadline for each tax year. In other words, you can make a traditional IRA contribution designated for the 2016 tax year until the April 18, 2017 filing deadline.
If you haven't done a great job of saving for your retirement so far, this could give you a chance to catch up. After all, you can make both your 2016 and 2017 traditional IRA contributions this year, for a total tax deduction of $11,000 (or $13,000 if you're 50 or older).
It's not really a deduction at all
The best part of the traditional IRA deduction is that it's technically not a deduction at all -- rather, it's an ""adjustment to income."" This means that you can take advantage of it regardless of whether you itemize deductions. Plus, it can help you qualify for other tax benefits, as it reduces your adjusted gross income (AGI), which several other tax breaks are based on.

OK, so I'll deposit $5,500 into an IRA. Then what?
This is the most common question I get asked after I explain the traditional IRA deduction.
Fortunately, IRA investing doesn't need to be difficult. A good place to start is a low-cost index fund, such as one that tracks the S&P 500. As you learn more about the market and build up a nice ""base"" of index funds, you can add some individual stocks into the mix if you so choose.

Atwood Oceanics' buyout
Atwood Oceanics stock leaped 24% after the offshore driller agreed to be purchased by Ensco. The terms of the deal spell out a $7 billion all-stock transaction through which Atwood Oceanics shareholders will receive 1.6 shares of Ensco for each share of their company. That translates into a 33% premium for Atwood Oceanics shares over the prior closing price. However, because Ensco shares fell 5% on the news, the actual price jump was significantly less on Tuesday.

Image source: Getty Images.

In a press release, executives explained the rationale behind the move. ""The combination of Ensco and Atwood will strengthen our position as the leader in offshore drilling across a wide range of water depths around the world,"" Ensco CEO Carl Trowell said. Specifically, the acquisition bulks up the company's portfolio by adding premium jackup fleets, Trowell noted. As for the terms that management agreed to, which will leave Atwood Oceanics shareholders with 31% ownership of the combined entity, executives said ""the purchase price for these assets represents a compelling value to our shareholders.""
The two companies aim to save roughly $65 million in costs annually once the merger is completed. In the meantime, investors can expect Atwood Oceanics' share price to rise and fall with movements in Ensco's stock now that their valuations are locked together.

Multi-Color profits
Shares of premium label specialist Multi-Color gained 5% after the company posted surprisingly strong fourth-quarter earnings results. Organic growth accelerated to a 5% pace from 4% in the prior quarter, and that metric was further boosted by acquisitions that accounted for a 3% bump in sales gains. Altogether, the company's $244 million of revenue beat the consensus estimate, which was targeting $236 million.
Multi-Color managed increased profitability, too, with gross profit jumping 11% thanks to spiking volume in the core U.S. market. Gross margin improved to 22% of sales from 21.4% a year ago, and that success allowed the company to generate $0.98 per share of profit, up 40% after accounting for one-time shifts.
Executive Chairman Nigel Vinecombe chose to focus his comments on management's forecast for the coming year. ""Fiscal 2018 provides further organic revenue growth opportunities in the 3-5% range,"" he said in a press release, ""and increased acquisitions revenue opportunities with our lowest leverage in over five years.""
That aggressive outlook implies accelerating growth ahead to build on this past year's 3% expansion pace. Multi-Color appears set to ramp up its acquisition moves in fiscal 2018, too, now that debt has declined to less than three times non-GAAP adjusted earnings. These strategic purchases have bolstered its industry coverage lately while pushing margins higher. At attractive prices, further buyouts could help keep sales growth chugging along.

Investors who are intrigued by the promise of new healthcare technology to fight cancer will probably want to look at Genomic Health (NASDAQ:GHDX) stock. The provider of genomic-based diagnostic tests has set itself apart from other genomic companies with its Oncotype product line.
Is Genomic Health the kind of stock that could generate huge returns over the long run? Possibly. However, here are three things investors should know before buying Genomic Health. 

Image source: Getty Images.

1. High volatility
If you only looked at Genomic Health's beta value of 0.68, you might think the stock wasn't too volatile. In theory, that beta value means that Genomic Health stock is considerably less volatile than the overall market. But is that really the case? 
Beta values are typically calculated by comparing monthly prices of a stock against monthly prices of the S&P 500 Index. Different time periods can be used, but 36 months is common. Here's how Genomic Health stock's chart looks versus that of the S&P 500 Index.

GHDX data by YCharts.
Genomic Health stock had multiple wild swings during the period. The chart appears to show that it was a lot more volatile than the S&P 500 was. So why would Genomic Health have such a low beta value?
Perhaps the best explanation is that the monthly prices for the stock didn't have nearly as many gyrations as the above chart of daily prices reflects. Regardless, investors should be aware that Genomic Health stock is pretty volatile and be prepared for a potentially bumpy ride.  
2. High valuation
Genomic Health's shares trade at nearly 93 times expected earnings. That's a sky-high forward earnings multiple. In February, I listed Genomic Health as one of the three most wildly overvalued stocks in healthcare. Here's the kicker: the company's forward earnings multiple is higher now than it was then. 
The primary issue for Genomic Health is that it is spending a ton of money on sales and marketing. Its stock trades at only 3.18 times sales. That's actually a pretty good level. However, the company has been spending more on operations than it makes in revenue. The single biggest expense is sales and marketing.
While spending in other areas has gone down, sales and marketing costs are going up. This trend doesn't appear to be likely to change anytime soon. Genomic Health says that it expects sales and marketing expenses to increase because of its efforts to spur adoption of and reimbursement for its products, expand its global commercial infrastructure, and grow its sales force.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-28621');
            });
        

3. Wide range of growth projections
High valuations can be acceptable to investors when a stock has tremendous growth prospects. Is that the case for Genomic Health? It depends on who you ask and how they define growth.
The company maintains that it will be able to grow adjusted EBITDA from around $10 million last year to over $100 million by 2020. If that impressive growth is achieved, Genomic Health's current valuation could be justified. However, the consensus among Wall Street analysts calls for average annual earnings growth of less than 6%.
One reason behind the big discrepancy in projections is the difference between adjusted EBITDA and earnings. The former is inflated by the addition of depreciation and stock-based compensation expenses. Genomic Health spent over $18 million last year on stock-based compensation and nearly $9 million on depreciation and amortization. That's a lot of money to leave out of the equation.
Why the stock could still be a buy
Despite all of this, Genomic Health could still be a stock for long-term investors. A sizable potential market exists for the company's products. For example, Genomic Health's Oncotype DX for breast cancer has a 55% U.S. market share and has penetrated only 10% of the potential international market. Its Oncotype DX for prostate cancer has penetrated 10% of the U.S. market.
The company should be able to secure reimbursement for its products in more European countries in the next year or so. In addition, Genomic Health's Oncotype SEQ liquid biopsy is especially promising.
I expect the financial results for Genomic Health will improve significantly in the coming years. Will the company grow enough to justify its current valuation? It remains to be seen. But for investors who aren't too risk-averse and are willing to hang on through ups and downs, Genomic Health stock could be one to consider.

I read that Apple has $256.8 billion in cash. Wouldn't it be better to use that money to expand its business or pay shareholders a dividend?
Ideally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would use its cash hoard to make acquisitions that add value to the company. As my Foolish colleague Adam Levy recently pointed out, Apple could easily buy a major media outlet such as Time Warner or Viacom, a content-distribution platform like Netflix, and a music-streaming company like SiriusXM or Pandora, and still have cash left over to give its shareholders a big one-time dividend payment. I'm not saying that any of these would necessarily be in the best interests of Apple investors, but the point is that the company could do it.
The problem is where Apple's cash is. The vast majority of Apple's cash stockpile -- 94% at the end of 2016 -- is held overseas. If it were to bring the cash back to the U.S. to put to work, it would need to pay hefty repatriation taxes on the money. The corporate tax rate is currently 35%, so we're talking about over $80 billion in taxes just to bring the company's money home.
President Donald Trump, as well as Republican leaders in Congress, have expressed support for a repatriation tax holiday with a one-time rate of 10%. A similar tax holiday was enacted in 2004, and could potentially save Apple about $60 billion.
The bottom line is that if a repatriation holiday takes place, it's a safe bet that Apple won't be sitting on a quarter-trillion-dollar mountain of cash for much longer. Until then, however, Apple feels that repatriation of its foreign profits simply isn't in the company's best interest.

What happened?Like crude oil, the prices for many other commodities have been falling conspicuously. And like oil companies, miners of those goods have been feeling the pinch. It's the same story with global mining concern Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), which, in the latest of a series of headaches, has been placed on CreditWatch Negative by Standard & Poor's.
CreditWatch Negative is a designation that a company is on ""special surveillance"" by the rating agency, with the ""negative"" qualifier meaning its current rating is at risk of being lowered.
In the press release announcing its move, Standard & Poor's said that, ""[u]nder various scenarios, we now forecast Rio Tinto's funds from operations (FFO) to debt could fall to 30%-35% over 2016-2017, slightly below the 35% threshold commensurate with the existing rating."" At the moment, Rio Tinto's long- and short-term debt is rated A- and A-2, respectively.

Does it matter?Like the oil business, the general commodities space is just not the place to be just now. Miners like Rio Tinto are trying to cope with serious price declines in the goods they extract from the earth, and sell. At least Rio Tinto's in good company; the world's largest miner, BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP), just had its credit rating cut by S&P -- to A from A+.
Rio Tinto hasn't yet gotten the chop, but being placed in the awful-sounding CreditWatch Negative category is a new headache the company just doesn't need. Its share price is down by nearly 45% during the past year, compared to the 9% drop of the S&P 500. In January, it froze salaries at all levels of the company for the remainder of the year; and in the first six months of 2015, it saw a year-over-year revenue drop of 26%, and a scary 81% decline in net profit.

            });
        


The prices of the metals that Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, and their ilk, specialize in have been pounded mercilessly, and it doesn't seem as if relief is in sight. So we can consider S&P's notification of Rio Tinto's new ""special"" status to be a harbinger of an actual ratings cut.
Rio Tinto will likely join BHP Billiton soon as a miner with a shaved rating. This will negatively affect the company's finances, which will likely knock more value off its stock.

Financial stocks led all sectors in trading volume, and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) beat the broader market with a 0.8% increase. A decline in gold prices, meanwhile, helped push the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEMKT:GDX) down 2.3%.
As for individual stocks, Bunge (NYSE:BG) and AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) saw heavy trading following market-moving news.

Bunge is a takeover candidate
Bunge shares shot up nearly 17% after the company was identified as an acquisition candidate. The grain and oilseed trader has been approached by commodities giant Glencore for a buyout, according to The Wall Street Journal. No pricing was listed in the report, which noted that a merger would quickly grant Glencore a major presence in the U.S. agriculture market.
As for Bunge, a buyout could take pressure off its agribusiness segment to quickly return to profit growth. That division is suffering from a chronic lack of product lately, especially grains, as farmers hold on to inventory in response to weak commodity prices.

Image source: Getty Images.

""The slow pace of farmer selling in South America compressed margins in Agribusiness and led to a lower than expected first quarter,"" CEO Soren Schroder told investors in early May after the company posted a sharp dive in net income as its grain business shrank to $17 million from $144 million in the prior-year period.
Schroder and his team still think Bunge will rebound to show growth for the full year because farms are reaching their holding capacities even as producers have generated record bean and corn crops that have yet to hit the market. That optimistic outlook will likely give the company leverage to seek a significant premium in any negotiations with merger candidates.

AutoZone takes a step backwards
AutoZone was the single worst performer in the S&P 500 today. Shares of the auto parts retailer fell almost 12% after the company announced surprisingly weak fiscal third-quarter results showing comparable-store sales growth decelerating for the second straight quarter. Comps shrank 0.8% compared to the prior quarter's flat result.
Thanks to the revenue pressure, AutoZone's earnings expanded by 6.2% to mark only the second time in 11 years in which earnings per share didn't rise by double digits. Management wasn't thrilled with that result. ""Our sales performance for the first five weeks of our quarter was significantly below our expectations,"" CEO Bill Rhodes said in a press release, and mentioned that the quarter's earliest days were impacted by delays in IRS tax refunds. ""The last seven weeks of sales demonstrated improvement, but not enough to make up for our soft start,"" he added.
With comps basically flat over the past nine months, compared to a 3% boost in the prior-year period, AutoZone's stellar growth streak is at risk of stalling this year. Some of that slump can be pinned on things outside of management's control, like weak industry dynamics and the tax refund delays.
Yet the business is also facing spiking competition from online-focused rivals, which presents a different type of challenge. AutoZone's e-commerce segment makes up a small portion of its operations, and that channel isn't showing robust growth right now, which means it may be losing ground to online specialists.

Financial stocks led the market in trading volumes, and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) mimicked the broader market's flat result. Gold prices rose by nearly a full percentage point to help push the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEMKT:GDX) up 1%.
As for individual stocks, Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) saw heavy trading following the companies' quarterly earnings announcements.

Deckers Outdoor boosts profits
Deckers Outdoor stock jumped nearly 19% after the footwear specialist posted surprisingly strong results for its fiscal fourth quarter. The top- and bottom-line figures weren't especially impressive, with revenue falling 2.4% and adjusted earnings holding steady at $0.11 per share.

But the sales figure easily beat management's February forecast that predicted a drop of as much as 6%. The profit result also outpaced consensus estimates looking for a loss of $0.06 per share, due to a mix of cost cuts and improved pricing trends. ""I am proud of the work the team has accomplished"" in improving profitability, CEO Dave Powers said in a press release.
Gross profit margin jumped to 43% of sales from 40.9% as Deckers scaled back on its promotions. Its core brands -- including UGG, Teva, and Sanuk -- all experienced volume declines.
Powers and his team see room to cut $150 million out of its cost infrastructure over the next three fiscal years. The retailer might benefit from a sales turnaround, too, given that executives forecast modest revenue gains for the current quarter. The improving operating and financial trends could give executives added leverage in any buyout negotiations they conduct as they look for ways to maximize shareholder returns.

GameStop returns to growth
Shares of specialty retailer GameStop slipped 6% after the company announced fiscal first-quarter earnings in which sales growth returned amid declining profits. The revenue rebound came courtesy of healthy demand for new gaming consoles that offset declines in its software segment. GameStop also benefited from increases in its consumer products and collectibles divisions, two areas it sees as critical to its plan to diversify away from the shrinking market for physical video game discs. ""Our first quarter results reflect the power of our leadership position within the video game market and our ongoing diversification efforts,"" CEO Paul Raines said in a press release.
The retailer still sees its comparable-store sales ranging between flat and a 5% decline in 2017 as earnings fall for the second straight year. Its nearly 7% dividend yield remains well covered both by earnings and cash flow. However, Wall Street chose to focus instead on GameStop's uncertain revenue outlook in an era of weakening customer traffic trends among major retailers.
Investors who are comfortable with that elevated risk might find the stock attractive given that it comes with one of the market's biggest dividend yields. GameStop is likely to post another year of declining top- and bottom-line numbers in 2017, but its results don't indicate the type of collapsing business that its valuation of just six times earnings would imply.

Investors can chase the latest trends and find success with investing, but if you're looking for reliable businesses capable of paying shareholders over a long period of time, then often it's best to look at reliable businesses that have paid shareholders over a long period of time. 
That's why three of our contributors think Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), and PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) are good places to start for investors looking for a steady stream of income.

Literally brick and mortar
Dylan Lewis (Lowe's): With all the discussion around the death of retail, it may be surprising to see a brick-and-mortar company that literally sells bricks and mortar on this list.
The reality is many consider the home improvement chain to be ""e-commerce-proof,"" as customers tend to come to the store looking for bulky specialty items, and often need assistance from in-store experts that have years of experience in DIY work.  
That, plus the company's status as a dividend aristocrat, should ease any worries investors have about buying a retail giant. 
Lowe's offers investors a reliable base business, with some interesting growth opportunities. Management is guiding to add 10-20 stores per year to the company's existing 2,400 store footprint and expects low single-digit same store sales growth. With that modest growth profile, the company trades more or less in line with the market, at 25 times trailing earnings.
But right now roughly 90% of the company's revenue comes from the United States. If management's plans to double business in Mexico bear fruit, it could provide the business (and investors) a nice little bump. 
Even so, the company's top line keeps marching along, fueling the stock's 1.7% yield. Right now, Lowe's is only paying out about 40% of earnings with its dividend payments, proving there's plenty of room for the company to continue the aggressive annual increases investors have enjoyed over the past few years. 
A go-to for growth
Keith Noonan (PepsiCo): Food and beverage giant PepsiCo has built a reputation for being a go-to choice for income-focused investors, and it's not hard to see why. The stock has reliably outperformed the market when dividend disbursements are accounted for, packs a terrific track record of payout growth, and, most importantly, it's backed by a great business that has the potential to continue enriching shareholders for many years to come.
Few companies can lay claim to a better history of returning income to shareholders than Pepsi, and continued dividend growth looks to be a safe bet. The company has increased its payout for 44 years running and is set to deliver its 45th annual dividend increase this June; that's a stretch that includes six U.S. recessions and points to the likelihood of reliable payout growth even when the broader economy hits a rough patch.
The company's 2.8% yield already sits comfortably above the S&P 500's yield of roughly 1.9%, and, with the annualized cost of distributing its current dividend representing roughly 67% of trailing free cash flow and the company's significant long-term earnings growth potential, there's still room for payout increases. 
With a forward P/E of 22, PepsiCo looks like a reasonably priced investment that's poised to live up its reputation as a great dividend stock to hold for the long term.

M-m-mmm good dividends
Rich Duprey (Campbell Soup): Soup maker Campbell Soup is colder than a bowl of gazpacho these days, but its annual dividend of $1.40 per share that currently yields 2.4% still gives investors with a hearty appetite to dine on its stock.
The prepared foods company has come under pressure from changing consumer tastes. Like so many other industries reacting to how consumers shop, Campbell's has felt the pinch as shoppers gravitate toward fresher, healthier foods and avoid the center aisles of the grocery store.
To meet the challenge, Campbell created a fresh foods division two years ago, but it was hit last year by quality issues in its carrot business and had a recall at its Bolthouse beverages unit. It is now cycling through those problems and next year it is looking forward to greater growth, particularly as it offers up some innovations, like premium juices, different colored carrots, and bagged carrots with seasonings, which it is now selling into school systems instead of at grocery stores.
The company is also on track to exceed its $300 million cost-cutting plan a year early. While it noted it had a slow start to the year, business picked back up in March and April, and it ended up growing or maintaining market share in 11 different categories, which represents three quarters of its U.S. retail dollar sales.
Campbell Soup stock is down 15% from recent highs and  trades at 18 times next year's earnings estimates. Investors can view its shares as a bit of comfort food and collect the dividend as they wait for the soup maker to get back on track to steaming growth.

",3 Dividend Stocks for Long-Term Investors
http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/05/26/ask-a-fool-is-shorting-a-stock-a-good-idea.aspx,2017-05-26,"
Q: I have a negative opinion of Snap as an investment. Should I short the stock?
Selling a stock short or ""shorting"" the stock is certainly a way to bet against a company's success. I generally advise most investors to avoid shorting, but if you do decide to short a stock, here's what you need to know first.
When you short sell a stock, you're borrowing the shares from your brokerage, and selling them on the open market at today's price. The idea is that when the stock goes down, you can buy the shares back later for a lower price, give them back to your broker, and pocket the difference.
As an example, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) trades for about $22 as I write this. If you were to short sell 100 shares of Snap for $2,200, and the stock falls to $15, you can buy those 100 shares back for $1,500, and the $700 difference is your profit. Sounds good, right?
However, the risk with shorting a stock is the unlimited loss potential. If you short a stock and it goes up, there's no limit to how high it can go. At some point, you'll need to buy back the shares you borrowed from your broker. In our previous example, let's say that Snap has a blowout quarter and the price shoots up to $50. You're now on the hook for buying 100 shares for $5,000. If the stock continues to skyrocket to $100, you'll need to come up with $10,000 to close out the trade, which would translate to a loss of $7,800.
The bottom line is that if you do short a stock, you need to have a predetermined exit strategy in mind -- specifically, a point where you admit you were wrong and take a loss if the trade doesn't go your way.

",Ask a Fool: Is Shorting a Stock a Good Idea?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/27/3-dividend-stocks-that-thrive-in-market-crashes.aspx,2017-05-27,"
No one likes market crashes. Even the best stocks often get swept up in the panic. Whether a market crash is on the horizon is unpredictable, but investors can position themselves defensively by owning quality dividend stocks that hold up better than most when things take a turn for the worse. Here's why Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Clorox (NYSE:CLX), and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) are good bets for risk-averse investors.
Necessary products
Brian Stoffel (Johnson & Johnson): I'm not sure if there's such a thing as a recession-proof dividend stock, but Johnson & Johnson is surely a recession-resistant one. The company has three divisions: consumer products like Band-Aids and Tylenol, medical equipment, and pharmaceuticals.

Image source: Johnson & Johnson.

If you sit back and think about it, while people or hospitals may cut back on spending when the economy falters or the market crashes, they surely won't give up such purchases altogether. That's because they're vital no matter the economic climate.
Indeed, between 2008 and 2010, overall company sales fell just 3.4%. That helps explain how the company's stock outperformed the S&P 500 by 22 percentage points from January 2008 to the depths of the stock market's crash.
Not only that, but reinvested dividends from the swoon were worth even more. By March 2009, the company's yield rose to 4.1% That's the beauty of solid dividend stocks in market crashes: If they don't dive, you're happy to preserve your capital; if they do dive, just remind yourself that your reinvested dividends will be worth even more in the future.
If a market crash occurred today, investors could laugh it off. Johnson & Johnson's dividend is very safe, with only 61% of free cash flow being used to pay it over the past 12 months. Given the other dynamics covered above, that makes it a great holding for the risk-averse to consider.
Battle-tested brands
Tim Green (Clorox): A company that sells products with strong brands that people need to buy is often a good bet in the event of a market crash. Clorox, known for its namesake bleach as well as Glad trash bags and cling wrap, Brita water filters, and Liquid Plumr, barely felt the last great market crash in 2008. The stock dropped a bit, but it remained relatively unscathed compared to the broader market.

CLX data by YCharts
Clorox is not a cheap stock, and the company isn't growing very fast, as I pointed out last month. The dividend yield of around 2.6% is higher than that of the S&P 500 Index, but dividend growth will almost certainly be sluggish going forward.
That doesn't mean that Clorox isn't a solid company, though. Despite competition from cheaper store-brand alternatives, the company didn't miss a beat during the financial crisis, with revenue growing and margins feeling little pressure. A combination of good products and some great brands prevented consumers from switching away from Clorox's products.
I wouldn't expect great returns from Clorox stock going forward, considering its valuation and minimal growth prospects. But if you want something stable and unlikely to fall apart when the stock market or the economy turns south, Clorox is a pretty good choice.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-99509');
            });
        

Beating the market with science
Cory Renauer (Amgen): Investors looking for crash-resistant dividend stocks should consider this blue-chip biotech. While stocks in this industry aren't generally famous for steady dividend growth, Amgen has hiked its payout regularly since it began making them in 2011. Those hikes have been substantial as well, rising at a 48.2% annual rate over the past five years.
Although Amgen wasn't paying a dividend during the last big market crash, it's performance during the Great Recession was outstanding. Between the beginnings of 2008 and 2009, the biotech stock rose 23.9% while the benchmark SPDR S&P 500 ETF fell 37.7%.
It isn't every year that this purveyor of pricey biologic drugs beats the broader market by more than 60 percentage points, but Amgen has continued to outperform the market from the beginning of 2009 through the present.
Looking into the company's recent performance, and development pipeline, there could be more market-beating gains and dividend growth ahead. Although first-quarter revenue came in 1% lower than the year-ago period, cost-cutting and stock buybacks allowed adjusted earnings to rise 9% to $3.15 per share. The company also recently announced clinical trial results that show its experimental therapy, erenumab, significantly reduces monthly migraine headaches.
At recent prices, the stock offers a nice 2.9% yield that you can reasonably expect to continue growing. The company generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter but used just $847 million to make dividend payments during the three-month period. If approved, erenumab could generate more than $2 billion in annual sales at its peak, which, when combined with leaner operations, could give Amgen plenty more cash to continue raising payments -- even if the broader market tanks.

",3 Dividend Stocks That Thrive in Market Crashes
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/26/why-lions-gate-entertainment-nutanix-and-amtrust-f.aspx,2017-05-26,"
Friday was a quiet end to a strong week for the stock market. Major benchmarks finished very close to the unchanged level, leaving the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all either at or near record highs. Rising tensions on the geopolitical front as a result of the G7 summit in Sicily failed to translate into downward pressure on stocks, and most market participants appear to be optimistic about the prospects for continued outperformance from the U.S. economy. Even in a calm trading session, some stocks were quite strong, and Lions Gate Entertainment (NYSE:LGF-A) (NYSE:LGF-B), Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), and AmTrust Financial Services (NASDAQ:AFSI) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Lions Gate roars ahead
Shares of Lions Gate Entertainment were up 9% after the entertainment studio reported its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results late Thursday. Revenue soared by almost 60% because of the acquisition of premium cable channel operator Starz, and even when you run pro forma numbers based on year-ago results from the two companies separately, adjusted operating income climbed by more than a quarter over the past 12 months. The surprise success of blockbuster La La Land helped to drive much of the performance, but Lions Gate is even happier with the way that it has integrated Starz into its overall operational mix. With the television group posting record revenue, and plenty of promising opportunities ahead, Lions Gate hopes that this is just the beginning of a new upsurge that could take the content producer to the next level in the industry.

Nutanix climbs into the clouds
Nutanix stock rose 11.5% in the wake of the company's release of its fiscal third-quarter financial report. The enterprise cloud-computing specialist said that revenue jumped by two-thirds from year-ago levels, and although the company posted a wider net loss than it did in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, investors nevertheless were pleased that there wasn't even more red ink from Nutanix. CEO Dheeraj Pandey noted that the results ""reflect our continued focus on the Global 2000 [list of large businesses] as well as a measurable improvement in the number of larger deals in the quarter, particularly in North America."" With ongoing enterprise demand for cloud-computing services showing no signs of letting up, Nutanix should be able to use its positive momentum to capture future growth as well.

AmTrust Financial gets a vote of confidence
Finally, shares of AmTrust Financial Services finished higher by 12.5%. The beleaguered insurance company got an infusion of cash from family members of certain corporate insiders, including CEO Barry Zyskind and board member George Karfunkel. The private placement involved the sale of 24.1 million shares of stock at $12.45 per share, bringing in $300 million. Shareholders took the move as a vote of confidence in the company's future prospects, despite controversy surrounding the company and its practices. Today's jump makes the Zyskind and Karfunkel families big winners, giving them more than $36 million in profits in a single day on their newest purchases.

As for individual stocks, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Amerco (NASDAQ:UHAL) saw heavy trading following the companies' quarterly earnings announcements.
Best Buy predicts improving sales trends
Best Buy shares soared 21.5% after the electronics retailer paired solid first-quarter results with an optimistic full-year business outlook. Comparable-store sales rose 1.6% to kick off fiscal 2018, reversing the slight decline from the prior-year period. Best Buy managed comparable-sales increases in its consumer electronics, entertainment, and appliances divisions that helped offset a slight decline in its computer and smartphone segment. The online channel contributed healthy gains too, rising 22.5%.
Profit margin ticked higher thanks to solid demand across most of Best Buy's product categories. ""We are pleased today to report strong top and bottom line results,"" Chairman and CEO Hubert Joly said in a press release. ""Our Q1 performance reflects the strength of our customer value proposition and continued momentum in the execution of our strategy,"" he continued.

Executives believe the momentum will carry on into the fiscal second quarter, where sales are expected to grow 1.5% to 2.5%. Non-GAAP earnings will rise to $0.57 to $0.62 per share, which is in line with Wall Street targets. Thanks to the surprisingly strong start to the year, Joly and his team raised their full-year outlook to target 2.5% revenue gains, compared to the prior forecast of a 1.5% uptick.

Amerco takes a big earnings charge
Shares of Amerco, the parent company of U-Haul, dropped 10% after the company posted a sharp drop in fourth-quarter profits. The moving equipment specialist announced healthy demand for do-it-yourself rental trucks and for its self-storage products, as equipment rentals rose 2.3% and storage sales improved 14%. However, a spike in depreciation charges sent net income lower by 82% to just $9.5 million. For the full year, earnings fell to $742 million from $867 million.
Amerco's results were hurt by a broad decline in value for used vehicles that's causing both higher depreciation charges and lower recovery prices when the company sells its older models to make room for fleet improvements. That trend was especially pronounced this year, as Amerco placed 42,000 new trucks in service. ""Increased truck depreciation and reduction in gain on sale of trucks are big drivers of the earnings drop for the year,"" Chairman and CEO Joe Shoen explained in a press release.
Shoen and his team are focused on boosting revenue through increased rental volumes, higher average prices, and increased utilization of its equipment. Its capital charges, meanwhile, should decline in the year ahead as fleet investments fall from $705 million in fiscal 2017 to $440 million in fiscal 2018. The company is still likely to endure increased depreciation costs that pinched reported profits this year, though.

Intuit raises expectations
Intuit shares advanced 7% to a new high after the software giant posted surprisingly strong fiscal third-quarter earnings numbers and raised its 2017 outlook. Revenue jumped 10% during the critical tax season period as the company achieved its market share goals while expanding its base of self-employed customers using its QuickBooks products. ""This was another strong quarter for Intuit, with a hard-fought tax season delivering the revenue we promised along with continued momentum in our QuickBooks franchise,"" Chairman and CEO Brad Smith said in a press release.

Operating profit improved due to the rising proportion of high-margin subscription sales. That boost allowed the company to post $3.90 per share of adjusted earnings to edge past consensus estimates that were calling for $3.87 per share.
Smith and his executive team increased their guidance for the full fiscal year that ends in July. Revenue is now expected to rise by as much as 10% to between $5.13 billion and $5.15 billion. Intuit's prior forecast had targeted a range of $5 billion to $5.1 billion. The profit outlook is brightening, too, with operating income expected to be between $1.36 billion and $1.38 billion, up from the prior range of $1.33 billion to $1.38 billion.

Tiffany's slow start to the year
Tiffany stock fell 9% following the release of the luxury retailer's quarterly results, which showed its continuing struggle with returning to sales growth. Comparable-store sales fell 4% in the key U.S. region thanks to declining demand from both foreign tourists and local shoppers. Tiffany endured minor comps drops in each of its other geographic regions (Europe, Japan, and Asia-Pacific). On the bright side, gross profit margin improved by nearly a full percentage point to 62% of sales thanks to falling raw material costs and increased demand for premium jewelry products.
Executives were satisfied with the broader trends, even as they hope to improve on them in the coming quarters. ""While these results modestly exceeded our near-term expectations,"" Chairman and interim CEO Michael Kowalski said in a press release, ""we are focused on executing long-term strategies to achieve stronger and sustainable performance through product introductions, optimization of our store base, effective marketing communications and the delivery of experiences that resonate with our customers.""
Management affirmed its outlook for low-single-digit sales growth in 2017, which would mark the company's first expansion since 2014. Falling expenses and costs should help earnings rise at a faster pace so that it improves on last year's $3.55 by nearly 10%.
That result would produce Tiffany's biggest annual profit on record. However, with the first quarter kicking 2017 off with sales declines, the stakes are rising for the retailer to outperform during the upcoming holiday season.
",What Happened in the Stock Market Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/29/better-buy-cvs-health-corporation-vs-kroger.aspx,2017-05-29,"
Are you looking for value in today's market? If so then CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) should be on your watchlist. Both companies have developed winning business models and offer up solid growth prospects, yet both companies trade at a discount to the S&P 500.
So which of these two industry giants is the better buy today? Let's look at the bull case for owning each to see if we can find an answer.
The case for CVS Health
Investors get two businesses in one when they buy CVS Health. The company is America's second-largest retail pharmacy chain and second-largest pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM.
In the PBM business, CVS acts as a middleman between drugmakers and employers, governments, unions, and other prescription drug buyers. CVS uses its scale to negotiate hefty discounts on drugs and then passes along the savings to its members. With a 97% customer retention rate, it is clear that this business creates a lot of value for its customers. 
On the retail side, CVS operates more than 9,600 retail pharmacies in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Brazil. Beyond offering basic pharmacy services, these stores also sell convenience items and in many cases offer basic healthcare services through the company's MinuteClinic network. With the number of citizens aged 65 and over expected to nearly double over the next few decades, both of these businesses have a great tailwind behind them that should drive long-term profit growth.

Image source: CVS Health.

Despite these positives, CVS Health's stock has been cast aside of late. Last year investors learned that the company's archnemesis, Walgreen Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), managed to lure away two big customers. The loss is expected to steal roughly 40 million prescriptions this year alone, which is having an impact on the company's growth prospects. More recently investors learned that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is taking a hard look at the pharmacy business, which, if true, could put this company's profits under more pressure in the future.
Thankfully, management still believes that the company is capable of putting up earnings-per-share growth in excess of 10% per year over the long term in spite of these headwinds. That's an attractive growth rate for a company that is only trading for 12 times next year's profit estimates and pays out a strong dividend that is currently yielding 2.6%
The case for Kroger
While the supermarket industry is recession-proof, it is so mature and brutally competitive that most grocery stores are hardly growing at all. However, industry giant Kroger isn't your average grocer. This company has gobbled up a number of winning regional chains over the years, which has kept its top line in growth mode. If you've ever shopped at a Roundy's, Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, Ralphs, Murray's Cheese, or King Soopers, then you are actually a Kroger customer even if you didn't know it.
Beyond acquisitions, Kroger's has also rolled out a number of growth initiatives in an effort to keep its profits flowing. These include adding fuel stations, making a big push into organics, adding self-checkout kiosks, and investing in its digital capabilities to more effectively target new shoppers. When combined, these efforts have resulted in 12 consecutive years of market-share gains and flourishing financial statements. With Kroger's headline numbers heading in the right direction, management has been able to use its excess profits to reward investors.

Looking ahead, management believes that it can keep delivering EPS growth in excess of 8% per year and raise its dividend annually by continuing to execute against its simple business plan. With shares trading for less than 13 times forward earnings and offering up a dividend yield of 1.6%, Kroger's stock could certainly be in value territory.

The better buy
While I firmly believe that investors will do well by investing in either one of these high-quality businesses right now, my gut tells me that Kroger is the better buy. The company's stock has outperformed both CVS Health and the S&P 500 over the past five years, which I like to see since I'm a believer that winners tend to keep on winning. In addition, we still can't fully quantify just how serious a threat Amazon could be to CVS Health's long-term future. Those two factors make Kroger my favorite choice for new money between these two terrific options.

Are you looking for value in today's market? If so then CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) should be on your watchlist. Both companies have developed winning business models and offer up solid growth prospects, yet both companies trade at a discount to the S&P 500.
So which of these two industry giants is the better buy today? Let's look at the bull case for owning each to see if we can find an answer.
The case for CVS Health
Investors get two businesses in one when they buy CVS Health. The company is America's second-largest retail pharmacy chain and second-largest pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM.
In the PBM business, CVS acts as a middleman between drugmakers and employers, governments, unions, and other prescription drug buyers. CVS uses its scale to negotiate hefty discounts on drugs and then passes along the savings to its members. With a 97% customer retention rate, it is clear that this business creates a lot of value for its customers. 
On the retail side, CVS operates more than 9,600 retail pharmacies in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Brazil. Beyond offering basic pharmacy services, these stores also sell convenience items and in many cases offer basic healthcare services through the company's MinuteClinic network. With the number of citizens aged 65 and over expected to nearly double over the next few decades, both of these businesses have a great tailwind behind them that should drive long-term profit growth.

Despite these positives, CVS Health's stock has been cast aside of late. Last year investors learned that the company's archnemesis, Walgreen Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), managed to lure away two big customers. The loss is expected to steal roughly 40 million prescriptions this year alone, which is having an impact on the company's growth prospects. More recently investors learned that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is taking a hard look at the pharmacy business, which, if true, could put this company's profits under more pressure in the future.
Thankfully, management still believes that the company is capable of putting up earnings-per-share growth in excess of 10% per year over the long term in spite of these headwinds. That's an attractive growth rate for a company that is only trading for 12 times next year's profit estimates and pays out a strong dividend that is currently yielding 2.6%
The case for Kroger
While the supermarket industry is recession-proof, it is so mature and brutally competitive that most grocery stores are hardly growing at all. However, industry giant Kroger isn't your average grocer. This company has gobbled up a number of winning regional chains over the years, which has kept its top line in growth mode.

The past few years have been rough for department stores, which once enjoyed a steady flow of foot traffic as the anchors of sprawling malls. The rise of online shopping caused mall traffic to plummet, while ""fast fashion"" retailers like H&M lured away apparel shoppers.
Department store chains like J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD), Macy's (NYSE:M), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), and Dillard's (NYSE:DDS) reacted to that shift with store closings, discounts, and e-commerce investments. But based on their comparable-store sales growth in fiscal 2016, those efforts haven't stopped the bleeding.

Data sources: Annual reports. Chart by author.

Each of these companies has offered turnaround plans. J.C. Penney is selling more home improvement items, beauty products, and athletic apparel. Sears plans to cut over a billion dollars in expenses to stay afloat. Macy's is experimenting with stores within stores, private-label products, and more discounts. Nordstrom is expanding its off-price brands, and Dillard's is relying on its relative strength in women's apparel.
Those plans haven't impressed investors. That's why all five stocks have posted double-digit declines over the past five years. Unless these companies dramatically pivot their businesses away from big brick-and-mortar stores and malls, that pain could continue for the foreseeable future.

The stock market performed well on Wednesday, as the S&P 500 rose to a record high and other major benchmarks also posted solid gains of between a third and a half of a percent. The Federal Reserve captured most of the attention of investors today, with the release of its latest policy committee minutes suggesting how it intends to reduce the size of its balance sheet over time. Most market participants seemed pleased with the idea that artificial support of the economy was no longer needed, and that helped set a positive tone on Wall Street. Yet some companies had bad news to report, and Dycom Industries (NYSE:DY), Chico's FAS (NYSE:CHS), and Bristow Group (NYSE:BRS) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Dycom deals with disappointment
Shares of Dycom Industries dropped 18% even though it reported solid fiscal third-quarter financial results. The telecommunications infrastructure specialist said that its revenue climbed 18% from year-ago levels, resulting in a 20% jump in adjusted earnings. Yet some investors weren't pleased that the pace of the company's organic growth slowed to its worst level in nearly two years, and forecasts for the coming quarter were substantially lower than those following the stock had expected to see. Given expected demand for telecom infrastructure services as major network carriers work on rolling out updated wireless networks, Dycom's fundamental business seems sound, and if that's the case, then today's decline might eventually prove to be a head-fake for long-term investors in the company.

Chico's hits a multiyear low
Chico's stock finished the day down 11% after the women's clothing and accessories retailer released its first-quarter earnings report. Sales fell more than 9% on an 8.7% drop in comparable sales, with widespread weakness throughout its operations. Chico's is hardly the only retailer that's facing difficult conditions right now, but the extent to which the company is seeing its business deteriorate has sent the stock to its worst levels in nearly seven years. With the company expecting mid-single-digit percentage declines in comps for the entire 2017 fiscal year, Chico's investors will have to get used to sluggish conditions for the foreseeable future.

            });
        

Bristow has a hard landing
Finally, shares Bristow Group plunged more than 35%. The helicopter services specialist suffered a more dramatic loss than expected as sales fell 14% from year-ago levels, and Bristow projected that conditions in fiscal 2018 are unlikely to improve markedly from the current slump. The main problem is that Bristow relies on extensive levels of activity in the offshore drilling industry, and with crude oil prices remaining at relatively low levels, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies simply aren't doing as much high-cost exploratory activity in the offshore realm. Until the energy industry bounces back more extensively, it'll be hard for Bristow to regain even a portion of the nearly 90% it has lost since mid-2014.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett doesn't think his wife should invest in Berkshire stock after he's gone, which may come as a surprise given Berkshire's track record and Buffett's own optimism for the company after he's gone. Charlie Munger, Buffett's right-hand man, disagrees. He thinks Berkshire will put his heirs in the best position to grow their inheritance going forward.
Why do they disagree, and who is right?
Warren Buffett wants his wife to keep it simple
Warren Buffett has said several times that the best investment most people can make is in a low-cost S&P 500 index fund, and he even bet $500,000 that such a fund would beat a portfolio of hedge funds over a decade, a bet he handily won.

Image source: The Motley Fool.

However, at Berkshire's recent annual meeting, Buffett was asked why he advised his own wife to invest in index funds after his death, as opposed to Berkshire shares. It's a good question -- after all, Buffett has said many times that he feels Berkshire will continue to outperform the market over long time periods. So why wouldn't he want his wife to benefit from that?
Buffett responded that his wife won't need to beat the market. ""She's going to have more money than she needs,"" Buffett replied. He went on to say that index funds are the best investment for people who don't want to worry about their investments. He also noted that every single one of his own Berkshire shares is going to be given to charity, so that's why his wife won't inherit any of his stock.
Basically, Buffett feels that most people, his wife included, do not have the time, desire, and/or knowledge required to efficiently choose their own stocks. And he believes that actively managed investment funds, particularly hedge funds, are more likely to underperform the market than beat it. By advising his wife to invest in index funds and leave them alone, he feels he's protecting her from those who don't necessarily have her best interests at heart.
Charlie Munger thinks Berkshire still has plenty of good years ahead
Buffett's right-hand man disagrees. Munger wants his heirs to hold on to their Berkshire shares, as he wants them to profit from what he perceives as the higher upside potential they would get from Berkshire.
It's easy to understand why he feels this way. Berkshire has more than 60 businesses that generate tons of cash, and Berkshire's team (not just Buffett and Munger) has proved its ability to identify value-adding acquisitions and stock investments that Berkshire can purchase for less than their intrinsic value. Combined with the fact that Berkshire maintains a rock-solid balance sheet and doesn't expose itself to virtually any long-term risk factors, and it's tough to imagine that Berkshire won't enjoy decades of strong performance ahead.

Who's right?
Buffett and Munger both make some excellent points, and neither man's advice to his heirs is in direct contradiction to the other's. For example, by owning Berkshire shares, Munger's heirs won't have to worry about the investment fees Buffett is trying to protect his wife from. And an S&P 500 index fund has some of the same defensive attributes of Berkshire, such as diversification.
The bottom line is that there's good advice in both Buffett and Munger's wishes for their heirs. The basic difference comes down to what's more important to each -- years of worry-free investing, or the potential to make more money.

Q: I've heard many people recommend index funds for everyday investors, including billionaires like Warren Buffett. Should I just put my money in index funds instead of buying individual stocks?
There certainly are good reasons to invest in index funds as opposed to individual stocks or actively managed mutual funds. In fact, Warren Buffett has even gone so far to say that low-cost index funds are the best investment most Americans can make.
One good reason is diversification. Even if you have 15-20 individual stocks in your portfolio, one of them collapsing could cost you a lot of money. On the other hand, if you buy a S&P 500 index fund, your investment will depend on 500 different stocks, only three of which account for more than 2% of the index (by weight).
Mutual funds can accomplish the same thing, but at a much greater cost. Many actively managed funds have expense ratios of 1% or more, which can eat into your returns over time. In contrast, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO), for example, has an expense ratio of just 0.04% -- so for every $10,000 you have invested, your annual fees and fund expenses will be just $4. 
In fairness, mutual fund fees can be worth it if they are justified by the fund's performance. For example, one of my personal favorite mutual funds, Dodge & Cox Stock Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:DODGX), charges a 0.52% expense ratio, but has consistently outperformed the market for decades, even inclusive of its fees.
To be clear, Buffett wasn't saying that people who have the knowledge, time, and desire to research and choose individual stocks or mutual funds shouldn't do it. In fact, if that's the case, I encourage you to do it. Rather, he's pointing out that most Americans don't have these three characteristics, so index funds are preferable to uneducated stock-picking or, in most cases, choosing actively managed mutual funds.

Ah, retirement. The golden years. This is the time to be catching up on your reading, playing with your grandkids, maybe seeing the world a bit -- but definitely not a time to be worrying about whether your stock portfolio will crash.
To help you accomplish the former things, and avoid the latter, I've screened for stocks offering four attributes that should appeal to retirees -- and really, anyone looking to own a safe stock:

Established companies of decent size ($300 million in market cap and up), with recognizable brand names.
That pay a respectable dividend (at least 4%).
That don't zig and zag with every wobble in the stock market (showing a beta of less than 1).
And last but not least, that don't cost a lot -- at least 20% cheaper than the S&P 500's forward P/E ratio of 25.4.

The following are three stocks that appear well-suited for investors in retirement. Go ahead -- read on and give them a look, and see if you agree.

Regal Entertainment Group
We begin our search today at the movie theater, with Regal Entertainment Group (NYSE:RGC). Now, you may have heard that things aren't going great in the movie business -- that movie fans are staying home and streaming their entertainment, and that no one goes out to the movies anymore. The facts, however, belie this belief. According to Fortune magazine, 2016 was actually the biggest year in American movie history, with more than $11 billion in box office receipts -- and 2017 is projected to be even bigger.
Regal Entertainment Group is capturing a decent share of this growth, with revenue rising nearly 20% over the past five years, and profits up 360%. Grand as that news sounds, Regal is doing even better than it appears to be. Free cash flow (FCF) has exceeded reported net income in each of the past five years, and over the past 12 months, Regal raked in a whopping $250 million in free cash flow -- 41% more cash profit than the company reported as net income. Thus, while Regal stock looks cheap at 18 times earnings today, if you value the stock on free cash flow, it's even cheaper -- less than 13 times FCF. On top of that, the stock pays a 4.1% annual dividend, which is nearly twice the average payout among S&P 500 stocks.
With numbers this good, it's no wonder Regal sports a below-market beta of just 0.9. This is one rock-solid, cash-generating stock.
DineEquity
Looking for a richer dividend payout, or perhaps just a bit of dinner with your show? Look no farther than restaurateur DineEquity (NYSE:DIN), which runs the Applebee's and IHOP chains in the U.S. -- more than 3,700 restaurants in total.
Priced north of $50 a share, DineEquity stock may not look cheap at first glance. But at a P/E ratio of less than 11, DineEquity stock costs less than half the average stock valuation on the S&P. It also pays a massive 7.6% dividend yield that is nearly four times what the average stock pays.
With a deal this good, you might expect that there is a catch, and you'd be right. With fewer people eating out lately, DineEquity has seen slowing sales. That said, DineEquity is a powerful cash producer already, generating more than $92 million in cash profits over the past year (6% more than reported income). So while the company looks cheap valued on GAAP earnings (with a P/E of just 10.6), it's even cheaper when valued on free cash flow -- less than 10 times FCF, despite paying a dividend several times greater than the average stock pays, and offering a beta less than half as volatile as an average stock.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-87407');
            });
        

DSW
Last but not least, we come to DSW (NYSE:DSW). By some measures one of America's top three favorite shoe stores, DSW should be a pretty popular pick for stock shoppers as well; it's got a little bit of something for everyone.
For income investors, DSW pays twice the S&P 500 average, for a yield of 4.2% annually. For stability seekers, it boasts a 0.8 beta, indicating below-average volatility. And for value investors, DSW's income statement is a marvel of earnings quality.
Last year, DSW reported net income of $124.5 million, every penny of which was backed up by honest-to-goodness free cash flow -- $125.3 million worth. And that's no aberration. Like the other stocks on today's list, DSW usually generates better free cash flow than it reports as net income under GAAP -- in three years out of the past five, in fact. As a result, this stock that costs just 12.1 times trailing earnings has an almost identical valuation when valued on free cash flow.
So why is the stock so cheap? Probably, this is a factor of the same problem that has been plaguing brick-and-mortar retailers in recent quarters -- consumers' growing preference for shopping online rather than at physical stores. While DSW has fought this trend successfully in recent years, growing its sales 34% over the past five years despite competition from online e-tailers, the company has struggled to keep profits growing alongside sales.
Analysts who follow the stock, however, believe DSW will soon turn the corner, and post at least 5% annualized earnings growth over the next five years. If they're right, then DSW's bargain basement valuation -- less than half the P/E on the S&P 500 -- could be a real steal of a deal for folks who buy today.

Looking for a richer dividend payout, or perhaps just a bit of dinner with your show? Look no farther than restaurateur DineEquity (NYSE:DIN), which runs the Applebee's and IHOP chains in the U.S. -- more than 3,700 restaurants in total.
Priced north of $50 a share, DineEquity stock may not look cheap at first glance. But at a P/E ratio of less than 11, DineEquity stock costs less than half the average stock valuation on the S&P. It also pays a massive 7.6% dividend yield that is nearly four times what the average stock pays.
With a deal this good, you might expect that there is a catch, and you'd be right. With fewer people eating out lately, DineEquity has seen slowing sales. That said, DineEquity is a powerful cash producer already, generating more than $92 million in cash profits over the past year (6% more than reported income). So while the company looks cheap valued on GAAP earnings (with a P/E of just 10.6), it's even cheaper when valued on free cash flow -- less than 10 times FCF, despite paying a dividend several times greater than the average stock pays, and offering a beta less than half as volatile as an average stock.

            });
        

DSW
Last but not least, we come to DSW (NYSE:DSW). By some measures one of America's top three favorite shoe stores, DSW should be a pretty popular pick for stock shoppers as well; it's got a little bit of something for everyone.
For income investors, DSW pays twice the S&P 500 average, for a yield of 4.2% annually. For stability seekers, it boasts a 0.8 beta, indicating below-average volatility. And for value investors, DSW's income statement is a marvel of earnings quality.
Last year, DSW reported net income of $124.5 million, every penny of which was backed up by honest-to-goodness free cash flow -- $125.3 million worth. And that's no aberration. Like the other stocks on today's list, DSW usually generates better free cash flow than it reports as net income under GAAP -- in three years out of the past five, in fact. As a result, this stock that costs just 12.1 times trailing earnings has an almost identical valuation when valued on free cash flow.
So why is the stock so cheap? Probably, this is a factor of the same problem that has been plaguing brick-and-mortar retailers in recent quarters -- consumers' growing preference for shopping online rather than at physical stores. While DSW has fought this trend successfully in recent years, growing its sales 34% over the past five years despite competition from online e-tailers, the company has struggled to keep profits growing alongside sales.
Analysts who follow the stock, however, believe DSW will soon turn the corner, and post at least 5% annualized earnings growth over the next five years. If they're right, then DSW's bargain basement valuation -- less than half the P/E on the S&P 500 -- could be a real steal of a deal for folks who buy today.

",3 Great Stocks for Retirees
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/31/why-irobot-golar-lng-and-merrimack-pharmaceuticals.aspx,2017-05-31,"
The market has seen an unusual lack of volatility lately, and Wednesday continued the trend, with major benchmarks falling less than 0.15%. The Dow managed to hold onto the 21,000 mark as uncertainty about the future of the U.S. economy seemed to prevent the stock market from continuing its advance from earlier in the month. Yet even though the generally positive mood on Wall Street prevented larger losses for the broader market, some individual stocks weren't as lucky. iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), Golar LNG (NASDAQ:GLNG), and Merrimack Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:MACK) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
iRobot suffers a mild breakdown
Shares of iRobot dropped 7% after the maker of robotic household devices got a downgrade from an analyst company. Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on iRobot from buy to hold, and set a $90-per-share target price on the stock. The share price decline today sent iRobot most of the way to that price target, and the analyst expressed concerns that iRobot might not have any major new product in its lineup this year that could drive near-term growth prospects. In the longer run, Canaccord is more positive on iRobot's future, anticipating fairly substantial growth in 2018 and beyond. The decline today shows that many market participants focus almost exclusively on short-term factors, even when the story for long-term investors still looks attractive.

Golar looks less energetic
Golar LNG stock fell 8% in the wake of the company's first-quarter earnings release. The liquefied natural gas carrier specialist said in its interim financial report that revenue in the first calendar quarter of 2017 was up 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, but higher expenses and a jump in depreciation and amortization costs led to a larger operating loss than in the previous quarter. Losses in its affiliates, including its Golar Power, OneLNG, and Golar Partners stakes, weighed on the company's overall results. Going forward, new liquefaction projects are ramping up production, increasing the level of general activity and boosting demand for shipping. Nevertheless, disappointing results are likely in the second quarter, and it could take some time for positive fundamentals in the industry to show up in Golar LNG's actual results in the future.

            });
        

Merrimack takes a dive
Finally, shares of Merrimack Pharmaceuticals plunged 23%. The biopharmaceutical company's drop stemmed from its decision to replace its CFO and head of corporate development effective in early June. Investors haven't been happy with Merrimack since it made a strategic decision to sell its Onivyde treatment for pancreatic cancer to a third party, leaving it with only a pipeline of prospective candidate drugs. Merrimack does have some potentially promising cancer-fighting drugs, but shareholders don't seem pleased with a key executive's departure at a critical time for the biotech company. Moreover, with the stock having just paid a one-time dividend of roughly a third of its value, some shareholders apparently saw now as a good time to let their shares go.

Wednesday was another quiet day on Wall Street, and major benchmarks finished with small losses at the end of the trading session. With relatively little in the way of significant news, market participants paid closer attention to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book reports from its constituent regional districts. Increasingly, solid economic conditions are convincing investors that the Fed will raise rates in June, and that has some people nervous about whether the long bull market will survive a rising-rate environment.
However, some individual stocks bucked the malaise and moved higher, and Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:HTZ), Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS), and J. Jill (NYSE:JILL) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Hertz drives higher
Shares of Hertz Global Holdings moved 8% higher after the company announced that it would make a major debt offering in an effort to improve the condition of its balance sheet. In particular, Hertz said that it would offer $1 billion in senior second-priority secured notes in a private offering, with the intent of using the proceeds to redeem existing debt due in 2018 and 2019. With the move, Hertz takes another step toward restructuring its substantial debt load, taking advantage of favorable conditions in the credit market to buy itself more time to deal with revenue shortfalls and net losses from its most recent quarter. Hertz's turnaround will take a while, and a single refinancing won't solve the rental-car giant's problems, but it does mark a stepping stone toward reaching greater stability for the business.

Exact Sciences gets another insurer in its corner
Exact Sciences stock gained almost 12% in the wake of news from health insurance giant UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) that it would cover expenses related to Exact Sciences' Cologuard test for colon cancer. User demand for Cologuard has exploded higher, largely because of the convenience of the home test and the ability to avoid the discomfort of a professionally administered colonoscopy. However, the key to success has always been convincing health insurance companies that they should cover the costs of Cologuard tests. With UnitedHealth on board, the odds are good that most major companies will eventually follow suit, and that could spell even greater growth for Exact Sciences over time.

            });
        

J. Jill climbs up the hill
Finally, shares of J. Jill jumped 13%. The retailer of women's clothing and accessories announced its first-quarter financial results that included revenue gains of more than 12% and comparable-sales growth that fell just shy of the 10% mark. Guidance for both the current quarter and the full fiscal year was also encouraging, exceeding what most of those following the stock had anticipated. In a tough environment for retail, J. Jill's performance was especially impressive, given that many competitors have had difficulty producing any kind of positive growth at all, let alone the pace that J. Jill has reached. That could set the stage for the retailer's stock to get back above its initial public offering price and produce real profits for its investors.

As for individual stocks, Bunge (NYSE:BG) and AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) saw heavy trading following market-moving news.

Bunge is a takeover candidate
Bunge shares shot up nearly 17% after the company was identified as an acquisition candidate. The grain and oilseed trader has been approached by commodities giant Glencore for a buyout, according to The Wall Street Journal. No pricing was listed in the report, which noted that a merger would quickly grant Glencore a major presence in the U.S. agriculture market.
As for Bunge, a buyout could take pressure off its agribusiness segment to quickly return to profit growth. That division is suffering from a chronic lack of product lately, especially grains, as farmers hold on to inventory in response to weak commodity prices.

""The slow pace of farmer selling in South America compressed margins in Agribusiness and led to a lower than expected first quarter,"" CEO Soren Schroder told investors in early May after the company posted a sharp dive in net income as its grain business shrank to $17 million from $144 million in the prior-year period.
Schroder and his team still think Bunge will rebound to show growth for the full year because farms are reaching their holding capacities even as producers have generated record bean and corn crops that have yet to hit the market. That optimistic outlook will likely give the company leverage to seek a significant premium in any negotiations with merger candidates.

AutoZone takes a step backwards
AutoZone was the single worst performer in the S&P 500 today. Shares of the auto parts retailer fell almost 12% after the company announced surprisingly weak fiscal third-quarter results showing comparable-store sales growth decelerating for the second straight quarter. Comps shrank 0.8% compared to the prior quarter's flat result.
Thanks to the revenue pressure, AutoZone's earnings expanded by 6.2% to mark only the second time in 11 years in which earnings per share didn't rise by double digits. Management wasn't thrilled with that result. ""Our sales performance for the first five weeks of our quarter was significantly below our expectations,"" CEO Bill Rhodes said in a press release, and mentioned that the quarter's earliest days were impacted by delays in IRS tax refunds. ""The last seven weeks of sales demonstrated improvement, but not enough to make up for our soft start,"" he added.
With comps basically flat over the past nine months, compared to a 3% boost in the prior-year period, AutoZone's stellar growth streak is at risk of stalling this year. Some of that slump can be pinned on things outside of management's control, like weak industry dynamics and the tax refund delays.
Yet the business is also facing spiking competition from online-focused rivals, which presents a different type of challenge. AutoZone's e-commerce segment makes up a small portion of its operations, and that channel isn't showing robust growth right now, which means it may be losing ground to online specialists.

Every company has a chart that defines it.
The chart for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), for instance, would show iPhone sales -- their trend or the evolving share of revenue they account for. After all, the iPhone has made Apple the most valuable company in the world.
That's what a defining chart is. It reflects the core or unique quality that's most responsible for a company's success.
Few are more striking than Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) defining chart. It compares the annual revenue of Wal-Mart to other large companies -- say, those on the S&P 500, which tracks the leading companies in the United States.

Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author.

Despite the enormous size of these other companies, most of which have higher market caps than Wal-Mart, their annual revenues pale in comparison to the Arkansas-based retailer's.

Wal-Mart's revenue over the last 12 months adds up to $486 billion. That's more than twice Apple's total revenue -- which, not to belabor the point, is the most valuable company in America.

",A Foolish Take: The Chart That Defines Wal-Mart
http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/05/12/ask-a-fool-should-i-invest-in-index-funds-instead.aspx,2017-05-12,"
Q: I've heard many people recommend index funds for everyday investors, including billionaires like Warren Buffett. Should I just put my money in index funds instead of buying individual stocks?
There certainly are good reasons to invest in index funds as opposed to individual stocks or actively managed mutual funds. In fact, Warren Buffett has even gone so far to say that low-cost index funds are the best investment most Americans can make.
One good reason is diversification. Even if you have 15-20 individual stocks in your portfolio, one of them collapsing could cost you a lot of money. On the other hand, if you buy a S&P 500 index fund, your investment will depend on 500 different stocks, only three of which account for more than 2% of the index (by weight).
Mutual funds can accomplish the same thing, but at a much greater cost. Many actively managed funds have expense ratios of 1% or more, which can eat into your returns over time. In contrast, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO), for example, has an expense ratio of just 0.04% -- so for every $10,000 you have invested, your annual fees and fund expenses will be just $4. 
In fairness, mutual fund fees can be worth it if they are justified by the fund's performance. For example, one of my personal favorite mutual funds, Dodge & Cox Stock Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:DODGX), charges a 0.52% expense ratio, but has consistently outperformed the market for decades, even inclusive of its fees.
To be clear, Buffett wasn't saying that people who have the knowledge, time, and desire to research and choose individual stocks or mutual funds shouldn't do it. In fact, if that's the case, I encourage you to do it. Rather, he's pointing out that most Americans don't have these three characteristics, so index funds are preferable to uneducated stock-picking or, in most cases, choosing actively managed mutual funds.

If you visit stock listings regularly, or you frequently check your stocks portfolios online, you will probably also see results for three key market measures -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average (""the Dow""), the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite. Most people are familiar with the Dow, and the S&P 500 has become better known in large part because index funds based on it have become much more widely used.
Let's take a closer look at the Nasdaq, though, as it's often underappreciated -- despite being the world's second-largest stock exchange (measured by market capitalization), after the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Image source: Getty Images.

It's got an interesting history
For starters, the Nasdaq has been around for quite a while. It began in 1971, and ""NASDAQ"" stood for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. It was an innovation, offering a more efficient way for stocks to be traded -- in an automated, computerized manner instead of in the old-fashioned in-person way, such as on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. It utilized computer bulletin boards and telephones.
Over the years the Nasdaq bought other exchanges, such as the Boston Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The Philadelphia exchange was the nation's oldest -- two years older than the New York Stock Exchange -- so now the Nasdaq can trace its roots back to 1790. Over time, the Nasdaq became home to many younger and faster-growing companies than the more established ones that tended to populate the New York Stock Exchange, in part because the Nasdaq listing fees were lower.
Today the Nasdaq is the largest electronic stock market, with the highest trading volume among U.S. exchanges and with more than 3,000 listed companies that recently totaled about $11 trillion in value. The biggest company on the Nasdaq is also the biggest in the world -- Apple -- at a market value recently near $800 billion. 

Image source: Getty Images.

It's a stock!
Few people realize that Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) is also a publicly traded company. Based in New York City and currently led by CEO Adena Friedman, it recently sported a market capitalization of about $11 billion -- greater than companies such as Wyndham Worldwide, Harley-Davidson, Gap, and Domino's Pizza.
Nasdaq the stock pays a dividend, too, recently yielding about 2.3%. Its beta of 0.62 reflects lower-than-average volatility, and the fact that its price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales ratios were recently well above their five-year averages suggests that the stock is not a bargain right now.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-82484');
            });
        

It has two key indices associated with it
The Nasdaq is a stock market, not a stock index, but that doesn't mean there aren't Nasdaq-focused indices.
The main Nasdaq index is the Nasdaq Composite, which reflects all the 3,000-plus components of the Nasdaq stock market. When you hear that ""the Nasdaq"" rose a few points or fell some, the Nasdaq Composite index is what's being referred to.
The Nasdaq 100 is a rather prominent index, too, featuring roughly 100 holdings. Making its debut in 1985, it's a widely followed index today, averaging annual returns of about 10.8% over the past 15 years, compared with only 7.4% for the S&P 500. It's a tech-heavy index, without any financial companies in it. It's market-cap-weighted, too, meaning that the largest companies in it (in terms of market cap) will wield the biggest influence on it. Its main components are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet, and Comcast. You can invest in the Nasdaq 100 through the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ).

",A Foolish Take: The Chart That Defines Wal-Mart
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/28/3-stocks-the-market-is-wrong-about.aspx,2017-05-28,"
There's an old investing truism that says the market almost always gets a company's valuation right -- over the long term.
But in the short term (which can last for several years), good companies can get overlooked -- and that can create some nice investing opportunities. We asked some of our Foolish contributors to single out the companies they see as especially undervalued by the market right now. Here's why they think the market has overlooked the potential at Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA), and General Motors (NYSE:GM) -- and how investors could benefit from buying now. 

Two big reasons to get excited about GM: A self-driving Chevy Bolt and CEO Mary Barra. Image source: General Motors.

An old giant that's out-disrupting its would-be disruptors
John Rosevear (General Motors): It seems like tech analysts can't stop telling us how the traditional automakers are toast. Electric vehicles and self-driving systems from upstart Silicon Valley companies are going to disrupt the old giants just like Apple's iPhone crushed the older cellphone makers -- or so the story goes.
GM CEO Mary Barra has different ideas, and already GM is out in front of Silicon Valley on some key fronts. Tesla gets the hype (and the wild valuation), but it's GM that was the first to ship a mass-market electric vehicle with over 200 miles of range, the Chevrolet Bolt. And it's very likely that GM will be the first to ship a mass-produced self-driving vehicle in the coming months, when it produces a big batch of self-driving Bolts for ride-hailing duty with Lyft.
Did I mention that GM owns 9% of Lyft? Or that it owns 100% of Maven, an app-driven urban car-sharing company? Or that the Bolt was designed from the ground up to serve as a platform for future tech including (but not limited to) GM's homegrown self-driving system, and optimized for fleet use in urban settings with companies like Lyft and Maven?
More than just about any automaker, GM has positioned itself to thrive and profit handsomely in the self-driving shared-mobility future. Meanwhile, its core business continues to generate huge profits in the U.S. and China, thanks to the popularity of GM's well-regarded line of SUVs and trucks. And Barra and her team have been relentless about cutting marginal businesses -- including selling off GM's money-losing European operation -- and investing in new products to maximize profitability now and boost it significantly in the future.
So why is GM selling at just 5.4 times its expected 2017 earnings? It's partly because of concerns about the U.S. new-car market, which looks to be past its cyclical peak. But it's also because of that narrative I outlined above. 
Sooner or later, Wall Street (and those tech analysts) are going to catch on to what GM is doing -- and sooner or later, its stock price should jump. Buy it now, reinvest GM's nice (and sustainable) 4.6% dividend, and you could enjoy a handsome payoff in time.
A biotech worthy of more excitement
Keith Speights (Celgene): So far in 2017, Celgene is underperforming the S&P 500 index. Argus Research analyst David Toung even downgraded the big biotech stock, expressing concerns about Celgene's reliance on blood cancer drug Revlimid for much of its revenue. The market just hasn't been excited about Celgene lately. But it should be.
Toung is right that Celgene derives around 64% of its total revenue from Revlimid. However, Revlimid generated 66% of Celgene's revenue in 2013, a year in which the biotech's share price more than doubled. The drug accounted for 65% of total revenue in 2014, when Celgene stock jumped 30%. What's so bad about where Celgene is now with Revlimid?
Worries about too much reliance on one drug also miss an important point: Celgene could soon have plenty of big winners on the market. The biotech expects to report results from 19 late-stage clinical studies over the next couple of years. Celgene stands a good chance of winning approval for seven drugs between now and the end of 2020 that could have potential for annual sales of at least $1 billion.
The first of those drugs could be on the market next year. In February, Celgene reported great results from a late-stage study of ozanimod in treating multiple sclerosis. The company expects to submit the drug for approval by the end of the year. Ozanimod could generate peak annual sales of $2 billion in the indication, with more added to that if it also wins approval for treating ulcerative colitis.  
In the meantime, Revlimid should be in good position to keep making more money for years to come. Continued strength for Revlimid and other blockbuster drugs Pomalyst and Otezla combined with a loaded pipeline prompted me to make the case not long ago that Celgene should be a top biotech stock for the next decade or more. I still think that's the case.

            });
        

An underrated apparel company
Keith Noonan (Under Armour): There are few stocks that the market has soured on more than Under Armour. The company's Class A shares trade roughly 45% lower than they did a year ago while the S&P 500 index has climbed 17% over the stretch. In fact, the company was one of the S&P 500's biggest losers in 2016, and also the index's biggest loser in the first quarter of 2017. It's not hard to understand some of the negative sentiment that now surrounds the company, but the market appears to be undervaluing Under Armour's growth potential.
While weak domestic performance due to the closing of retail sports outlets and sluggish sales for key product releases are certainly disappointing, the apparel company still has compelling strengths and substantial growth avenues ahead. Under Armour's opportunity to increase business overseas is particularly noteworthy, with only around 20% of revenue currently derived from international sales and 52% year-over-year sales growth in the last quarter pointing to significant long-term expansion.
The company's push to better incorporate technology across all rungs of its business is also promising. While there's not much to point to in terms of material contribution at the moment, increasing use of data analytics to better understand and reach customers as well as the company's sizable investment in connected fitness technologies are the type of forward-thinking moves that could translate to lasting advantages.
Under Armour might not be a fit for risk-averse investors, but it has lots of room to run, and the market doesn't seem to be giving it the credit that it's due.
",3 Stocks the Market Is Wrong About
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/28/3-stocks-the-market-is-wrong-about.aspx,2017-05-28,"
There's an old investing truism that says the market almost always gets a company's valuation right -- over the long term.
But in the short term (which can last for several years), good companies can get overlooked -- and that can create some nice investing opportunities. We asked some of our Foolish contributors to single out the companies they see as especially undervalued by the market right now. Here's why they think the market has overlooked the potential at Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA), and General Motors (NYSE:GM) -- and how investors could benefit from buying now. 

Two big reasons to get excited about GM: A self-driving Chevy Bolt and CEO Mary Barra. Image source: General Motors.

An old giant that's out-disrupting its would-be disruptors
John Rosevear (General Motors): It seems like tech analysts can't stop telling us how the traditional automakers are toast. Electric vehicles and self-driving systems from upstart Silicon Valley companies are going to disrupt the old giants just like Apple's iPhone crushed the older cellphone makers -- or so the story goes.
GM CEO Mary Barra has different ideas, and already GM is out in front of Silicon Valley on some key fronts. Tesla gets the hype (and the wild valuation), but it's GM that was the first to ship a mass-market electric vehicle with over 200 miles of range, the Chevrolet Bolt. And it's very likely that GM will be the first to ship a mass-produced self-driving vehicle in the coming months, when it produces a big batch of self-driving Bolts for ride-hailing duty with Lyft.
Did I mention that GM owns 9% of Lyft? Or that it owns 100% of Maven, an app-driven urban car-sharing company? Or that the Bolt was designed from the ground up to serve as a platform for future tech including (but not limited to) GM's homegrown self-driving system, and optimized for fleet use in urban settings with companies like Lyft and Maven?
More than just about any automaker, GM has positioned itself to thrive and profit handsomely in the self-driving shared-mobility future. Meanwhile, its core business continues to generate huge profits in the U.S. and China, thanks to the popularity of GM's well-regarded line of SUVs and trucks. And Barra and her team have been relentless about cutting marginal businesses -- including selling off GM's money-losing European operation -- and investing in new products to maximize profitability now and boost it significantly in the future.
So why is GM selling at just 5.4 times its expected 2017 earnings? It's partly because of concerns about the U.S. new-car market, which looks to be past its cyclical peak. But it's also because of that narrative I outlined above. 
Sooner or later, Wall Street (and those tech analysts) are going to catch on to what GM is doing -- and sooner or later, its stock price should jump. Buy it now, reinvest GM's nice (and sustainable) 4.6% dividend, and you could enjoy a handsome payoff in time.
A biotech worthy of more excitement
Keith Speights (Celgene): So far in 2017, Celgene is underperforming the S&P 500 index. Argus Research analyst David Toung even downgraded the big biotech stock, expressing concerns about Celgene's reliance on blood cancer drug Revlimid for much of its revenue. The market just hasn't been excited about Celgene lately. But it should be.
Toung is right that Celgene derives around 64% of its total revenue from Revlimid. However, Revlimid generated 66% of Celgene's revenue in 2013, a year in which the biotech's share price more than doubled. The drug accounted for 65% of total revenue in 2014, when Celgene stock jumped 30%. What's so bad about where Celgene is now with Revlimid?
Worries about too much reliance on one drug also miss an important point: Celgene could soon have plenty of big winners on the market. The biotech expects to report results from 19 late-stage clinical studies over the next couple of years. Celgene stands a good chance of winning approval for seven drugs between now and the end of 2020 that could have potential for annual sales of at least $1 billion.
The first of those drugs could be on the market next year. In February, Celgene reported great results from a late-stage study of ozanimod in treating multiple sclerosis. The company expects to submit the drug for approval by the end of the year. Ozanimod could generate peak annual sales of $2 billion in the indication, with more added to that if it also wins approval for treating ulcerative colitis.  
In the meantime, Revlimid should be in good position to keep making more money for years to come. Continued strength for Revlimid and other blockbuster drugs Pomalyst and Otezla combined with a loaded pipeline prompted me to make the case not long ago that Celgene should be a top biotech stock for the next decade or more. I still think that's the case.

An underrated apparel company
Keith Noonan (Under Armour): There are few stocks that the market has soured on more than Under Armour. The company's Class A shares trade roughly 45% lower than they did a year ago while the S&P 500 index has climbed 17% over the stretch. In fact, the company was one of the S&P 500's biggest losers in 2016, and also the index's biggest loser in the first quarter of 2017. It's not hard to understand some of the negative sentiment that now surrounds the company, but the market appears to be undervaluing Under Armour's growth potential.
While weak domestic performance due to the closing of retail sports outlets and sluggish sales for key product releases are certainly disappointing, the apparel company still has compelling strengths and substantial growth avenues ahead. Under Armour's opportunity to increase business overseas is particularly noteworthy, with only around 20% of revenue currently derived from international sales and 52% year-over-year sales growth in the last quarter pointing to significant long-term expansion.
The company's push to better incorporate technology across all rungs of its business is also promising. While there's not much to point to in terms of material contribution at the moment, increasing use of data analytics to better understand and reach customers as well as the company's sizable investment in connected fitness technologies are the type of forward-thinking moves that could translate to lasting advantages.

",3 Stocks the Market Is Wrong About
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/30/why-tivo-xactly-and-crocs-jumped-today.aspx,2017-05-30,"
The stock market got off to a slow start on Tuesday, coming out of the holiday weekend with modest losses. The Dow Jones Industrials finished the day with a drop of about 50 points, and other major benchmarks were down by similarly small percentages. With earnings season drawing to a close, investors are turning their attention to economic data. The latest reading on the employment picture due out on Friday should shine a light on a key metric that the Federal Reserve will consider later in June in its decision on whether to raise short-term interest rates again.
Yet despite the quiet trading overall, some individual companies had good news, and TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO), Xactly (NYSE:XTLY), and Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
TiVo gets a win
Shares of TiVo jumped 14% in the wake of good news on the legal front. The video-recording technology provider won a favorable ruling from the International Trade Commission in connection with its set-top box patents, as an administrative law judge found that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) had violated TiVo's intellectual property rights. Although a final ruling likely won't be made until September, those following the case believe that Comcast is likely to settle with TiVo, and that could bring a bunch of cash into TiVo's coffers in short order. Given that TiVo had already started to see some signs of life earlier in 2017 in part because of its merger with Rovi, the ruling could generate even more positive momentum for TiVo going forward.

Xactly gets a buyout bid
Xactly stock climbed 16% after the company received an acquisition bid from private equity investor Vista Equity Partners. Vista offered Xactly $564 million for the company, translating to shareholders receiving $15.65 per share in cash for their stock. The day's jump sent Xactly shares to within pennies of the buyout price, suggesting that at least some investors believe that a rival bid might be in the offing. The move higher follows a period of relative stagnation for the enterprise cloud-based incentive compensation specialist, which late last year suggested that its future results might slow down despite an overall positive environment in cloud computing. Now, it appears likely that Vista will reap the rewards of future success from Xactly.

            });
        

If the Crocs fit, wear them
Finally, shares of Crocs gained nearly 5%. The footwear maker received positive comments from Barron's over the weekend, which argued that even as many investors in retail companies worry about the potential impact of e-commerce specialists on brick-and-mortar retailers, Crocs has already demonstrated its ability to restructure itself to adapt to changing conditions. The shoemaker faced difficult challenges in 2016, including falling gross margin, legal issues, and overall uncertainty about future demand. Yet with Crocs stock bouncing earlier this month on a potential uptick on the earnings front, bulls believe that if there's a company that can survive the attack of online retail specialists, it's the once-iconic shoe manufacturer.

","Why TiVo, Xactly, and Crocs Jumped Today"
http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/05/26/ask-a-fool-is-shorting-a-stock-a-good-idea.aspx,2017-05-26,"
Q: I have a negative opinion of Snap as an investment. Should I short the stock?
Selling a stock short or ""shorting"" the stock is certainly a way to bet against a company's success. I generally advise most investors to avoid shorting, but if you do decide to short a stock, here's what you need to know first.
When you short sell a stock, you're borrowing the shares from your brokerage, and selling them on the open market at today's price. The idea is that when the stock goes down, you can buy the shares back later for a lower price, give them back to your broker, and pocket the difference.
As an example, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) trades for about $22 as I write this. If you were to short sell 100 shares of Snap for $2,200, and the stock falls to $15, you can buy those 100 shares back for $1,500, and the $700 difference is your profit. Sounds good, right?
However, the risk with shorting a stock is the unlimited loss potential. If you short a stock and it goes up, there's no limit to how high it can go. At some point, you'll need to buy back the shares you borrowed from your broker. In our previous example, let's say that Snap has a blowout quarter and the price shoots up to $50. You're now on the hook for buying 100 shares for $5,000. If the stock continues to skyrocket to $100, you'll need to come up with $10,000 to close out the trade, which would translate to a loss of $7,800.
The bottom line is that if you do short a stock, you need to have a predetermined exit strategy in mind -- specifically, a point where you admit you were wrong and take a loss if the trade doesn't go your way.

",Ask a Fool: Is Shorting a Stock a Good Idea?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/27/3-dividend-stocks-that-thrive-in-market-crashes.aspx,2017-05-27,"
No one likes market crashes. Even the best stocks often get swept up in the panic. Whether a market crash is on the horizon is unpredictable, but investors can position themselves defensively by owning quality dividend stocks that hold up better than most when things take a turn for the worse. Here's why Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Clorox (NYSE:CLX), and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) are good bets for risk-averse investors.
Necessary products
Brian Stoffel (Johnson & Johnson): I'm not sure if there's such a thing as a recession-proof dividend stock, but Johnson & Johnson is surely a recession-resistant one. The company has three divisions: consumer products like Band-Aids and Tylenol, medical equipment, and pharmaceuticals.

Image source: Johnson & Johnson.

If you sit back and think about it, while people or hospitals may cut back on spending when the economy falters or the market crashes, they surely won't give up such purchases altogether. That's because they're vital no matter the economic climate.
Indeed, between 2008 and 2010, overall company sales fell just 3.4%. That helps explain how the company's stock outperformed the S&P 500 by 22 percentage points from January 2008 to the depths of the stock market's crash.
Not only that, but reinvested dividends from the swoon were worth even more. By March 2009, the company's yield rose to 4.1% That's the beauty of solid dividend stocks in market crashes: If they don't dive, you're happy to preserve your capital; if they do dive, just remind yourself that your reinvested dividends will be worth even more in the future.
If a market crash occurred today, investors could laugh it off. Johnson & Johnson's dividend is very safe, with only 61% of free cash flow being used to pay it over the past 12 months. Given the other dynamics covered above, that makes it a great holding for the risk-averse to consider.
Battle-tested brands
Tim Green (Clorox): A company that sells products with strong brands that people need to buy is often a good bet in the event of a market crash. Clorox, known for its namesake bleach as well as Glad trash bags and cling wrap, Brita water filters, and Liquid Plumr, barely felt the last great market crash in 2008. The stock dropped a bit, but it remained relatively unscathed compared to the broader market.

CLX data by YCharts
Clorox is not a cheap stock, and the company isn't growing very fast, as I pointed out last month. The dividend yield of around 2.6% is higher than that of the S&P 500 Index, but dividend growth will almost certainly be sluggish going forward.
That doesn't mean that Clorox isn't a solid company, though. Despite competition from cheaper store-brand alternatives, the company didn't miss a beat during the financial crisis, with revenue growing and margins feeling little pressure. A combination of good products and some great brands prevented consumers from switching away from Clorox's products.
I wouldn't expect great returns from Clorox stock going forward, considering its valuation and minimal growth prospects. But if you want something stable and unlikely to fall apart when the stock market or the economy turns south, Clorox is a pretty good choice.

            });
        

Beating the market with science
Cory Renauer (Amgen): Investors looking for crash-resistant dividend stocks should consider this blue-chip biotech. While stocks in this industry aren't generally famous for steady dividend growth, Amgen has hiked its payout regularly since it began making them in 2011. Those hikes have been substantial as well, rising at a 48.2% annual rate over the past five years.
Although Amgen wasn't paying a dividend during the last big market crash, it's performance during the Great Recession was outstanding. Between the beginnings of 2008 and 2009, the biotech stock rose 23.9% while the benchmark SPDR S&P 500 ETF fell 37.7%.
It isn't every year that this purveyor of pricey biologic drugs beats the broader market by more than 60 percentage points, but Amgen has continued to outperform the market from the beginning of 2009 through the present.
Looking into the company's recent performance, and development pipeline, there could be more market-beating gains and dividend growth ahead. Although first-quarter revenue came in 1% lower than the year-ago period, cost-cutting and stock buybacks allowed adjusted earnings to rise 9% to $3.15 per share. The company also recently announced clinical trial results that show its experimental therapy, erenumab, significantly reduces monthly migraine headaches.
At recent prices, the stock offers a nice 2.9% yield that you can reasonably expect to continue growing. The company generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter but used just $847 million to make dividend payments during the three-month period. If approved, erenumab could generate more than $2 billion in annual sales at its peak, which, when combined with leaner operations, could give Amgen plenty more cash to continue raising payments -- even if the broader market tanks.

",3 Dividend Stocks That Thrive in Market Crashes
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/26/these-are-the-10-lowest-pe-stocks-today.aspx,2017-05-26,"
Value investors like stocks whose share prices are relatively inexpensive compared to their earnings potential. By focusing on stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios, many value investors uncover stocks that have been unfairly punished by the market at large. However, in many cases, stocks that have low P/E ratios have a good reason for trading where they do, making some of them serious value traps. Below, you'll find the 10 stocks in the S&P 500 that have the lowest trailing earnings multiples, along with some discussion about whether they're actually good bargains for value investors going forward.
The 10 lowest P/Es today
Here are the 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with the lowest trailing P/E ratios as of May 25:

General Motors (NYSE:GM)

7.5

7.6

8

Michael Kors


8.3




Data source: Finviz, Yahoo! Finance.
We can dispense with some of these stocks very quickly, based on known facts that make their trailing earnings multiples misleading. In the case of eBay, Transocean, and Corning, current earnings have been inflated to some extent, and investors fully expect that future earnings will be lower. Both eBay and Corning have forward earnings multiples in the teens, and most investors actually expect Transocean to post a loss in the near future, rendering its P/E ratio meaningless.
Highly sensitive company-specific news is also a cause for some of these stocks to trade at these levels. Signet, for instance, has had to deal with controversy related to allegations of sexual harassment and wage disparities within the company, and its most recent results included an 11.5% plunge in same-store sales from year-ago levels. That's enough to make some investors hesitate going forward.
Cyclical concerns
One group of stocks on this list has low P/E ratios in large part because investors see their respective industries near the high point of the business cycle. General Motors has enjoyed the benefits of record auto sales in the industry in 2015 and 2016, but few think that its upward trajectory can continue. Similarly, Gilead Sciences has seen huge long-term growth from its stable of treatments for diseases like HIV, but many are concerned that the loss of patent protection on key products will result in an inevitable sales decline that will affect the bottom line as well.
The key for such stocks is to recognize that when the low end of the cycle hits, their P/E ratios will look extremely high. It's important to get familiar with the range of earnings ratios throughout the cycle. That way, when you see extremely low values like this, you won't overreact, because you'll know that when industry conditions return to more normal levels, P/Es will be more reasonable.

            });
        

Challenging situations
Another group of stocks on the list reflect the challenges that companies face in particular industries. Bed Bath & Beyond and Michael Kors are dealing with tough conditions in retail, and they've had difficulty fending off competition from e-commerce specialists while also struggling to retain their leadership roles in their respective niches. If they can retrench and find ways to grow, then their share prices should recover, but they first have to find answers to the competitive threats they face.
Similar issues apply to other companies. Navient provides servicing and collection help on student loans, and the combination of a rising rate environment and greater attention on the student-loan problem could put pressure on Navient going forward.

Image source: Goodyear.

The most interesting stock on the list
In that light, Goodyear Tire & Rubber is arguably the most interesting company among these 10 low P/E stocks. Goodyear has ambitious goals for the near future, including plans to boost operating margin, free cash flow, and dividends over the next several years. Although many investors note that most of the company's revenue comes from tire replacement -- something that doesn't necessarily offer much room for long-term growth -- Goodyear has done a good job of gaining first-mover status in China. For nearly a quarter-century, Goodyear has worked to grow in the world's second-largest economy, and decisions to expand its factory presence in China should pay off with a greater portion of global sales coming from the most populous nation in the world by the end of the decade. If you believe in that growth story, then current P/E levels look extremely low for Goodyear.
Just because a stock has a low earnings multiple doesn't make it a bargain. By understanding the reasons why a stock has a low P/E, you can better assess whether the company really deserves a place in your investment portfolio.

",These Are the 10 Lowest P/E Stocks Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/26/3-things-investors-should-know-about-hormel-foods.aspx,2017-05-26,"
Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) may not ring a bell to some investors, but chances are you know some of its brands. Through its 126-year history, this dividend stock has come to own a wide variety of household names, including Skippy, Spam, and Muscle Milk. 
Hormel Foods is a favorite of income investors seeking a recession-proof stock, as many of the products in its portfolio sell in good economies and bad. The stock has been a steady winner over the past 40 years, returning more than 22,000%,  and that's without including dividends. 

Image source: Hormel Foods.

With a track record like that, it's easy to see why the stock continues to attract investors. Here are three things potential investors should know about Hormel Foods stock.
1. It's a dividend aristocrat
Hormel Foods is among the exclusive group of stocks in the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats. These are S&P 500 stocks that have raised their dividend every year for 25 years or more. Hormel has been paying increasing dividends for 51 years in a row, longer than all but a handful of stocks. And it hasn't been a slouch with its recent dividend boosts. Last November, it raised its dividend 17% to $0.68 per share, and before that lifted the payout 16%. The payout has more than doubled over the past five years:

HRL Dividend data by YCharts
Hormel's status as a Dividend Aristocrat shows management's commitment to returning capital to shareholders, and the company's payout ratio, or the percentage of income it spends on dividends, is just 34.5%, meaning there's plenty of room to raise the quarterly payouts even if profit growth subsides.
2. The stock is cheap
On a P/E basis, Hormel Foods shares are the cheapest they've been in four years, at an earnings valuation of 21.4:

HRL PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts
That valuation is cheap compared not only with the company's recent historical valuation but also with its peers, including packaged-food brands such as McCormick, Campbell Soup, and Kellogg. It's in line with peers such as General Mills and J.M. Smucker. 
The defensive sector has underperformed recently, as these stocks missed out on the post-election rally led by cyclicals and financials, and investors have also been concerned about slow growth and expensive prices for potential acquisitions. Arguably, the entire sector was inflated, but as prices have come down, shares in Hormel and others seem more reasonable.
In Hormel's most recent quarter, earnings per share increased just 2% to $0.44, and sales slipped 1% to $2.3 billion. Accounting for the divestiture of Diamond Crystal and Farmer John brands and the acquisition of Justin's, sales increased 3%.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-14485');
            });
        

3. Portfolio management is key
Packaged-food companies such as Hormel are playing a tricky game. They must diversify their brand portfolios to include fast-growing organic brands, while managing the decline or plateauing of legacy brands.
In each of the past five years, Hormel has made a significant acquisition. In 2012, it added Wholly Guacamole and its family of dips for $220 million; 2013 brought Skippy peanut butter on board for $700 million. In 2014, it acquired the Muscle Milk line of protein shakes for $450 million, and the following year, it made its biggest purchase to date, taking over Applegate organic deli meats for $775 million. Last year, it bought Justin's, an organic nut-butter brand, for $286 million. Those purchases combined have cost more than $2 billion. 
That string of acquisitions has led the stock to more than double in the past five years, but management has been able to keep its debt burden to just $250 million. That leaves the door open for further acquisitions, especially if the company continues to sell off brands, as it did last year.
With nearly $1 billion in profit a year, management isn't hesitant to get its checkbook out. Don't be surprised if Hormel takes over another upstart brand this year, for the sixth time in a row.

3. Portfolio management is key
Packaged-food companies such as Hormel are playing a tricky game. They must diversify their brand portfolios to include fast-growing organic brands, while managing the decline or plateauing of legacy brands.
In each of the past five years, Hormel has made a significant acquisition. In 2012, it added Wholly Guacamole and its family of dips for $220 million; 2013 brought Skippy peanut butter on board for $700 million. In 2014, it acquired the Muscle Milk line of protein shakes for $450 million, and the following year, it made its biggest purchase to date, taking over Applegate organic deli meats for $775 million. Last year, it bought Justin's, an organic nut-butter brand, for $286 million. Those purchases combined have cost more than $2 billion. 
That string of acquisitions has led the stock to more than double in the past five years, but management has been able to keep its debt burden to just $250 million. That leaves the door open for further acquisitions, especially if the company continues to sell off brands, as it did last year.
With nearly $1 billion in profit a year, management isn't hesitant to get its checkbook out. Don't be surprised if Hormel takes over another upstart brand this year, for the sixth time in a row.

Chris Hill: Time to get to the stocks on our radar this week. Our man behind the glass, Steve Broido, will hit you with a question. Simon Erickson, you're up first. What are you looking at?
Simon Erickson: Chris, this is early research for me, so buyer beware on this one, but I'm looking at HDFC Bank. The ticker is HDB, that's for the American depositary receipts. This is an India-based bank. The reason that it's interesting to me is, last November, India has really been trying to cut down on corruption, so what they're doing is invalidating their paper currency, they're trying to pull people into digital banks. That's going to take a lot of costs out of transactions and boost the transaction volumes, I think, for banks like HDFC. I think this could be a big opportunity for that company.
Hill: Steve, question about HDFC?
Steve Broido: How important is internet access then, if everything is going digital?
Erickson: Hugely important. You can't get on to a digital bank if you don't have an internet connection. But a lot of it, actually, Steve, isn't going through desktop computers like we had in the States, it's going off of mobile phones.
Hill: David Kretzmann, what are you looking at?
David Kretzmann: I'm looking at Stamps.com, ticker STMP. This is a software-as-a-service provider of shipping solutions geared toward small businesses and enterprises of all sizes that basically sells stuff online that needs to be shipped somewhere. So, whether you're selling on Amazon or eBay or Etsy or wherever, Stamps' software will integrate that into a single place and help you find the best deal on shipping from USPS, UPS, FedEx, or others. Their retention rates are rising, it's a subscription business, and average revenue per user is also on the rise. So, good combination for a subscription company.
Hill: Steve, question about Stamps.com?
Broido: How can the margins be good if the U.S. Postal Service charges what they charge, and then you have a middle person inserted here. How does this make sense?
Kretzmann: They don't make the money on the postage. That's just sold at cost. They make money from the monthly subscription cost.
Hill: Jeff Fischer, you're up.
Jeff Fischer: Nothing too exciting, but it's fun to think about the companies that you love, and really make your life better, whether it's Starbucks or Amazon, or, in this case, Southwest Airlines, ticker is LUV. I can't tell you how many times it's improved my life by being able to change my flight to somewhere at the last minute. The stock trades at 15 times forward earnings. It's returned 15% annualized the past 10 years, which is more than double the S&P 500's annualized return. I think the future looks bright as oil costs remain modest.
Hill: Steve?
Broido: Is there too much comedy in Southwest Airlines? Every flight attendant seems to be making a lot of jokes. I'm not interested in laughing, I just want to get where I'm going.
Fischer: I guess if you're a grumpy, aging man, there's too much comedy.
Broido: That was a statement, not a question.
Hill: Steve, do you have a stock you want to add to your watch list?
Broido: I think Simon's looks pretty interesting.
Erickson: All right.
Hill: We knew he wasn't going with Southwest.

Financial stocks led the market in trading volumes, and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) mimicked the broader market's flat result. Gold prices rose by nearly a full percentage point to help push the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEMKT:GDX) up 1%.
As for individual stocks, Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) saw heavy trading following the companies' quarterly earnings announcements.

Deckers Outdoor boosts profits
Deckers Outdoor stock jumped nearly 19% after the footwear specialist posted surprisingly strong results for its fiscal fourth quarter. The top- and bottom-line figures weren't especially impressive, with revenue falling 2.4% and adjusted earnings holding steady at $0.11 per share.

Image source: Getty Images.

But the sales figure easily beat management's February forecast that predicted a drop of as much as 6%. The profit result also outpaced consensus estimates looking for a loss of $0.06 per share, due to a mix of cost cuts and improved pricing trends. ""I am proud of the work the team has accomplished"" in improving profitability, CEO Dave Powers said in a press release.
Gross profit margin jumped to 43% of sales from 40.9% as Deckers scaled back on its promotions. Its core brands -- including UGG, Teva, and Sanuk -- all experienced volume declines.
Powers and his team see room to cut $150 million out of its cost infrastructure over the next three fiscal years. The retailer might benefit from a sales turnaround, too, given that executives forecast modest revenue gains for the current quarter. The improving operating and financial trends could give executives added leverage in any buyout negotiations they conduct as they look for ways to maximize shareholder returns.

            });
        

GameStop returns to growth
Shares of specialty retailer GameStop slipped 6% after the company announced fiscal first-quarter earnings in which sales growth returned amid declining profits. The revenue rebound came courtesy of healthy demand for new gaming consoles that offset declines in its software segment. GameStop also benefited from increases in its consumer products and collectibles divisions, two areas it sees as critical to its plan to diversify away from the shrinking market for physical video game discs. ""Our first quarter results reflect the power of our leadership position within the video game market and our ongoing diversification efforts,"" CEO Paul Raines said in a press release.
The retailer still sees its comparable-store sales ranging between flat and a 5% decline in 2017 as earnings fall for the second straight year. Its nearly 7% dividend yield remains well covered both by earnings and cash flow. However, Wall Street chose to focus instead on GameStop's uncertain revenue outlook in an era of weakening customer traffic trends among major retailers.
Investors who are comfortable with that elevated risk might find the stock attractive given that it comes with one of the market's biggest dividend yields. GameStop is likely to post another year of declining top- and bottom-line numbers in 2017, but its results don't indicate the type of collapsing business that its valuation of just six times earnings would imply.
",What Happened in the Stock Market Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/30/heres-why-the-worst-may-be-yet-to-come-for-qualcom.aspx,2017-05-30,"
Few large-cap companies have had as grueling a last three years as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
Hit by a raft of fines and court cases the world over, Qualcomm stock has underperformed its benchmark, the Nasdaq Composite, by a whopping 55% over this time frame:

QCOM data by YCharts.
To be sure, the company has attempted to counter the seemingly permanent stream of bad news. However, cautious investors may want to think twice before purchasing Qualcomm stock, as the road ahead still appears fraught with risk for the mobile-chip giant.
Two ways to look at Qualcomm's legal woes
Qualcomm's legal headaches are, perhaps, best examined through two lenses: potential fines, and possible required changes to its patent-licensing practices.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-75699');
            });
        


First, and far less daunting, the possible financial sting would hurt but not kill Qualcomm. In fact, we can use Qualcomm's history of antitrust fines to estimate a plausible range of future costs, then apply them to the company's many ongoing legal battles.
We know Qualcomm already paid $975 million to settle an antitrust case with Chinese regulators in 2015. Similarly, South Korean regulators also fined Qualcomm $853 million at the end of 2016, though the company has yet to pay this, as it plans to challenge the ruling. So admitting a fair degree of imprecision here, we can reach a ballpark estimate that Qualcomm's fines may run about $1 billion each.
Since at last count Qualcomm had four anti-competitive legal cases underway -- South Korea, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the European Union, and Apple -- we can estimate that Qualcomm's legal fees might clock in somewhere around $4 billion, assuming that no more arise in the near future.
Qualcomm carried about $30 billion in cash and investments as of its most recent earnings report, though a large portion of it was likely earmarked for Qualcomm's pending $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductor. However, given its ability to tap debt markets, Qualcomm can probably afford to meet its legal bills, barring some unexpectedly high fee from regulators.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-19406');
            });
        


This brings up the second, more ambiguous, and possibly more pernicious aspect of Qualcomm's legal issues: possible alterations to its patent-licensing terms. Though these are difficult to handicap, investors need to be aware that Qualcomm has been forced to modify its patent-licensing fees in the past; it did so as part of its settlement with Chinese regulators. This didn't materially affect Qualcomm; its revenues actually increased in China from 2015 to 2016.
However, the fact that Qualcomm's core business driver could possibly see its profit model weaken is absolutely essential for any prospective investor to realize, even if it's hard to apply a possible dollar value to this unseemly outcome.

Qualcomm stock is both cheap and risky
So given all the risk clouding its business outlook, it should come as no surprise that Qualcomm stock has been bid down to temptingly cheap levels. For context, here's a quick snapshot of the beleaguered chipmaker's valuation metrics:


Current P/EForward P/EDividend Yield



19.9
14.6
3.6%



Data source: Yahoo! Finance. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-77739');
            });
        


These metrics compare quite favorably to the market averages; the S&P 500 currently sports a P/E of 25 and a 1.9% dividend yield. However, given all the uncertainty surrounding Qualcomm, is this kind of discount to the market justified, or does it reflect an opportunity for investors?
Turning to the analyst community as a possible guidepost, the average of sell-side estimates expect Qualcomm's sales to fall 3.4% this year and rise 0.6% in 2018. More concerning still, they forecast its earnings per share to fall roughly 5% this year and 4% next year -- far from cataclysmic, but certainly not ideal.
Given the lack of clarity surrounding Qualcomm, it's extremely difficult to get a sense of what the future holds for the company's financial performance and, by extension, its share price. However, if the current lawsuits produce fines are limited to expectations discussed above, Qualcomm stock will likely have been an attractive buy in retrospect. On the other hand, since it's so hard to predict the most likely result for Qualcomm, investors might be best served by simply focusing their efforts on less risky areas of the tech industry until more evidence emerges.

I read that Apple has $256.8 billion in cash. Wouldn't it be better to use that money to expand its business or pay shareholders a dividend?
Ideally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would use its cash hoard to make acquisitions that add value to the company. As my Foolish colleague Adam Levy recently pointed out, Apple could easily buy a major media outlet such as Time Warner or Viacom, a content-distribution platform like Netflix, and a music-streaming company like SiriusXM or Pandora, and still have cash left over to give its shareholders a big one-time dividend payment. I'm not saying that any of these would necessarily be in the best interests of Apple investors, but the point is that the company could do it.
The problem is where Apple's cash is. The vast majority of Apple's cash stockpile -- 94% at the end of 2016 -- is held overseas. If it were to bring the cash back to the U.S. to put to work, it would need to pay hefty repatriation taxes on the money. The corporate tax rate is currently 35%, so we're talking about over $80 billion in taxes just to bring the company's money home.
President Donald Trump, as well as Republican leaders in Congress, have expressed support for a repatriation tax holiday with a one-time rate of 10%. A similar tax holiday was enacted in 2004, and could potentially save Apple about $60 billion.
The bottom line is that if a repatriation holiday takes place, it's a safe bet that Apple won't be sitting on a quarter-trillion-dollar mountain of cash for much longer. Until then, however, Apple feels that repatriation of its foreign profits simply isn't in the company's best interest.

With the market hovering near all-time highs, investors are likely hesitant to start new positions in any high-flying stocks. At times like these, it can be smart to check out some less popular stocks, like those that have underperformed the S&P 500's 7% year-to-date gain.
Three well-known tech stocks appear on that list. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) respectively fell 9% and 8%, while Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) rose just 5%. Let's see why investors are shunning these three stocks, and why it could actually be the right time to buy them.

Image source: Getty Images.

Qualcomm
Over the past few years, mobile chipmaker Qualcomm ceded market share to cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from big OEMs like Huawei. It was also fined in China and South Korea over its wireless patent licensing tactics. In January, the FTC sued Qualcomm, alleging that it leveraged its patent portfolio to marginalize other chipmakers.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) then sued Qualcomm over similar issues and unpaid rebates, then instructed its suppliers to withhold royalty payments from Qualcomm -- which forced the chipmaker to slash its current quarter revenue forecast by $500 million. All these brutal headwinds spooked investors and weighed down Qualcomm's stock.
However, investors should remember that Qualcomm will likely close its $47 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world, later this year. That purchase will enable Qualcomm to evolve into a more diversified chipmaker while strengthening its patent portfolio.
Investors will need to wait a few quarters for those benefits to kick in, but they'll be paid with a solid forward dividend yield of 3.9% in the meantime. Moreover, Qualcomm's current P/E of 20 is well below the industry average of 25 for semiconductor makers -- which should limit its downside potential.
IBM
IBM's revenue has fallen year-over-year for 20 straight quarters, and analysts don't expect that trend to reverse anytime soon. That's because IBM's higher-growth ""strategic imperatives"" businesses (cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security) just aren't growing quickly enough to offset the ongoing slowdowns in its legacy IT services, hardware, and software businesses.

IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. Image source: IBM.

Big Blue is trying to get back on track by divesting weaker businesses and acquiring new ones, but it faces an uphill battle with rivals like Amazon and Microsoft eyeing the same high-growth markets. Even Warren Buffett seemingly lost faith in IBM, announcing that he had sold about 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in IBM back in February.
But looking ahead, IBM's strategic imperatives are still growing, it can acquire more companies to boost its revenue growth, and investing in next-gen technologies -- like quantum computing, blockchain, and AI -- could keep it well ahead of the tech curve. More importantly, it's a cheap stock with a high yield. Its current P/E of 13 is lower than the industry average of 19 for IT services companies, and its forward yield of 3.9% is nearly double the S&P 500's current yield of 2%.

Cisco
Cisco is one of the world's biggest makers of routers and switches. Unfortunately, demand for its networking hardware is drying up due to market commoditization and the rising use of ""white box"" generic hardware running on open source software. Those pressures caused Cisco's revenue growth to remain nearly flat over the past few quarters.

Image source: Cisco.

Cisco is trying to counter that slowdown by investing more heavily in its higher-growth businesses, like cybersecurity, collaboration, and wireless solutions. But just like IBM, those ""faster growing"" businesses just aren't growing fast enough to offset the soft demand for its routers and switches. But over time, these new investments should bear fruit as Cisco gradually evolves from a network hardware vendor to a diversified provider of enterprise software.
That transition will take time, but Cisco's P/E of 16 is much lower than the industry average of 29 for communication equipment vendors, and its forward yield of 3.7% should keep income investors happy. Just like the other two stocks, Cisco's low valuation and high yield should prevent it from falling much further.
But curb your expectations...
Qualcomm, IBM, and Cisco were left out of the market's rally for clear reasons, so investors shouldn't expect them to catch up anytime soon. However, investors who are looking for more conservative dividend plays in a frothy market should take a closer look at all three stocks.

Thursday was another strong day on Wall Street, with major benchmarks posting gains across the board. The S&P 500 reached another all-time high on strength from an upbeat view of the economy and good earnings results from major companies in the retail sector. Although energy prices sagged, investors seemed to focus on the cost savings that consumers would enjoy from cheaper gasoline rather than the profit hit that major oil and natural gas companies might suffer. Still, not every stock participated in the rally, and International Game Technology (NYSE:IGT), Genesco (NYSE:GCO), and Ensco (NYSE:ESV) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.

Shares of International Game Technology fell 13% after the company reported first-quarter financial results that didn't live up to investor expectations. The lottery-game technology specialist saw its sales drop 10% from year-ago levels, and even after accounting for certain extraordinary items, adjusted earnings were well below the consensus forecast among those following the stock. International Game Technology believes that some of its woes were due to the luck of the draw, with fewer major jackpots occurring during the period. Yet some investors are more nervous about IGT's long-term future, especially given that lottery game innovation has seemed to slow in recent years. Without a dramatic boost to the industry, International Game Technology could have trouble making further progress in the months and years ahead.

Genesco makes a misstep
Genesco stock plunged 23% in the wake of the company's downbeat first-quarter results. The maker of footwear and apparel said that revenue fell slightly on a roughly 1% drop in comparable sales, with brick-and-mortar comparable-store sales falling a more precipitous 4%. Genesco blamed the poor performance in part on delayed tax refunds, but even CEO Robert Dennis acknowledged that weak store traffic was also due to difficulties in matching up the company's retail offerings with consumer tastes. A more-than-10% cut to earnings guidance for the full year also contributed to a downbeat attitude among shareholders, and even value investors who see the potential for big gains if Genesco can turn things around seem to want to see more clarity going forward before committing their capital.

Ensco looks for more energy
Finally, shares of Ensco declined nearly 10%. The offshore drilling specialist's drop was roughly in line with what many of its peers in the energy industry suffered today, as the volatile crude oil market again traded down, falling back below the $50-per-barrel level. That's bad news for energy companies generally, but it's especially difficult for Ensco and its offshore peers, because higher energy prices are necessary for many oil and gas exploration and production companies to be able to afford the more extensive capital investments necessary to develop offshore projects profitably. The extent of crude oil's plunge has sent Ensco stock to its lowest levels in decades, and it will take huge efforts from the company to find ways to remain viable if oil prices remain low for the foreseeable future.

As for individual stocks, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Amerco (NASDAQ:UHAL) saw heavy trading following the companies' quarterly earnings announcements.
Best Buy predicts improving sales trends
Best Buy shares soared 21.5% after the electronics retailer paired solid first-quarter results with an optimistic full-year business outlook. Comparable-store sales rose 1.6% to kick off fiscal 2018, reversing the slight decline from the prior-year period. Best Buy managed comparable-sales increases in its consumer electronics, entertainment, and appliances divisions that helped offset a slight decline in its computer and smartphone segment. The online channel contributed healthy gains too, rising 22.5%.
Profit margin ticked higher thanks to solid demand across most of Best Buy's product categories. ""We are pleased today to report strong top and bottom line results,"" Chairman and CEO Hubert Joly said in a press release. ""Our Q1 performance reflects the strength of our customer value proposition and continued momentum in the execution of our strategy,"" he continued.

Executives believe the momentum will carry on into the fiscal second quarter, where sales are expected to grow 1.5% to 2.5%. Non-GAAP earnings will rise to $0.57 to $0.62 per share, which is in line with Wall Street targets. Thanks to the surprisingly strong start to the year, Joly and his team raised their full-year outlook to target 2.5% revenue gains, compared to the prior forecast of a 1.5% uptick.

Amerco takes a big earnings charge
Shares of Amerco, the parent company of U-Haul, dropped 10% after the company posted a sharp drop in fourth-quarter profits. The moving equipment specialist announced healthy demand for do-it-yourself rental trucks and for its self-storage products, as equipment rentals rose 2.3% and storage sales improved 14%. However, a spike in depreciation charges sent net income lower by 82% to just $9.5 million. For the full year, earnings fell to $742 million from $867 million.
Amerco's results were hurt by a broad decline in value for used vehicles that's causing both higher depreciation charges and lower recovery prices when the company sells its older models to make room for fleet improvements. That trend was especially pronounced this year, as Amerco placed 42,000 new trucks in service. ""Increased truck depreciation and reduction in gain on sale of trucks are big drivers of the earnings drop for the year,"" Chairman and CEO Joe Shoen explained in a press release.
Shoen and his team are focused on boosting revenue through increased rental volumes, higher average prices, and increased utilization of its equipment. Its capital charges, meanwhile, should decline in the year ahead as fleet investments fall from $705 million in fiscal 2017 to $440 million in fiscal 2018. The company is still likely to endure increased depreciation costs that pinched reported profits this year, though.

The stock market celebrated Thursday by sending the S&P 500 to a record high. Gains for the major benchmarks varied from a third of a percent to three-quarters of a percent, as investors were generally pleased with signs that the consumer economy in the U.S. continues to move ahead strongly. Solid earnings reports from major retail giants helped to set a positive tone, and even the drop in crude oil prices back down below $50 per barrel wasn't enough to keep the overall market from gaining ground. In addition, good news from other individual companies helped support investor sentiment, and Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD), Aerie Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AERI), and Guess? (NYSE:GES) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Sears satisfies investors with its earnings report
Shares of Sears Holdings climbed 13.5% after the retailer reported its first-quarter financial results. Revenue fell by a fifth to $4.3 billion, and comparable-store sales were down almost 12%, adding to the downward pressure from closures of Sears and Kmart stores. However, the loss of $244 million was only about half what Sears lost in the first quarter of 2016. CEO Eddie Lampert was upbeat about the performance, noting that ""while this was certainly a challenging quarter for our company ... we recognize that we need to accelerate our efforts to improve our operational performance and are moving decisively with our $1.25 billion restructuring program."" Whether the cost savings that result from restructuring efforts prove to be enough to save Sears remains to be seen, but the venerable retailer isn't going to give up without a fight.

Aerie sees its future more clearly
Aerie Pharmaceuticals stock soared by more than a third in the wake of encouraging results from the phase 3 trial of the company's Roclatan treatment for glaucoma. The trial found that Roclatan achieved its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistically superior performance in lowering intraocular pressure compared to the two individual components of the combination therapy. Aerie CEO Vicente Anido Jr. praised the news, arguing that ""with this positive Mercury 2 [study] data, we now have two successful pivotal trials for Roclatan."" With low discontinuation rates for the study, Aerie will have an easier road ahead of it. Relatively few side effects occurred, and investors appear encouraged that the prospects for Aerie's drug are extremely strong going forward.

            });
        

Guess? looks to turn things around
Finally, shares of Guess? gained 14%. The denim specialist reported its fiscal first-quarter results Wednesday night, which included sales growth of 2%. Even though the key Americas retail business continued to struggle through sales declines and profit pressures, better performance overseas helped to offset some of the headwinds that Guess? faced. In addition, the jeans maker boosted its guidance for the full 2018 fiscal year, now expecting sales to climb at a 3.5% to 5% clip. Tough times in the retail sector don't appear to be over just yet, and Guess? is still seeing some pressure with respect to its ability to drive its business forward, especially in the U.S. market. After such a long time of seeing unequivocally bad news, however, even a few signs of hope for Guess? are enough to get some investors excited about the stock once again.

It hasn't been a great year for shareholders of General Electric (NYSE:GE), who have watched as the stock hassignificantly underperformed the S&P 500. Now, CEO Jeff Immelt is under pressure to reassure the investment community that the company is back on track toward its earnings and operational goals, and he sought to do just that with his presentation at the Electrical Products Group conference last week. Let's take a closer look at the key takeaways from the presentation.

GE data by YCharts
1. The target of $2 in operating EPS by 2018 will be tough to hit
Frequent readers of the Fool already know that Immelt's target of $2 per share in operating earnings by 2018 is looking like a stretch; his comments at the presentation reflected the work GE would have to do in order to hit that target. In a nutshell, he said that the $2 target was ""at the high end of the range, and our job now is to take more cost out."" Moreover, he added the caveat that the forecast range assumes stable resource markets. 
While Immelt obviously hasn't abandoned his operating EPS goal, it's clear that he knows achieving it will be far from a walk in the park.
2. There are new objectives to focus on
Immelt redirected investors toward a set of objectives against which they can benchmark GE's progress. Both during the main presentation and the question-and-answer session, he reiterated his expectations for 2018:

Organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5%.
Operating margin expansion of 100 basis points.
Free cash flow conversion from net income of 80% to 90%. 

Regarding all three of these objectives, there are considerations to be made. For example, GE missed its initial organic revenue growth expectations in 2016 as its oil-and-gas-related sales growth was a lot weaker than initially expected. Moreover, there are question marks on whether its power business is facing structural problems.

            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-91326');
            });
        

3. Cost-cutting will be key
Implicit in the expectation for margin expansion is the idea that GE will cut product costs. Immelt outlined ""a couple of big levers"" with which GE can increase margin. Specifically, he discussed GE's H-turbine and the LEAP aircraft engine -- ""[two] of the biggest launches in the history of the company"" -- and how production increases would lead to falling unit costs.
For example, Immelt outlined how an H-turbine's unit cost fell 30% in 2016 and is projected to fall another 10% in 2017, while the unti cost for the LEAP engine (part of a joint venture with France's Snecma) declined 20% in 2016 and is projected to fall another 15% in 2017. 
Cutting costs is clearly a vital objective, as Immelt disclosed that equipment margin had dipped to just 1% in 2016, compared to a historical rate of closer to 5%.
4. So will cash flow generation 
This is a subject of immediate concern for GE; its cash performance in the first quarter was disappointing and indicative of a company facing difficult trading conditions. That said, Immelt reiterated expectations for industrial cash flow of $12 billion to $14 billion in 2017, and going forward, free cash flow conversion from net income is intended to be in the 80% to 90% range.
Discussing the matter, Immelt said: ""I view 2017 as really the last big restructuring year in the company. So this noise is going to kind of come out of the system."" His argument is that the large product launches (such as LEAP and H-turbine mentioned above) and Alstom energy assets integration are using up cash, but cash flow generation would get better going forward.

            });
        

5. The troubles of the oil and gas sector are still a concern
One of the criticisms leveled at Immelt is that he was late to the oil and gas party, and then overpaid for a collection of businesses just ahead of a downturn in fossil fuels. Indeed, last year, GE's oil and gas business delivered a disappointing performance.
As Immelt noted, to hit the $2 EPS target, GE needs resource markets to remain stable. ""Again, we've seen, I would say, the oil and gas markets stabilize,"" he said. ""We see orders improving, but it's off a low base. So I still think we have to underwrite caution in that space.""
Where to next for GE?
Overall, Immelt appeared to be backing away from his target of $2 operating EPS by 2018, and instead guiding investors toward another set of objectives that GE could largely achieve through internal execution (unit cost production cuts, increased cash flow), but that remain contingent on end-market conditions -- particularly in the oil and gas sector.
It was a slightly disappointing, but not completely unexpected, presentation. On a positive note, it may well have reset investor expectations. Clearly, though, GE has much work to do in 2017.

How big do you think Russia's economy is? It must be huge, right?
Just look at a map. In terms of landmass, it's almost twice as large as the second-largest country in the world, Canada.
Yet it turns out that Russia's economy is actually quite small. Its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 was half the size of California's.

Data sources: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Tradingeconomics.com. Chart by author.

You read that right. When it comes to economic might, Russia doesn't even crack the top 10 in the world.
The main reason is that Russia has a smaller population than its landmass would lead one to believe. It takes the ninth spot in the world, with 142 million people, outranked by the likes of Brazil, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. This matters because the size of an economy is dictated by labor and capital. The more of one or both, with all else being equal, the greater the GDP.

On top of this, the sharp drop in oil prices since 2014 has crippled Russia's economy. Its GDP has dropped 40% since the year before energy prices tanked. To put that in perspective, the U.S. economy dropped a maximum of 26% during the Great Depression.

This showdown is definitely a product of the paradigm shift to e-commerce. While most folks would think that ship has sailed, consider that online sales accounted for on just 8% of retail sales in the U.S. for 2016. Excluding cars and fuel from the equation pushed that figure higher to 15.6% of retail sales. Even at that rate, e-commerce still has a long runway ahead. 
Let's look at our contestants. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) provides merchants with a one-stop shop that simplifies the setup and administration of an online store, including a customizable multi-channel e-commerce and payments platform. The company's easy-to-use cloud-based service provides 100 templates and over 1,000 apps to customize the experience.
PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has grown from its roots as the best-known digital-payment method into a full-service payment processor and mobile wallet. The company has partnered will all the major credit card issuers, and its members can choose a funding source for each transaction, either online or in stores.
Both companies provide a vital service in the area of e-commerce, but which company is a better buy now?

In the race for e-commerce, which company has a superior outlook? Image source: Getty Images.

Financial fortitude
It is great to see that both companies have no debt, which gives them a measure of financial flexibility. Shopify's negative net income and free cash flow might be a cause for a greater degree of concern if it hadn't resulted from management's heavy reinvestment to grow the business. Still, Shopify has very little in reserves in the event of unforeseen circumstances or a financial downturn. That could lead to taking on debt or issuing additional stock, which would be dilutive to existing shareholders.

PayPal, on the other hand has a significant amount of cash and is regularly producing more. This advantage puts the company on a much firmer financial footing.
Winner: PayPal.
Recent results and growth prospects
In its most recent quarter, Shopify grew its revenue to $127.4 million, up 75% year over year. At the same time, its monthly recurring revenue increased $20.7 million, up 62% over the prior-year quarter. Gross merchandise volume hit $4.8 billion, up 81% year over year, and gross payments volume increased to $1.8 billion, representing 37% growth over the prior-year quarter. Shopify also exceeded 400,000 merchants for the first time, up 45% from last year.  
During its quarterly financial release, PayPal reported revenue of $2.98 billion, up 17% year over year. Its active customers increased to 203 million, up 11% over the prior-year quarter, while payment transactions increased to 1.7 billion, up 23%. Existing customers are also using the service more, with payments per customer increasing 12% year over year. 
With e-commerce still in its early stages, both companies stand to gain from the evolving demographics, and both have been growing nicely. Shopify has the upper hand, having grown gross merchandise volume by over 100% year over year in six of the seven quarters since going public and sported revenue growth in excess of 86% year over year in every quarter since its debut. 
Winner: Shopify.

Stock performance and valuation
Over the past year, both companies have outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin. PayPal stock is up 34%, more than double that of the index. And Shopify trounced both, with an astonishing return of over 200%.

Data by YCharts
To determine valuation, a number of metrics would normally be used, However, none of the usual metrics are applicable for valuing Shopify. The company is not yet profitable, as it has chosen to plow all it earns and more back into growth, so using a P/E ratio is useless, as is the PEG ratio. It's free cash flow-negative. Measuring price to sales, however, Shopify has a multiple of 18, compared with PayPal's less expensive 5 times trailing sales. Looking forward, Shopify sports a still-high multiple of 13, compared with PayPal's 5 times forward sales.

PS Ratio data by YCharts
So while Shopify stock has posted better returns, PayPal's stock is less expensive.
Winner: Tie.
Final tally
The final tally reveals a tie. Which company to invest in will most likely depend on an investor's disposition. I believe that both companies have the potential to produce market-beating returns over the next several year, which is why I own both. But someone looking for a more risky investment, with a chance of a greater reward, might be more inclined toward Shopify, while an investor looking for less risk and a more secure financial footing will probably be inclined toward PayPal.

How productive has tech giant Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock buyback program been?
The short answer is that it's been extremely effective in enhancing shareholder value since its 2012 inception. The company has wisely spent money scooping up its undervalued shares, reducing shares outstanding and boosting EPS. 
Yet stock repurchases have continued unimpeded in recent quarters, even as the Mac maker's stock price has soared in anticipation of the company's forthcoming redesigned iPhone.

Apple's buybacks continue
In its recent earnings report, Apple supplied a supplemental update to its capital return program. The document shows that the pace of the tech giant's share repurchases continued at full steam during the company's fiscal second quarter. 

Looking back by fiscal year, we see Apple increased the pace of its buybacks by $5 billion dollars in the company's two most recent quarters, even as its stock price continued to climb.

All told, Apple has repurchased a whopping $151 billion in shares since 2012. And in its latest earnings report, Apple's board of directors approved another expansion of its capital return program. The total dollar value allocation now stands at a cool $300 billion, $210 billion of which is earmarked specifically for share repurchases.


Apple's buybacks have been an unequivocal boon to its shareholders since it began. A major reason for that has to do with the fact that Apple shares have been fairly cheap, often at a P/E somewhere in the low-teens in recent years. In fact, Apple's buybacks are plainly the reason that the company's EPS increased 41% over the last five years, much faster than the 14% net income expansion over the same period.
But we have to ask again: With Apple's valuation metrics pushing against all-time highs, could Apple be destroying shareholder value, especially if shares continue to climb?

Are Apple shares still a buy?

Wall Street currently rates Apple stock as a buy, even as shares hover around the consensus 12-month price target of $154.36. 
Yet Apple remains cheaper than the broader market, its P/E multiples remain well below those of the market, at 19 times current earnings and 14 times forward earnings, compared with 25 times earnings for the S&P 500. And that doesn't even back out the massive $158 billion net-cash balanceon Apple's balance sheet. The likely explanation behind the disconnect between Apple's valuation and growth potential lies in its size. As the largest publicly traded company in the world, Apple's sheer size will make growing its top line increasingly difficult in the coming years, though thankfully Apple seems have have plans in place to address this critical issue.


In the medium to long term, Apple is working to establish itself in many of tech's most important future growth markets. Areas like electric vehicles, smart home operating systems and hardware, healthcare, and more are truly massive global market. As just one example, the global automotive industry drives as much as $2 trillion in annual economic output. If Apple can grab even a fraction of some of such a market, it could dramatically increase the company's sales and profit bases. And in the short term, of course, the coming iPhone 8 should trigger a wave of upgrades and new purchases that will improve Apple's financial performance even further.
Truth is, investors only really have to worry about companies buying back shares if the stock is trading at an unsustainable valuation. With Apple, the story has always been management smartly buying up undervalued shares and boosting core financials. It doesn't look like that will change any time soon.

All told, Apple has repurchased a whopping $151 billion in shares since 2012. And in its latest earnings report, Apple's board of directors approved another expansion of its capital return program. The total dollar value allocation now stands at a cool $300 billion, $210 billion of which is earmarked specifically for share repurchases.


Apple's buybacks have been an unequivocal boon to its shareholders since it began. A major reason for that has to do with the fact that Apple shares have been fairly cheap, often at a P/E somewhere in the low-teens in recent years. In fact, Apple's buybacks are plainly the reason that the company's EPS increased 41% over the last five years, much faster than the 14% net income expansion over the same period.
But we have to ask again: With Apple's valuation metrics pushing against all-time highs, could Apple be destroying shareholder value, especially if shares continue to climb?

Are Apple shares still a buy?

Wall Street currently rates Apple stock as a buy, even as shares hover around the consensus 12-month price target of $154.36. 
Yet Apple remains cheaper than the broader market, its P/E multiples remain well below those of the market, at 19 times current earnings and 14 times forward earnings, compared with 25 times earnings for the S&P 500. And that doesn't even back out the massive $158 billion net-cash balanceon Apple's balance sheet. The likely explanation behind the disconnect between Apple's valuation and growth potential lies in its size. As the largest publicly traded company in the world, Apple's sheer size will make growing its top line increasingly difficult in the coming years, though thankfully Apple seems have have plans in place to address this critical issue.


In the medium to long term, Apple is working to establish itself in many of tech's most important future growth markets. Areas like electric vehicles, smart home operating systems and hardware, healthcare, and more are truly massive global market. As just one example, the global automotive industry drives as much as $2 trillion in annual economic output. If Apple can grab even a fraction of some of such a market, it could dramatically increase the company's sales and profit bases. And in the short term, of course, the coming iPhone 8 should trigger a wave of upgrades and new purchases that will improve Apple's financial performance even further.
Truth is, investors only really have to worry about companies buying back shares if the stock is trading at an unsustainable valuation. With Apple, the story has always been management smartly buying up undervalued shares and boosting core financials. It doesn't look like that will change any time soon.

Growth stocks tend to be volatile, especially during earnings season. That's why it isn't uncommon for companies -- even large ones -- to rise or fall dramatically during the course of a single month.
May was no exception. Dozens of stocks from the S&P 500 jumped or fell by double-digits during the month. Here's a closer look at three companies from the famous index -- Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) -- that put up the biggest gains.

The transition is taking holding
Shares of Autodesk rose more than 24% in May in response to producing an upbeat earnings report. The maker of architecture, engineering, and media software posted total quarterly revenue of $485.7 million. While this figure was down 5% when compared to the year-ago period, it was comfortably ahead of what Wall Street had predicted. The quarterly non-GAAP net loss of $0.16 per share was also better than expected.
Autodesk's top line has been under pressure as it transitions its business model away from one-time license sales and toward a software-as-a-service model. While this change provides the company with a recurring stream of revenue, it also delays recognition while having a negative affect the top line. Traders looked right past the revenue dip and instead chose to focus on the 233,000 subscription customers that were adding during the quarter. 
Turning to the full year, management predicted that its recurring revenue base would increase by 24% to 26% as it plans on growing its subscriber base by at least 600,000 users. That news pleased Wall Street and triggered two analysts upgrades. Given all of the positivity, it is easy to understand why shares took off.
The power of low expectations
2017 was predicted to be a bad year for solar companies, but First Solar's first-quarter results painted a different picture. Sales rose by 2% to $891 million, and the company produced a small profit of $0.09 per share. These figures were far ahead of the $668 million in revenue and the net loss of $0.13 analysts had predicted. 
First Solar's management team also said that its first quarter was so strong it was raising its full-year guidance. The new range calls for $2.9 billion in sales at the midpoint, which is up $50 million from its prior outlook. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS is expected to land between $0.25 to $0.75, which also bested expectations. Taken together, the company's upbeat first-quarter results and raised guidance caused shares to rally more than 25% in May. 
There's little doubt that this good news took the markets by surprise. First Solar's stock has been heavily shorted, which is a big reason shares have been under pressure. However, it now appears that 2017 is going to be a much better year for solar manufacturers than many had expected. If the negative sentiment continues to abate, then First Solar's stock might be in a great position to post a strong recovery.

Firing on all cylinders
Standing in direct contrast to First Solar, optimism abounds for the graphics card maker NVIDIA. The company's stock has been red-hot over the past year as demand for its chips continues to be strong in all of the market segments in which it competes. That optimism has stretched NVIDIA's valuation, which amps up the pressure on the company to continue to deliver blow-out results.
In spite of the tension, NVIDIA came through for investors when it reported on May 9: Total revenue jumped 48% to $1.94 billion, while EPS jumped 126% to $0.79.  These numbers easily surpassed the $1.91 billion in revenue and $0.66 in EPS that Wall Street had expected. The beat caused a double-digit rally on the day of the release, and traders have since bid up the company's stock more than 34% since May 1.
NVIDIA credited the big gains to surging demand from gamers and data center operators. Meanwhile, revenue from its auto business also continues to hum along. In total, the company remains well positioned for even more fast growth as interest in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and self-driving cars continue to build. While that optimism is certainly priced into the stock's valuation, I for one think there are ample reasons for investors to continue to hang on.

",3 Best-Performing Stocks in May
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/31/3-beaten-up-dividend-stocks-are-they-bargains.aspx,2017-05-31,"
So far in 2017, the S&P 500 has gained nearly 8% and the stock market as a whole is hovering near all-time highs. However, not all stocks have done quite so well. Specifically, the real estate and retail sectors have significantly underperformed the market this year. Here's a retailer and two real estate investment trusts with retail-based business models, all of which have lost more than 25% of their value this year -- and now look like bargains.

^SPX data by YCharts.
1. Tanger Factory Outlets
Real estate investment trust (REIT) Tanger Factory Outlets (NYSE:SKT) owns 44 outlet shopping centers in 22 U.S. states and Canada, and has gotten crushed so far in 2017.

Image source: Getty Images.

However, Tanger Outlets is a different kind of retail. Specifically, outlet malls offer customers bargains that are difficult to find online, making them less vulnerable to e-commerce than other types of retail. Also, since the businesses occupying Tanger's space are discount-oriented, they work well in any economic environment, making the company recession-resistant. As CEO Steven Tanger says, ""In good times people love a bargain, and in tough times, people need a bargain.""
The proof is in the numbers. Tanger's properties are 98% occupied, and have remained above 95% regardless of what the economy was doing. The company has grown its profits consistently, and as a result, has been able to increase its dividend nearly every year since its IPO in 1993.
Finally, consider the growth potential. Outlet retail is still in its early stages. There are less than 70 million square feet of outlet space in the U.S. (several retail REITs own more space than this all by themselves  see Kimco below), and many potentially valuable U.S. markets are currently not being served at all by the outlet industry.
2. Macy's
Shares of department store retailer Macy's (NYSE:M) have gotten pummeled lately. Many retailers are struggling right now, and Macy's profits haven't exactly been immune.
However, now that it trades for just over seven times this year's expected earnings, it may be worth a look. My Foolish colleague Adam Levine-Weinberg recently wrote an excellent breakdown of Macy's turnaround plan, but in a nutshell, the company is closing underperforming stores, investing in brand exclusivity, and taking steps to create a more pleasant shopping experience in its stores.
Macy's could certainly benefit from some of the same factors that have made Best Buy such a successful turnaround story. For example, Best Buy has done a fantastic job of creating a more engaging and enjoyable shopping experience, with features like its Apple and Samsung stores-within-a-store. As I mentioned, Macy's is also taking steps to improve its shopping experience, which could produce a similar ""destination"" effect.
And as the strongest brick-and-mortar retailer in its specialization, Best Buy was able to survive and pick up much of the market share of weaker competitors (specifically Circuit City, Radio Shack, and h.h. gregg) that didn't make it through the tougher times. As one of the strongest department store retailers, I can see a similar outcome for Macy's.

            });
        

3. Kimco Realty
Shopping center REIT Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM), like the two other stocks mentioned here, hasn't performed too well in 2017. And it certainly makes sense, as many retailers that primarily operate in shopping centers -- such as Kmart, h.h. gregg, and Payless Shoe Source -- have all announced massive store closures in 2017.
However, the impact on Kimco has been minimal -- in fact, the loss due to these closures represents just 0.3% of Kimco's rental income.
Kimco's strategy is to operate in a little over 20 core markets, and to maintain a high level of tenant diversity. Kimco has 517 properties containing 84 million square feet of space, and 80% of the rent they generate is in these core markets. No more than 3.5% of the company's revenue comes from any single tenant, and the top tenants are made up of recession- and e-commerce-resistant businesses.
For example, discount retailers such as TJX, Ross Stores, Wal-Mart, and Dollar Tree, all of which are among Kimco's top 15 tenants, tend to do just fine during tough times, as customers seek bargains. Retailers such as Albertsons and PetSmart sell things people need, not just things people want. These are just a few examples of Kimco's roughly 4,000 individual tenants, but the point is that the company isn't too vulnerable to traditional, discretionary retail businesses closing stores.

How big do you think Russia's economy is? It must be huge, right?
Just look at a map. In terms of landmass, it's almost twice as large as the second-largest country in the world, Canada.
Yet it turns out that Russia's economy is actually quite small. Its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 was half the size of California's.

Data sources: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Tradingeconomics.com. Chart by author.

You read that right. When it comes to economic might, Russia doesn't even crack the top 10 in the world.
The main reason is that Russia has a smaller population than its landmass would lead one to believe. It takes the ninth spot in the world, with 142 million people, outranked by the likes of Brazil, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. This matters because the size of an economy is dictated by labor and capital. The more of one or both, with all else being equal, the greater the GDP.

On top of this, the sharp drop in oil prices since 2014 has crippled Russia's economy. Its GDP has dropped 40% since the year before energy prices tanked. To put that in perspective, the U.S. economy dropped a maximum of 26% during the Great Depression.

",A Foolish Take: Russia's Surprisingly Small Economy
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/30/heres-why-the-worst-may-be-yet-to-come-for-qualcom.aspx,2017-05-30,"
Few large-cap companies have had as grueling a last three years as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
Hit by a raft of fines and court cases the world over, Qualcomm stock has underperformed its benchmark, the Nasdaq Composite, by a whopping 55% over this time frame:

QCOM data by YCharts.
To be sure, the company has attempted to counter the seemingly permanent stream of bad news. However, cautious investors may want to think twice before purchasing Qualcomm stock, as the road ahead still appears fraught with risk for the mobile-chip giant.
Two ways to look at Qualcomm's legal woes
Qualcomm's legal headaches are, perhaps, best examined through two lenses: potential fines, and possible required changes to its patent-licensing practices.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-46663');
            });
        


First, and far less daunting, the possible financial sting would hurt but not kill Qualcomm. In fact, we can use Qualcomm's history of antitrust fines to estimate a plausible range of future costs, then apply them to the company's many ongoing legal battles.
We know Qualcomm already paid $975 million to settle an antitrust case with Chinese regulators in 2015. Similarly, South Korean regulators also fined Qualcomm $853 million at the end of 2016, though the company has yet to pay this, as it plans to challenge the ruling. So admitting a fair degree of imprecision here, we can reach a ballpark estimate that Qualcomm's fines may run about $1 billion each.
Since at last count Qualcomm had four anti-competitive legal cases underway -- South Korea, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the European Union, and Apple -- we can estimate that Qualcomm's legal fees might clock in somewhere around $4 billion, assuming that no more arise in the near future.
Qualcomm carried about $30 billion in cash and investments as of its most recent earnings report, though a large portion of it was likely earmarked for Qualcomm's pending $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductor. However, given its ability to tap debt markets, Qualcomm can probably afford to meet its legal bills, barring some unexpectedly high fee from regulators.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-66823');
            });
        


This brings up the second, more ambiguous, and possibly more pernicious aspect of Qualcomm's legal issues: possible alterations to its patent-licensing terms. Though these are difficult to handicap, investors need to be aware that Qualcomm has been forced to modify its patent-licensing fees in the past; it did so as part of its settlement with Chinese regulators. This didn't materially affect Qualcomm; its revenues actually increased in China from 2015 to 2016.
However, the fact that Qualcomm's core business driver could possibly see its profit model weaken is absolutely essential for any prospective investor to realize, even if it's hard to apply a possible dollar value to this unseemly outcome.

Qualcomm stock is both cheap and risky
So given all the risk clouding its business outlook, it should come as no surprise that Qualcomm stock has been bid down to temptingly cheap levels. For context, here's a quick snapshot of the beleaguered chipmaker's valuation metrics:


Current P/EForward P/EDividend Yield



19.9
14.6
3.6%



Data source: Yahoo! Finance. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-85438');
            });
        


These metrics compare quite favorably to the market averages; the S&P 500 currently sports a P/E of 25 and a 1.9% dividend yield. However, given all the uncertainty surrounding Qualcomm, is this kind of discount to the market justified, or does it reflect an opportunity for investors?
Turning to the analyst community as a possible guidepost, the average of sell-side estimates expect Qualcomm's sales to fall 3.4% this year and rise 0.6% in 2018. More concerning still, they forecast its earnings per share to fall roughly 5% this year and 4% next year -- far from cataclysmic, but certainly not ideal.
Given the lack of clarity surrounding Qualcomm, it's extremely difficult to get a sense of what the future holds for the company's financial performance and, by extension, its share price. However, if the current lawsuits produce fines are limited to expectations discussed above, Qualcomm stock will likely have been an attractive buy in retrospect. On the other hand, since it's so hard to predict the most likely result for Qualcomm, investors might be best served by simply focusing their efforts on less risky areas of the tech industry until more evidence emerges.

",Here's Why the Worst May Be Yet to Come for Qualcomm Inc.

The market got the week off on the wrong foot on Tuesday, as major benchmarks posted declines of as much as 0.25%. After a run of all-time highs, many market participants were comfortable with the pause in the recent upsurge, while others appeared to be more comfortable waiting for signs of strength or weakness from the U.S. economy. With important economic data due out over the next couple of weeks, investors will need to assess the likelihood of the Federal Reserve further tightening its monetary policy at its June Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
In addition to Fed worries, some companies reported less-than-stellar news, and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL), and Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Did Ambarella get left out?
Shares of Ambarella fell 7% after getting a downgrade from an analyst company amid speculation that a key customer of the camera and video-chip specialist's products might be looking for alternative sources for similar products. Analysts at Pacific Crest Securities cut their rating on the stock from overweight to sector weight, and they suggested that despite Ambarella's potential for growth connected to autonomous driving technology, the share price has already moved higher to reflect those prospects. With competition moving into the video-chip sector to pose a threat to Ambarella in the drone, body camera, and security arenas, some investors believe that declines like this could become more common for the company in the near future.

Whiting gets the energy taken out of it
Whiting Petroleum was another victim of negative views from Wall Street, as the stock fell almost 9% following a move from Goldman Sachs to downgrade shares of the energy company. Goldman cut its rating on Whiting stock from neutral to sell, citing the latest drop in crude oil prices back below the $50-per-barrel mark as a major problem that will jeopardize profitability and potential access to capital markets in the future. Some energy bulls had hoped that the countries in the OPEC cartel would choose to make more dramatic production cuts in order to support oil prices, but the market perceived what cuts OPEC did make as being too stingy to make a big difference. Until better times emerge in the energy sector, Whiting could have trouble regaining its lost momentum.

Cal-Maine lays a goose egg
Finally, shares of Cal-Maine Foods dropped 7.5%. The egg producer had its rating reduced by analysts at Cleveland Research, taking their view on the stock from neutral to underperform. The analyst company also set a $30 price target on the stock, which is more than 20% below where Cal-Maine closed Tuesday. The company has seen extensive volatility over the past year, as record results following an avian-flu outbreak among its competitors have finally given way to more normal industry conditions. Now that producers have boosted supply, egg prices have weakened considerably, and that is likely to put pressure on Cal-Maine and its industry rivals for the foreseeable future until the market reaches a new equilibrium. With investors having to make do with no dividend under Cal-Maine's variable payout policy, those who own shares of Cal-Maine will have to hope for a quick rebound in the egg market to help drive future growth.

A stock index is a way to evaluate the performance of part or all of the stock market, typically by assessing the average behavior of the stocks that make up that index. But stock indices aren't just useful as a measurement tool; they can be a powerful investment tool as well.
Index mutual funds and ETFs seek to mirror the performance of a particular stock index by holding the stocks that make up that index. Because the index simply tracks a certain set of stocks, there's much less need for the fund manager to get actively involved in trading decisions, so fees and commissions are typically far lower than fees and commissions in an ""actively managed"" mutual fund -- and index funds have far fewer transactions as well, meaning you'll save on capital gains taxes.
All in all, deciding to go with an index fund is the easy part; the challenge is figuring out which index would be the best one for you to follow. Here's a list of some of the most significant indices and why you might want to choose each.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is one of the oldest stock indices and is still one of the most widely used today. It tracks the stocks of 30 of the largest and most influential businesses in the US, which currently includes Apple, ExxonMobil, McDonald's, and Walt Disney.
The Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning that component stocks with higher share prices are given more weight than the lower-priced stocks. Because the Dow consists entirely of very large, established businesses, it's a good choice to follow for someone who is looking for blue-chip companies to invest in. The Dow makes up roughly 1/4th of the entire US stock market, and it tends to fluctuate in sync with the market as a whole.

Nasdaq Composite Index
The NASDAQ (NASDAQ: NDAQ) is a stock exchange that emphasizes technology stocks, and the Nasdaq Composite Index includes every stock on this exchange.
Unlike the Dow, it's a market-capitalization-weighted index, meaning that the stocks in this index are weighted by the total dollar value of each company's shares. Thus, bigger companies are given more weight than smaller ones.
Like the exchange it's based on, the Nasdaq Composite Index has a heavy emphasis on technology and biotech stocks, but also includes some stocks from other sectors, including financial, transportation, and industrial stocks. It also includes some penny stocks. Thus, an index fund following the Nasdaq Composite Index will do well when the technology sector as a whole thrives. If you're looking for a fund based on the technology sector, this index is a good one to choose.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-4082');
            });
        

Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500)
The first-ever index fund (the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NYSEMKT: VOO)) used the S&P 500 as its index.  The S&P 500 tracks the performance of 500 of the most widely traded stocks in the United States and makes up about 80% of the value of the entire US stock market.
This index is a market-capitalization-weighted index, and includes stocks from a wide range of sectors. The S&P 500 tends to move in line with the market as a whole even more closely than the Dow, so it's a great choice for investors looking for an index that will mirror the entire US stock market's behavior. 
The Russell 2000
The Russell 2000 (RUSSELLINDICES:^RUT) index is a subset of the Russell 3000 index. The Russell 3000 tracks the largest publicly traded companies in the US market; the Russell 2000 tracks the 2000 smallest companies within the Russell 3000. Thus, the Russell 2000 index has become a widely used benchmark for the performance of smaller US companies, also known as small-cap stocks.
Small-caps tend to be more volatile than large-caps, but they also tend to perform slightly better over the long haul. An investor looking for an index fund or ETF that will have slightly higher risk but will maximize potential returns should consider one following the Russell 2000 index.

            });
        

Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, Far East (MSCI EAFE) Index
The MSCI EAFE (NYSEARCA: EFA), unlike the previously mentioned indices, tracks the stocks of non-US- based companies. Specifically, it tracks stocks of companies based in Europe, Australasia, and the Far East. This index includes the most developed regions outside of North America, with countries that tend to have stable governments and economies in line with the US's. Thus, index funds that track this index provide a relatively low-risk way to invest internationally.
All of the above?
Diversification is the key to minimizing risk and maximizing returns over the long haul. Investing in index funds rather than individual stocks is a step in the right direction, but you can diversify further by choosing two or three different indices to invest in.
Selecting indices that reflect widely varying types of stocks will help protect you from poor performance in one sector or region of the market. For example, choosing a Dow index fund and an S&P 500 index fund won't really help you diversify because those indices tend to behave similarly. But if you choose a Dow index fund and a Russell 2000 index fund, you'll be doing a much better job at diversifying: the Dow tracks very large companies while the Russell 2000 tracks small-cap companies. Throw in an international index fund as well, and your diversification will become global. Whatever the economy throws at you, such a well-diversified portfolio will help you to survive unscathed.

Financial stocks attracted heavy investor interest, and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) trailed the broader market by falling slightly. Gold prices ticked higher to help the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEMKT:GDX) rise 1.5%.
As for individual stocks, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) saw heavy trading following the companies' quarterly earnings announcements.

Intuit raises expectations
Intuit shares advanced 7% to a new high after the software giant posted surprisingly strong fiscal third-quarter earnings numbers and raised its 2017 outlook. Revenue jumped 10% during the critical tax season period as the company achieved its market share goals while expanding its base of self-employed customers using its QuickBooks products. ""This was another strong quarter for Intuit, with a hard-fought tax season delivering the revenue we promised along with continued momentum in our QuickBooks franchise,"" Chairman and CEO Brad Smith said in a press release.

Operating profit improved due to the rising proportion of high-margin subscription sales. That boost allowed the company to post $3.90 per share of adjusted earnings to edge past consensus estimates that were calling for $3.87 per share.
Smith and his executive team increased their guidance for the full fiscal year that ends in July. Revenue is now expected to rise by as much as 10% to between $5.13 billion and $5.15 billion. Intuit's prior forecast had targeted a range of $5 billion to $5.1 billion. The profit outlook is brightening, too, with operating income expected to be between $1.36 billion and $1.38 billion, up from the prior range of $1.33 billion to $1.38 billion.

Tiffany's slow start to the year
Tiffany stock fell 9% following the release of the luxury retailer's quarterly results, which showed its continuing struggle with returning to sales growth. Comparable-store sales fell 4% in the key U.S. region thanks to declining demand from both foreign tourists and local shoppers. Tiffany endured minor comps drops in each of its other geographic regions (Europe, Japan, and Asia-Pacific). On the bright side, gross profit margin improved by nearly a full percentage point to 62% of sales thanks to falling raw material costs and increased demand for premium jewelry products.
Executives were satisfied with the broader trends, even as they hope to improve on them in the coming quarters. ""While these results modestly exceeded our near-term expectations,"" Chairman and interim CEO Michael Kowalski said in a press release, ""we are focused on executing long-term strategies to achieve stronger and sustainable performance through product introductions, optimization of our store base, effective marketing communications and the delivery of experiences that resonate with our customers.""
Management affirmed its outlook for low-single-digit sales growth in 2017, which would mark the company's first expansion since 2014. Falling expenses and costs should help earnings rise at a faster pace so that it improves on last year's $3.55 by nearly 10%.
That result would produce Tiffany's biggest annual profit on record. However, with the first quarter kicking 2017 off with sales declines, the stakes are rising for the retailer to outperform during the upcoming holiday season.

Wednesday was a good day for stocks, and the Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 both climbed through milestone levels. Most market participants attributed the positive sentiment to the Federal Reserve, which released the minutes of its latest monetary policy meeting during the afternoon. The central bank revealed plans to clamp down on the size of its balance sheet, which it initially expanded in the aftermath of the financial crisis to provide liquidity to the bond market and additional stimulus to the U.S. economy. Investors were pleased that the Fed believes that it's no longer necessary to extend that level of monetary accommodation to the economy. In addition, some individual companies had extremely good news, and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), Triumph Group (NYSE:TGI), and Puma Biotechnology (NASDAQ:PBYI) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Abercrombie & Fitch looks at a potential buyout
Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch climbed 6% in the wake of reports that the teen retailer might receive an acquisition bid from a consortium of investors. According to The Wall Street Journal (subscription required), industry peer American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) and private equity company Cerberus Capital Management are looking at putting together a potential buyout offer for Abercrombie & Fitch, following speculation that other players in the industry might also be interested in consolidation. A&F has been dealing with takeover speculation for a while, and it has typically noted that any discussions wouldn't necessary translate into actual offers. Yet with Abercrombie set to release its first-quarter financial results Thursday, investors will want to see signs that the company can take care of its challenges on its own -- or else they'll start clamoring more loudly for a buyout to take place.

Triumph reports earnings, resolves dispute
Triumph Group stock soared over 30% after the company announced its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results and resolved a dispute with aircraft manufacturer Bombardier. The aerospace components and systems specialist said that sales fell 13% from year-ago levels, and it posted a GAAP loss of $126.8 million. With challenges in its aerospace structures business, Triumph has focused on amending contracts and addressing operational and financial challenges, and the company's transformation plan has led to improving free cash flow and cost savings. Investors were also happy that Triumph reached a settlement of all of its disputes with Bombardier. Triumph said that the agreement ""resets the commercial relationship between [Triumph] and Bombardier and allows each of them to better achieve their business objectives going forward.""

Puma gets a thumbs-up
Finally, shares of Puma Biotechnology jumped 30%. The biopharmaceutical company earned a hoped-for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel looking at its neratinib candidate treatment for breast cancer. The panel voted 12 to 4 in favor of recommending the drug to the FDA, and although panelists expressed some thoughts about potentially limiting the size of the group of women eligible to use the drug, investors nevertheless took the news as a positive. The FDA still needs to make its own decision about Puma's drug, and it isn't bound by the opinion of the advisory panel. Nevertheless, today's recommendation moves Puma one step further to getting a big win under its belt, and shareholders recognized that fact with the second big move in the stock this week.

Mutual funds can be great investing options for people who want the high-growth potential of the stock market, but don't want to choose individual stocks to buy. However, the convenience of mutual funds isn't free -- there are several types of expenses investors may need to pay, and these fees can really eat away at your long-term performance.
The three main types of mutual fund expenses
When you invest in a mutual fund, there are three main expenses you may have to pay. Not all mutual funds have all three expenses, and you can find the details in a fund's prospectus.

Image source: Getty Images.

A front-end sales charge, also called a sales load, refers to money you pay upfront when you invest in a mutual fund. This is a form of commission paid to financial planners, brokers, or investment advisors. If you limit your search to ""no load"" funds, you can avoid this expense altogether.
A back-end sales charge, or back-end load, refers to money you pay when you sell, or redeem, your shares of a mutual fund. This expense can be a flat fee, or can gradually decrease over time to incentivize investors to hold their investments. Like front-end sales charges, these are commissions paid to third parties, and are not a part of the fund's operating expenses.
An expense ratio is the fund's annual operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of assets. Unlike the sales charges, this cost applies to all mutual funds. This covers management fees as well as other expenses of running the mutual fund. For example, a 1% expense ratio means that for every $1,000 you have invested, you'll pay $10 in expenses per year.
You may see two expense ratios listed  gross and net. A fund's gross expense ratio refers to the total annual operating expenses, while the net expense ratio may be reflective of a temporary discount, and may therefore be lower. Simply put, the net expense ratio is what the fund's investors are paying now, while the gross expense ratio is what the fund's expenses could be in the future. As a long-term investor, it's a good idea to base your decisions off of the gross expense ratio  in other words, don't assume that the lower net expense ratio will last forever.
You might be surprised at how much these expenses can really cost
As an example, let's say that you have $10,000 to invest. The S&P 500 has historically averaged returns of about 9.5% per year, and $10,000 compounded at this rate for 30 years is $152,200.
Now, let's say that you invest in a mutual fund that does just as well as the overall market. That is, the fund's investments generate total returns of 9.5% per year on average. However, to invest in this particular fund, you'll need to pay a 3% front-end sales charge, as well as a 1% expense ratio on an ongoing basis.
These may sound like small percentages, but these small fees result in a 30-year investment value of $109,200. In other words, the front-end sales charge and expense ratio reduced your investment gains by $43,000.
With that in mind, here's a calculator to use while you're shopping around for mutual funds that can help you understand the long-term impact of the fees.




 
* Calculator is for estimation purposes only, and is not financial planning or advice. As with any tool, it is only as accurate as the assumptions it makes and the data it has, and should not be relied on as a substitute for a financial advisor or a tax professional.

The Foolish bottom line
To be clear, fees aren't the only thing you should look at when evaluating mutual funds, and funds with lower fees aren't necessarily better than funds that charge a little more.
Specifically, if the fund's performance justifies the cost, it can make perfect sense to pay the fee. For example, one of my personal favorite funds, the Dodge & Cox Stock Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:DODGX) charges a 0.52% expense ratio while another favorite, the Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:VFINX) charges just 0.14%. However, the Dodge & Cox fund has consistently beaten the market, even after fees, throughout the past 50+ years, so this would be a case where the fee was well-justified.
However, this isn't often the case. Before you invest in any mutual fund, be sure the fees you're agreeing to pay are well-justified. If they aren't, you're probably better off looking elsewhere.

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) turned 20 as a public company earlier this month, and the stock is being celebrated for its monstrous game-changing wealth creation. The stock is a 647-bagger since going public at a split-adjusted price of $1.50 on May 15, 1997.
Shares of the leading online retailer opened at another all-time high on Wednesday, and it's easy to wonder when the stock will split again. Amazon is closing in on $1,000, and while these transactions aren't as important as they used to be -- individual investors can buy a share at $1,000 just as easily as they can buy 100 shares of the same stock at $10 -- there are a couple of compelling reasons for the dot-com darling to consider executing what would be its fourth stock split as a public company.

Image source: Amazon.com. 

Party like it's 1999
Amazon went through three stock splits during the sudsy days before the dot-com bubble popped. The company wasn't profitable. It would go on to post a massive $1.4 billion deficit in 2000. However, Amazon was growing, and it was an internet stock at a time when investors valued eyeballs over actual financial results.

6/2/98: 2-for-1 stock split
1/5/99: 3-for-1 stock split
9/2/99: 2-for-1 stock split

Amazon rolled out the three splits in a 15-month window that began a year after its 1997 IPO. It's now been nearly 18 years since its last split, and one would think that lowering its share price in a zero-sum transaction is long overdue. The first three splits were announced when the stock was in the high double-digits, or just crossing into the triple-digits. Why wouldn't it go this route now that it's approaching quadruple-digits? 
The easy explanation is that Amazon doesn't have to declare a stock split. The shares have soared nearly 650-fold, so it's not as if the stock's buoyant share price has been a detriment to capital appreciation. There's also some vanity associated with a chunky share price. It's a sign of success. You can blame Warren Buffett for that, even if he's obviously not as flashy as some of the tech giants that have been racing alongside Amazon.

Splitting headache
Thankfully for folks rooting for a stock split, there are two good reasons for the country's most valuable retailer to consider a split. Let's start with accessibility. Stock commissions are cheaper than they were in the late 1990s, and it's as easy to buy a single share of a stock as it is to buy a round lot of 100 these days. However, with Amazon approaching $1,000, it's a realistic hurdle for some individual investors trying to take advantage of low commissions to initiate positions and diversify within a modest portfolio.
Perhaps the bigger reason to consider a split now -- or at least the moment the stock crosses four figures -- is index inclusion. Amazon is naturally a member of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices, but it's not in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The Dow 30 is a price-weighted index, which, unlike the S&P 500 and most of the other popular market gauges, bases a stock's weighting in the index by its share price. Amazon may have topped Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to command the largest market cap in the retail industry two summer ago, but it's not getting into the Dow at its current price tag. The stock's price of $975.55 at Wednesday's open makes it more than four times as valuable as the stock that is currently the Dow's highest-priced component. More to the point, Amazon's stock price is worth more than its 15 lowest-priced components combined. A percentage move by Amazon stock if it was in the Dow would be more than enough to offset a similar move going the other way for the lower-priced half of the Dow 30. Obviously there are no guarantees that Amazon will be tapped for Dow inclusion if it does execute a stock split, but it's not a coincidence that Apple wasn't added until it finally gave up the race to $1,000 and announced a 7-for-1 split in 2014. 
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos didn't get as far as he did by being conventional. He's not going to buckle to the clamoring for stock splits. However, making the share price more accessible to entry-level investors and opening up the possibility for joining Wal-Mart in the Dow are compelling reasons to consider the move. Let's see if all Amazon needed was to tap the $1,000 finish line before going this route.

It's a sign of success. You can blame Warren Buffett for that, even if he's obviously not as flashy as some of the tech giants that have been racing alongside Amazon.

Splitting headache
Thankfully for folks rooting for a stock split, there are two good reasons for the country's most valuable retailer to consider a split. Let's start with accessibility. Stock commissions are cheaper than they were in the late 1990s, and it's as easy to buy a single share of a stock as it is to buy a round lot of 100 these days. However, with Amazon approaching $1,000, it's a realistic hurdle for some individual investors trying to take advantage of low commissions to initiate positions and diversify within a modest portfolio.
Perhaps the bigger reason to consider a split now -- or at least the moment the stock crosses four figures -- is index inclusion. Amazon is naturally a member of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices, but it's not in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The Dow 30 is a price-weighted index, which, unlike the S&P 500 and most of the other popular market gauges, bases a stock's weighting in the index by its share price. Amazon may have topped Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to command the largest market cap in the retail industry two summer ago, but it's not getting into the Dow at its current price tag. The stock's price of $975.55 at Wednesday's open makes it more than four times as valuable as the stock that is currently the Dow's highest-priced component. More to the point, Amazon's stock price is worth more than its 15 lowest-priced components combined. A percentage move by Amazon stock if it was in the Dow would be more than enough to offset a similar move going the other way for the lower-priced half of the Dow 30. Obviously there are no guarantees that Amazon will be tapped for Dow inclusion if it does execute a stock split, but it's not a coincidence that Apple wasn't added until it finally gave up the race to $1,000 and announced a 7-for-1 split in 2014. 
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos didn't get as far as he did by being conventional. He's not going to buckle to the clamoring for stock splits. However, making the share price more accessible to entry-level investors and opening up the possibility for joining Wal-Mart in the Dow are compelling reasons to consider the move. Let's see if all Amazon needed was to tap the $1,000 finish line before going this route.

",When Will Amazon Split Its Stock Again?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/30/why-ambarella-whiting-petroleum-and-cal-maine-food.aspx,2017-05-30,"
The market got the week off on the wrong foot on Tuesday, as major benchmarks posted declines of as much as 0.25%. After a run of all-time highs, many market participants were comfortable with the pause in the recent upsurge, while others appeared to be more comfortable waiting for signs of strength or weakness from the U.S. economy. With important economic data due out over the next couple of weeks, investors will need to assess the likelihood of the Federal Reserve further tightening its monetary policy at its June Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
In addition to Fed worries, some companies reported less-than-stellar news, and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL), and Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Did Ambarella get left out?
Shares of Ambarella fell 7% after getting a downgrade from an analyst company amid speculation that a key customer of the camera and video-chip specialist's products might be looking for alternative sources for similar products. Analysts at Pacific Crest Securities cut their rating on the stock from overweight to sector weight, and they suggested that despite Ambarella's potential for growth connected to autonomous driving technology, the share price has already moved higher to reflect those prospects. With competition moving into the video-chip sector to pose a threat to Ambarella in the drone, body camera, and security arenas, some investors believe that declines like this could become more common for the company in the near future.

Whiting gets the energy taken out of it
Whiting Petroleum was another victim of negative views from Wall Street, as the stock fell almost 9% following a move from Goldman Sachs to downgrade shares of the energy company. Goldman cut its rating on Whiting stock from neutral to sell, citing the latest drop in crude oil prices back below the $50-per-barrel mark as a major problem that will jeopardize profitability and potential access to capital markets in the future. Some energy bulls had hoped that the countries in the OPEC cartel would choose to make more dramatic production cuts in order to support oil prices, but the market perceived what cuts OPEC did make as being too stingy to make a big difference. Until better times emerge in the energy sector, Whiting could have trouble regaining its lost momentum.

            });
        

Cal-Maine lays a goose egg
Finally, shares of Cal-Maine Foods dropped 7.5%. The egg producer had its rating reduced by analysts at Cleveland Research, taking their view on the stock from neutral to underperform. The analyst company also set a $30 price target on the stock, which is more than 20% below where Cal-Maine closed Tuesday. The company has seen extensive volatility over the past year, as record results following an avian-flu outbreak among its competitors have finally given way to more normal industry conditions. Now that producers have boosted supply, egg prices have weakened considerably, and that is likely to put pressure on Cal-Maine and its industry rivals for the foreseeable future until the market reaches a new equilibrium. With investors having to make do with no dividend under Cal-Maine's variable payout policy, those who own shares of Cal-Maine will have to hope for a quick rebound in the egg market to help drive future growth.

Bank stocks shot up in the immediate wake of the presidential election on hopes that the unexpected victory of a pro-business candidate Donald Trump would spur profitability in the industry. But with the controversies swirling in Washington, D.C., combined with legislative paralysis, investors have begun to reconsider how much banks will actually benefit under the new administration.
The optimism around bank stocks was spurred by two things, in particular. First, Trump vowed on the campaign trail to reduce the top corporate tax rate from 35% down to 15%. That would help banks more than any other industry, as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup all rank among the 10 biggest corporate taxpayers in America.

Bank of America's office in New York City (center). Image source: Getty Images.

For Bank of America, for instance, this would have reduced the North Carolina-based bank's tax liability in 2016 by nearly half, or 48%, leaving $3.5 billion in additional net income to hit the bank's bottom line. That would make a huge difference, boosting Bank of America's net income by 19%, or approximately $0.35 per share, holding all else equal.
To be clear, there's a short-term downside to a tax cut from the perspective of certain big banks -- namely, Bank of America and Citigroup -- which have large deferred tax assets, which would have to be written down if taxes are cut. According to estimates, that would cost Bank of America somewhere in the neighborhood of $4.4 billion. But unlike the benefit, which would be recurring, this downside would hit the bank's balance sheet only once.
In addition to tax cuts, moreover, Trump promised to ease the regulatory burden on banks, which had been ratcheted up ever since the financial crisis. This would lower compliance costs and give banks much more operational flexibility to grow revenue and return capital to shareholders, all of which would boost profitability.

Stocks rose more than 1% last week as first-quarter earnings season started to wind down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) both pushed deeper into record territory and are up 8% and 7%, respectively, so far in 2017.

Investors can still expect volatility around a few businesses that are announcing quarterly numbers in the days ahead. Here's what to watch for in the reports coming from Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), and Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) this week.
Palo Alto's growth pace 
Cybersecurity software specialist Palo Alto Networks will announce its fiscal third-quarter earnings results on Wednesday. Shares are down sharply since the company's last report revealed surprisingly weak sales growth. In early March, CEO Mark McLaughlin cited execution challenges around closing big security deals, which led to lower revenue than Wall Street expected.

Image source: Getty Images.

The team promised to address the issues quickly by adjusting their marketing approach and slowing their product development plans. Yet management forecast another quarter of slowing growth as Palo Alto Networks' expansion pace falls to below 20% from the prior-quarter's 26% pop.
It's possible the software specialist will outperform that conservative outlook, especially given that rival FireEye recently announced healthier operating trends. Shares could remain under pressure, though, if McLaughlin and his team don't show progress at raising product-development productivity and at improving the effectiveness of their sales and marketing processes.
Lululemon's outlook
Lululemon is set to post its quarterly results on Thursday, and Wall Street isn't expecting much good news from the athletic apparel specialist. Despite strong sales growth last quarter, shares sank after the company warned of a slow start to fiscal 2017. In fact, Lululemon's guidance calls for comparable-store sales growth to decelerate to a low-single-digit pace from the prior year's 5% boost .

Image source: Lululemon.

In addition to revenue trends, investors will be paying close attention to inventory levels and profitability this week. Many retailers -- particularly those in the sports-apparel segment -- have reported slowing customer traffic and an increased reliance on sales and promotions.
If Lululemon was hit with the same negative issues, gross profit margin may begin falling again after posting a solid rebound in the last few quarters. That, in turn, would threaten bottom-line earnings, since the company only recently returned to net income growth following three years of declines. Management is currently targeting a slight profit uptick in 2017, but may change that forecast later this week.

Youth-apparel-retailer Five Below posts results on Thursday that should be highlighted by strong sales growth. Due mainly to a quickly expanding store base, Wall Street is expecting revenue to jump 20%, to $230 million. Five Below paired a similar revenue boost last year with increased profitability as operating income rose 23%. ""Our performance in 2016 once again illustrates the strength, consistency and broad appeal of the Five Below model,"" CEO Joel Anderson told investors in late March.
Its growth pace slowed in the holiday quarter, though, as comparable-store sales gains slipped to 1%. Anderson and his team projected a similarly modest gain in the current quarter, and for the full year, too. Yet executives are optimistic that their recent expansion into the massive California market will lay the foundation for accelerating future growth. The retailer aims to add 100 stores to its overall base this year compared to last year's launch of 85 new locations.

Tuesday was another solid day for stocks, and a rising Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all helped sustain positive sentiment toward the prospects for the economy, especially in the U.S. market. Gains for the major benchmarks weren't all that substantial, but they still reflected the overall optimism that Americans have about the current state of affairs. Despite ongoing political and global economic uncertainties, most market participants seemed willing to look on the bright side as they anticipate seeing more economic data over the next week and a half.
Yet some stocks didn't hold up as well as the overall market, and Herbalife (NYSE:HLF), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN), and Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF-A) (NYSE:BF-B) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Herbalife falls on China nervousness
Shares of Herbalife closed down 6% as investors reacted negatively to news of the departure of a key executive in the company's Chinese operations. Li Yanliang, president of the Herbalife China unit, was removed from his role, according to a Chinese news source familiar with the company. Many investors seemed shocked by the move, especially given that Herbalife had seen much faster growth in sales in China than it has in its overall worldwide operations. Even with the pullback, Herbalife stock trades near its best levels in three years, but any lingering questions about the vitally important business in China could cause the stock's recent rally to take a pause until the matter is resolved to investors' satisfaction.

Alexion also sees executive departures
Alexion Pharmaceuticals stock dropped 9% after the company also suffered defections from the corporate suite. The biopharma said that CFO David Anderson, Chief Commercial Officer Carsten Thiel, R&D head Martin Mackay, and Chief Human Resources Officer Clare Carmichael will all be leaving the company, with Thiel and Carmichael's departures effective as of June, Anderson's in August, and Mackay's at the end of 2017. Alexion appointed Brian Goff as Thiel's replacement for chief commercial officer, but the company will have to do a search to fill the other three vacancies. The move comes amid dramatic turnover at Alexion, with CEO Ludwig Hantson having been on the job only since March. Once things settle down among the executive ranks, Alexion could bounce back, but for now, investors don't appear willing to wait and see how things play out.

Brown-Forman has a turbulent day
Finally, shares of Brown-Forman finished the day down 6%. The maker of Jack Daniel's and other spirits saw some wild swings late in the day, with the stock briefly spiking 5% higher on news that Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) was interested in making a takeover bid for its alcohol-industry peer. Yet those gains quickly evaporated when Brown-Forman rebuffed Constellation Brands, saying that it isn't interested in making a sale. The downward move gave up all of Brown-Forman's share-price gains from Monday, which had gone largely unexplained at the time. Given the power of the Jack Daniel's brand, it's entirely possible that Constellation could be back with a higher offer at some point in the future.

The stock market continued to gain ground on Tuesday, with major benchmarks rising back toward key levels. The S&P 500 finished the day just below the 2,400 mark, and the Dow remains close to 21,000. Market participants pointed to the Trump administration's budget proposals as having no real surprises, and they were generally satisfied with the lack of drama surrounding its release. At the same time, several individual companies had good news that helped keep the mood on Wall Street positive. Diana Shipping (NYSE:DSX), AK Steel (NYSE:AKS), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Diana ships a solid quarter
Shares of Diana Shipping climbed 8% in the wake of the release of the company's first-quarter earnings report. The shipping company saw revenue rise slightly, and Diana's net loss narrowed a bit from year-ago levels. More encouraging was the fact that the size of Diana's fleet grew, and average daily charter rates were up 14% even as daily average operating expenses fell by more than 11% from where they were during the first quarter of 2016. Investors following the shipping company had expected wider losses, but the real question facing Diana Shipping is whether the global economy will recover adequately to restore international shipping volumes to past levels. If that happens, then better industry conditions could lift Diana shares a lot further.

AK Steel gets a key sign-off
AK Steel stock strengthened by 9% after getting good news from a regulatory agency. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration had been investigating allegations of hazardous conditions at the Middletown Works worksite, with a March letter to the agency stating that hazards included a lack of certification among welders and the failure to keep welding logs for certification purposes. AK Steel responded at the time that it had indeed certified almost 200 of its workers as welders, and OSHA concluded that the case should be closed because the hazardous conditions alleged did not in fact exist. That's good news for a company that has already had plenty of other things to worry about, including difficult industry conditions and competitive efforts from other steelmaking rivals.

Take-Two posts winning earnings
Finally, shares of Take-Two Interactive climbed over 5%. The video-game maker released its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results Tuesday morning, which included full-year revenue gains of 26% and a 19% rise in bookings from the company. For the fourth quarter alone, sales jumped by more than half on strength in key franchise offerings, including Mafia, Grand Theft Auto, and various sports-related offerings. The results were even strong enough to offset the bad news that Red Dead Redemption 2 won't be released until next April at the earliest, which will mean that Take-Two won't see any positive impact from the release during the coming fiscal year. As entertainment options continue to perform strongly, it'll be important for Take-Two to keep up the pace and continue to deliver the new game offerings that its customers want. If it does, though, further share-price gains are possible.

""It's simple math,"" she said. ""$100,000 is less than $150,000 -- it's like earning a free $50,000.""
My wife and I were being pitched a timeshare.
Our salesperson was offering a value proposition she thought was unbeatable: If we paid $100,000 for this timeshare, we'd save roughly $150,000 (she was rounding) in lodging costs over the next 20 years.
There was only one problem: Her central premise -- that $100,000 is less than $150,000 -- was wrong.

Image source: Getty Images.

A powerful concept
Before you send me back to second-grade math class, let's consider the time value of money: Money today is inherently more valuable than the same amount in the future.
""Obviously,"" you may be thinking to yourself, ""since inflation reduces the value of money in future years. That's why my work gives me that 2% cost-of-living adjustment each year."" So $100 a year from now might only purchase the same amount as $98 today. Which makes $100 today inherently more valuable.
But that's not actually the primary principle at play here -- it's what you can do with that money today to make it grow, so that it will be worth more a year from now.
I'm talking about investing in the stock market.
Over the past 100+ years, the S&P 500 (large-cap U.S. stocks) has returned an average of 7% annually after accounting for inflation.
For me, the key word in the preceding sentence is ""average."" To achieve 7% annual returns, you didn't have to recognize Amazon's potential early, pore through clinical trials to find the best HIV drugs and model out their sales, or shell out $400 for a (sham) day-trading course.
You didn't have to do something brilliant or have great foresight. All you had to do was be average. And invested.
With the advent of the index fund, whose job is to passively track an index (like the S&P 500) and deliver comparable returns, it's easier than ever to get those gains. (In fact, even the world's greatest stock picker recommends it.)
The timeshare salesperson didn't understand (or was ignoring) the time value of money.
$100,000 > $150,000
To demonstrate the power of this principle, let's work the math on that timeshare I was offered. I will show you how $100,000 today is worth a great deal more than $150,000 over the next 20 years.
We came to that $150,000 number because my wife and I usually travel for about three weeks a year -- 21 days -- and expect to spend about $150 a night on hotels. That works out to $3,150 in lodging expenses this year. The travel industry has seen 8% inflation over the last few years, so the salesperson assumed that we'd see that annual inflation permanently over the next 20 years. That level of sustained inflation in discretionary spending is unheard of, but let's just assume it's accurate.
So year one expenses of $3,150 grow 8% in year two to $3,402...all the way to year 20 expenses of $13,594. The sum of spending during those 20 years? $144,150.
Yet $100,000 today is worth more.
Let's say that my wife and I put that $100,000 in the stock market and earn an average of 7% gains per year over the next 20 years. We pay for lodging expenses out of our annual income and don't touch that $100,000 the whole time. Over 20 years, that $100,000 grows to $386,968 before taxes.

If you assume that we sell our index funds and ""cash out"" at the end of year 20, we would likely pay a 15% long-term capital gains tax rate (which is the 2017 rate for married filing jointly households making more than $75,900 and less than $470,701). That leaves us with $328,923, or $184,773 in net extra household cash after we subtract the $144,150 we paid out for lodging expenses.

A massive win for time value of money -- to say nothing of the benefit of vacationing in a bunch of different places without being tied to wherever timeshares exist.

            });
        

But only if you're smart about it
It is so easy to lose most of that extra cash if you don't maximize the time value of money.
Let's pretend, instead, that my wife and I decide that the $100,000 is our travel lodging fund for the next 20 years. If we aren't going to spend it on a timeshare, we'll allocate it to hotels instead. We pay our lodging expenses out of the fund each year, and as a result we have to invest the $100,000 more conservatively and put more money into cash. (After all, you shouldn't invest in stocks with money that you plan to use in the next five years -- who can predict the next market downturn?) We achieve a 4.5% annual growth rate, and as mentioned above, we subtract lodging expenses each year from that fund.
We still end up ahead...but by a lot less (roughly $8,000 instead of $185,000). That's for three reasons:
A) We achieve a lower annual growth rate (4.5% instead of 7%). That reduces our gains by about $146,000.
B) We withdraw money from the fund every year. The loss of that capital compounding reduces things by roughly $58,000.
C) Taxes further reduce our gains. Since we have to pay capital gains taxes each year on the amount that we sell out of the index fund, we pay an effective 15% surcharge every year on that money. That reduces returns by another $30,000 -- which is less than the $58,000 we pay in the scenario above, but only because our returns are so much lower.
Here's how that looks in chart form.

We still come out ahead compared to buying a timeshare -- by roughly $8,375.
Use the time value of money to your advantage
The time value of money doesn't just matter when you're buying a time share -- and it doesn't always work in your favor, either. When you take out a 30-year mortgage, that's three decades of payments and interest accruing against you.
Zillow estimates that the current average house is worth $196,500. Let's say you put 20% down (that's $39,300) and finance the remaining $157,200.
Assuming you're charged a 4% annual interest rate on that loan (roughly average as of the time of this writing), then you'll end up paying a whopping $270,179 over the term of that loan.
The numbers get even uglier if you're paying interest on a credit card.
Time value of money is an incredibly powerful principle. The key is to understand when it's working for -- or against -- you, and what those costs entail.
I'm not saying don't ever buy the timeshare. But go into the timeshare negotiation recognizing what that money could be worth when invested -- and demand a price that makes it worth your while.
Recognize the implicit costs of these money decisions, and don't let some slick salesperson make you forget them. Most importantly, remember that time value of money, when properly used, can do amazing things for your wealth. 



","When ""Simple"" Math Is Wrong"
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/26/why-lions-gate-entertainment-nutanix-and-amtrust-f.aspx,2017-05-26,"
Friday was a quiet end to a strong week for the stock market. Major benchmarks finished very close to the unchanged level, leaving the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all either at or near record highs. Rising tensions on the geopolitical front as a result of the G7 summit in Sicily failed to translate into downward pressure on stocks, and most market participants appear to be optimistic about the prospects for continued outperformance from the U.S. economy. Even in a calm trading session, some stocks were quite strong, and Lions Gate Entertainment (NYSE:LGF-A) (NYSE:LGF-B), Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), and AmTrust Financial Services (NASDAQ:AFSI) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Lions Gate roars ahead
Shares of Lions Gate Entertainment were up 9% after the entertainment studio reported its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results late Thursday. Revenue soared by almost 60% because of the acquisition of premium cable channel operator Starz, and even when you run pro forma numbers based on year-ago results from the two companies separately, adjusted operating income climbed by more than a quarter over the past 12 months. The surprise success of blockbuster La La Land helped to drive much of the performance, but Lions Gate is even happier with the way that it has integrated Starz into its overall operational mix. With the television group posting record revenue, and plenty of promising opportunities ahead, Lions Gate hopes that this is just the beginning of a new upsurge that could take the content producer to the next level in the industry.

Nutanix climbs into the clouds
Nutanix stock rose 11.5% in the wake of the company's release of its fiscal third-quarter financial report. The enterprise cloud-computing specialist said that revenue jumped by two-thirds from year-ago levels, and although the company posted a wider net loss than it did in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, investors nevertheless were pleased that there wasn't even more red ink from Nutanix. CEO Dheeraj Pandey noted that the results ""reflect our continued focus on the Global 2000 [list of large businesses] as well as a measurable improvement in the number of larger deals in the quarter, particularly in North America."" With ongoing enterprise demand for cloud-computing services showing no signs of letting up, Nutanix should be able to use its positive momentum to capture future growth as well.

            });
        

AmTrust Financial gets a vote of confidence
Finally, shares of AmTrust Financial Services finished higher by 12.5%. The beleaguered insurance company got an infusion of cash from family members of certain corporate insiders, including CEO Barry Zyskind and board member George Karfunkel. The private placement involved the sale of 24.1 million shares of stock at $12.45 per share, bringing in $300 million. Shareholders took the move as a vote of confidence in the company's future prospects, despite controversy surrounding the company and its practices. Today's jump makes the Zyskind and Karfunkel families big winners, giving them more than $36 million in profits in a single day on their newest purchases.

Ford gets a new boss
Ford shares rose 2% after the automaker announced a major executive shakeup. CEO Mark Fields is out, to be replaced by Jim Hackett, who previously led a turnaround at office environment specialist Steelcase.
Hackett is tasked with laying the groundwork for Ford to compete in an industry that's likely to look much different in a decade thanks to several disruptions already playing out, including ride-sharing, and the rising popularity of fully electric and autonomous vehicles. The incoming CEO will also need to oversee a revamping of the company's innovation and production processes to speed up development with tools such as artificial intelligence and big data, the company explained in a press release.
""Jim Hackett is the right CEO to lead Ford during this transformative period for the auto industry and the broader mobility space,"" Board of Directors President Bill Ford said .

Image source: Ford.

Ford's latest results showed that its immediate concerns include falling sales volumes and lower market share in its core U.S. division. Profit in that segment is on track to drop in 2017 as the company ramps up spending on growth prospects such as electric and self-driving vehicles.  The company recently announced plans to reduce its workforce to make room for that investment surge. However, this week's leadership reboot suggests the board of directors didn't think the move went far enough.

Booz Allen issues an aggressive outlook
Consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton rose 7% after posting surprisingly strong fiscal fourth-quarter results. Revenue rose 11% to $1.58 billion to edge past consensus estimates that were targeting $1.57 billion. A 24% spike in operating income, meanwhile, helped push adjusted earnings up to $0.45 per share, which was better than the $0.43 per share Wall Street was expecting.

In a press release, management cited strong demand for its services recently, including a 15% boost in its backlog. Booz Allen this quarter enjoyed its highest ratio of billed contracts yet.
""The great fiscal year 2017 results we report today,"" CEO Horacio Rozenski said in a press release, ""demonstrate success that has been built by the people of Booz Allen over the past several years."" Executives are ""proud of our position as the government services industry's organic revenue growth leader and our long record of success in delivering value to investors,"" Rozenski continued .
Booz Allen issued a bullish outlook for the coming fiscal year that sees revenue climbing by between 4% and 7% to as much as $6.21 billion, as earnings improve to between $1.79 per share and $1.89 per share. Wall Street had been expecting slightly higher earnings but a significantly weaker sales bounce to $6.02 billion. 
",What Happened in the Stock Market Monday
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/14/a-lot-of-investors-are-still-shorting-chipotle-mex.aspx,2017-05-14,"
Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is officially on the other side of the food-borne illness outbreaks that caused customers to shun its restaurants over the past two years, and caused its stock to lose half its value. Yet it's still one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the S&P 500.
A little less than 16% of Chipotle's outstanding shares have been sold short in expectation of its stock falling. That's down from more than 20% at the end of last year, but it's still high for a large-cap stock that's almost certain to climb as it continues to put its 2015 food safety issues in the rear-view mirror.

CMG Percent of Shares Outstanding Short data by YCharts.
Chipotle has the ninth-highest short interest on the S&P 500, at five times the index's average level.
Shorting Chipotle's stock was a good bet a year ago, and an even better bet a year and a half ago, but it most certainly isn't anymore. Chipotle's shares have climbed 30% this year on the back of markedly improved numbers.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-96944');
            });
        


In the first three months of this year:

Revenue increased 28.1% compared to the year-ago period.
Comparable-restaurant sales rose 17.8%.
Restaurant-level operating margins more than doubled.
Net income was $46 million, improved from a net loss of $26 million.
Earnings per share was $1.60, up from a net loss per share of $0.88.
And Chipotle opened 57 new restaurants.

These are ominous numbers for short-sellers. And even more concerning for them is that Chipotle's recovery should continue to gain momentum.
It's continuing to open new restaurants in the United States, and is preparing to expand in Europe. It's rolling out deserts. It's made improvements to its supply chain and food-handling procedures. And it's started marketing much more aggressively than it did in the past.
Moreover, as Jim Cramer has said about the burrito chain, it's only a matter of time before customers forget that it had food safety issues in the first place. He asserts that it takes about 18 months for consumers  to let an issue like this go; that timing corresponds to when Chipotle's stock began its current and most meaningful rally of the past two years.

CMG data by YCharts.
The acceleration of Chipotle's recovery, combined with the high short interest, could play out well for current stockholders. If its share price continues to climb, short-sellers will be pressured to cover their shorts by buying Chipotle stock. This is known as a short squeeze, the consequence of which is a markedly higher share price.
Current and prospective investors in Chipotle have the short-sellers right where they want them. 
",A Lot of Investors Are Still Shorting Chipotle Mexican Grills Stock

What stocks are the ""smartest"" investors buying? We asked three Fool contributors a version of that question: Which stocks are either already getting attention from highly regarded professional investors or should be? Here's why they think Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH), and an old favorite -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- deserve a close look right now. 
An under-the-radar way to invest in self-driving cars
John Rosevear (Delphi Automotive): A lot of analysts and pundits will tell you that Silicon Valley companies are the best way to invest in the coming wave of autonomous vehicles. But some smart investors know that there's plenty of cutting-edge work being done within the ""legacy"" auto industry -- and old-line auto supplier Delphi Automotive increasingly stands out as a company that could profit big as cars and trucks learn to drive themselves. 

Look past the tech-press hype and you'll find Delphi Automotive in the forefront of commercializing self-driving technology. Image source: Delphi Automotive.

Delphi is deeply involved in a number of ventures that aim to bring self-driving technology to market in the next few years. Those include a partnership with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) that will make a ""Level 4"" self-driving system available to any automaker -- old or new -- by the end of 2019. (Learn about the ""levels"" of self-driving technology here.) 
Delphi is also working with those two partners to help BMW AG (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) create a series of self-driving systems -- and Delphi and its partners will have the right to sell those to other automakers as well. Delphi is also believed to be working with several other automakers and tech companies on projects to develop or integrate autonomous technology. 
How big does it expect those businesses to be? Let's put it this way: Delphi recently announced that it will soon spin off its legacy internal combustion engine components business to focus on ""electronic safety systems"" -- specifically, self-driving technology. It's realigning its whole business around this future technology, and it's doing so from a strong position. Delphi's status as a long-established industry supplier means that the automakers will know that its self-driving offerings will perform as advertised. That's not necessarily true of new high-tech entrants. 
Intel's pending purchase of Mobileye means that there's no longer a pure play for those who want to invest in autonomous vehicle technology, at least among public companies. But Delphi is becoming the next best thing. At 20 times earnings, it's not cheap for an old auto industry supplier -- but investors who buy today might look very smart indeed in a few years. 
A smart personalized medicine play
Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Investors who bought shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals early this year are probably feeling really smart right now. The biotech stock is up more than 60% so far in 2017.
The main reason behind Vertex's big surge this year was the company's announcement in March of results from two late-stage clinical studies of a combination of tezacaftor and Kalydeco in treating cystic fibrosis (CF). Those results were so promising that Vertex intends to submit the combo therapy for regulatory approval in the U.S. and in Europe in the third quarter of 2017. 
Vertex also received more good news for Kalydeco. On May 18, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug for use in CF patients ages two and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. This was the fourth FDA approval for the drug, which first gained approval for treating CF patients ages six and older with the specific G551D mutation in the CFTR gene. 
In the meantime, Vertex is continuing to finalize reimbursement deals in European countries for another CF drug, Orkambi. Although Orkambi is the company's newest drug on the market, it has already leaped past Kalydeco to become Vertex's top-selling product.
Based on the strength of Kalydeco and Orkambi, along with good prospects for approval of the tezacaftor/Kalydeco combo, Vertex is one of the top biotechs developing personalized medicines and appears to be poised for tremendous earnings growth. I think buying Vertex is still a smart move even after the stock's big run-up.

Buffett takes another bite of Apple
Keith Noonan (Apple): No investor has cultivated a more esteemed reputation than Warren Buffett, so news that he and his company Berkshire Hathaway have been buying up shares of Apple has understandably attracted a lot of attention. Berkshire now owns roughly 2.5% of outstanding Apple shares, and the company has been increasing its position in the tech giant at a time when there's considerable debate about the iPhone maker's valuation.
Buffett has added to his company's stake in Apple even as shares traded at record highs, making it his company's third-largest holding despite a previously stated aversion to tech investing. The Oracle of Omaha has praised Cupertino's long-term earnings growth potential and also pointed to the company's recent move to increase its share buyback authorization by $35 billion as a favorable sign.

While iPhone sales are showing signs of softening, Apple is seeing strong performance from its services business and has some exciting projects on the horizon including its long-in-development push into smart cars. Also encouraging for Apple investors is momentum in wearables. While the Apple Watch got off to a bit of a rough start, it looks like consumers are becoming more receptive to the company's smartwatch offerings. Sales data from Strategy Analytics for the first quarter of 2017 shows that the company is now the top wearables company by market share, with shipments of its smartwatch increasing 59% year over year to reach 3.5 million units.
With its brand and business strengths, stellar cash flow, and a forward P/E of 17 that still notches below the S&P 500's forward P/E of 18, it's not hard to see why Buffett keeps coming back to Apple.

The retailer's shares rose after it reported first-quarter results that included surprisingly strong profit growth as earnings jumped 20% to $1.22 per share. That trounced the range of $0.80 to $1.00 per share that executives had guided for in late February.
Target's sales trends also edged past expectations, with comparable-store sales declining by 1.3% to mark a tiny improvement over last quarter's 1.5% decrease. Management said they were encouraged by rising demand trends as the quarter progressed. ""After starting the quarter with very soft trends,"" CEO Brian Cornell said in a press release, ""we saw improvement later in the quarter, particularly in March.""

Profitability and customer traffic both shrank during the quarter, which indicates that Target's more aggressive pricing strategy failed to pack the aisles with shoppers. Investors can't expect big profit gains at least over the next few years, either, since the retailer is planning to pour resources into building up its e-commerce infrastructure while shifting its competitive position toward the value end of the market. Yet sales growth trends won't be as bad as initially feared, as Cornell and his team now predict a less brutal comps decline in 2017 than they did three months ago.

Photronics' sinking profit margin
Investors punished Photronics stock after the photomask specialist announced declining sales and profits for its fiscal second quarter and issued conservative sales and profit guidance. Revenue fell 12% due to a 9% drop in integrated circuit photomasks and a 20% slump in those destined for flat panel displays. Net income dove 80% due to a drop in profitability that management blamed on weakening demand for its higher-margin products.

""[I]mproving display photomask sales were offset by a decline in our high-end logic business in Taiwan,"" CEO Peter Kirlin said in a press release.
For the quarter ahead, Kirlin and his team believe they'll benefit from strong overall demand. However, they think a rebound in Photronics' high-end logic business may not happen until the fourth quarter. As a result, their outlook called for revenue between $110 million and $120 million, which lagged consensus estimates targeting $127 million of revenue.
Profits will also be lower than expected. Photronics predicts between $0.05 and $0.12 per share of earnings next quarter while Wall Street was looking for $0.17 per share.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/31/5-takeaways-from-general-electric-companys-lates-2.aspx,2017-05-31,"
It hasn't been a great year for shareholders of General Electric (NYSE:GE), who have watched as the stock hassignificantly underperformed the S&P 500. Now, CEO Jeff Immelt is under pressure to reassure the investment community that the company is back on track toward its earnings and operational goals, and he sought to do just that with his presentation at the Electrical Products Group conference last week. Let's take a closer look at the key takeaways from the presentation.

GE data by YCharts
1. The target of $2 in operating EPS by 2018 will be tough to hit
Frequent readers of the Fool already know that Immelt's target of $2 per share in operating earnings by 2018 is looking like a stretch; his comments at the presentation reflected the work GE would have to do in order to hit that target. In a nutshell, he said that the $2 target was ""at the high end of the range, and our job now is to take more cost out."" Moreover, he added the caveat that the forecast range assumes stable resource markets. 
While Immelt obviously hasn't abandoned his operating EPS goal, it's clear that he knows achieving it will be far from a walk in the park.
2. There are new objectives to focus on
Immelt redirected investors toward a set of objectives against which they can benchmark GE's progress. Both during the main presentation and the question-and-answer session, he reiterated his expectations for 2018:

Organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5%.
Operating margin expansion of 100 basis points.
Free cash flow conversion from net income of 80% to 90%. 

Regarding all three of these objectives, there are considerations to be made. For example, GE missed its initial organic revenue growth expectations in 2016 as its oil-and-gas-related sales growth was a lot weaker than initially expected. Moreover, there are question marks on whether its power business is facing structural problems.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-32896');
            });
        

3. Cost-cutting will be key
Implicit in the expectation for margin expansion is the idea that GE will cut product costs. Immelt outlined ""a couple of big levers"" with which GE can increase margin. Specifically, he discussed GE's H-turbine and the LEAP aircraft engine -- ""[two] of the biggest launches in the history of the company"" -- and how production increases would lead to falling unit costs.
For example, Immelt outlined how an H-turbine's unit cost fell 30% in 2016 and is projected to fall another 10% in 2017, while the unti cost for the LEAP engine (part of a joint venture with France's Snecma) declined 20% in 2016 and is projected to fall another 15% in 2017. 
Cutting costs is clearly a vital objective, as Immelt disclosed that equipment margin had dipped to just 1% in 2016, compared to a historical rate of closer to 5%.
4. So will cash flow generation 
This is a subject of immediate concern for GE; its cash performance in the first quarter was disappointing and indicative of a company facing difficult trading conditions. That said, Immelt reiterated expectations for industrial cash flow of $12 billion to $14 billion in 2017, and going forward, free cash flow conversion from net income is intended to be in the 80% to 90% range.
Discussing the matter, Immelt said: ""I view 2017 as really the last big restructuring year in the company. So this noise is going to kind of come out of the system."" His argument is that the large product launches (such as LEAP and H-turbine mentioned above) and Alstom energy assets integration are using up cash, but cash flow generation would get better going forward.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-57924');
            });
        

5. The troubles of the oil and gas sector are still a concern
One of the criticisms leveled at Immelt is that he was late to the oil and gas party, and then overpaid for a collection of businesses just ahead of a downturn in fossil fuels. Indeed, last year, GE's oil and gas business delivered a disappointing performance.
As Immelt noted, to hit the $2 EPS target, GE needs resource markets to remain stable. ""Again, we've seen, I would say, the oil and gas markets stabilize,"" he said. ""We see orders improving, but it's off a low base. So I still think we have to underwrite caution in that space.""
Where to next for GE?
Overall, Immelt appeared to be backing away from his target of $2 operating EPS by 2018, and instead guiding investors toward another set of objectives that GE could largely achieve through internal execution (unit cost production cuts, increased cash flow), but that remain contingent on end-market conditions -- particularly in the oil and gas sector.
It was a slightly disappointing, but not completely unexpected, presentation. On a positive note, it may well have reset investor expectations. Clearly, though, GE has much work to do in 2017. 
",5 Takeaways From General Electric Company's Latest Presentation
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/26/these-are-the-10-lowest-pe-stocks-today.aspx,2017-05-26,"
Value investors like stocks whose share prices are relatively inexpensive compared to their earnings potential. By focusing on stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios, many value investors uncover stocks that have been unfairly punished by the market at large. However, in many cases, stocks that have low P/E ratios have a good reason for trading where they do, making some of them serious value traps. Below, you'll find the 10 stocks in the S&P 500 that have the lowest trailing earnings multiples, along with some discussion about whether they're actually good bargains for value investors going forward.
The 10 lowest P/Es today
Here are the 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with the lowest trailing P/E ratios as of May 25:

eBay

General Motors (NYSE:GM)


5.1




Transocean 


6.4




Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD)

Goodyear Tire & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT)

7.5

7.6




Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG)


8




Corning

Michael Kors


8.3




Data source: Finviz, Yahoo! Finance.
We can dispense with some of these stocks very quickly, based on known facts that make their trailing earnings multiples misleading. In the case of eBay, Transocean, and Corning, current earnings have been inflated to some extent, and investors fully expect that future earnings will be lower. Both eBay and Corning have forward earnings multiples in the teens, and most investors actually expect Transocean to post a loss in the near future, rendering its P/E ratio meaningless.
Highly sensitive company-specific news is also a cause for some of these stocks to trade at these levels. Signet, for instance, has had to deal with controversy related to allegations of sexual harassment and wage disparities within the company, and its most recent results included an 11.5% plunge in same-store sales from year-ago levels. That's enough to make some investors hesitate going forward.
Cyclical concerns
One group of stocks on this list has low P/E ratios in large part because investors see their respective industries near the high point of the business cycle. General Motors has enjoyed the benefits of record auto sales in the industry in 2015 and 2016, but few think that its upward trajectory can continue. Similarly, Gilead Sciences has seen huge long-term growth from its stable of treatments for diseases like HIV, but many are concerned that the loss of patent protection on key products will result in an inevitable sales decline that will affect the bottom line as well.
The key for such stocks is to recognize that when the low end of the cycle hits, their P/E ratios will look extremely high. It's important to get familiar with the range of earnings ratios throughout the cycle. That way, when you see extremely low values like this, you won't overreact, because you'll know that when industry conditions return to more normal levels, P/Es will be more reasonable.

            });
        

Challenging situations
Another group of stocks on the list reflect the challenges that companies face in particular industries. Bed Bath & Beyond and Michael Kors are dealing with tough conditions in retail, and they've had difficulty fending off competition from e-commerce specialists while also struggling to retain their leadership roles in their respective niches. If they can retrench and find ways to grow, then their share prices should recover, but they first have to find answers to the competitive threats they face.
Similar issues apply to other companies. Navient provides servicing and collection help on student loans, and the combination of a rising rate environment and greater attention on the student-loan problem could put pressure on Navient going forward.

The most interesting stock on the list
In that light, Goodyear Tire & Rubber is arguably the most interesting company among these 10 low P/E stocks. Goodyear has ambitious goals for the near future, including plans to boost operating margin, free cash flow, and dividends over the next several years. Although many investors note that most of the company's revenue comes from tire replacement -- something that doesn't necessarily offer much room for long-term growth -- Goodyear has done a good job of gaining first-mover status in China. For nearly a quarter-century, Goodyear has worked to grow in the world's second-largest economy, and decisions to expand its factory presence in China should pay off with a greater portion of global sales coming from the most populous nation in the world by the end of the decade. If you believe in that growth story, then current P/E levels look extremely low for Goodyear.
Just because a stock has a low earnings multiple doesn't make it a bargain. By understanding the reasons why a stock has a low P/E, you can better assess whether the company really deserves a place in your investment portfolio.

",These Are the 10 Lowest P/E Stocks Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/25/why-international-game-technology-genesco-and-ensc.aspx,2017-05-25,"
Thursday was another strong day on Wall Street, with major benchmarks posting gains across the board. The S&P 500 reached another all-time high on strength from an upbeat view of the economy and good earnings results from major companies in the retail sector. Although energy prices sagged, investors seemed to focus on the cost savings that consumers would enjoy from cheaper gasoline rather than the profit hit that major oil and natural gas companies might suffer. Still, not every stock participated in the rally, and International Game Technology (NYSE:IGT), Genesco (NYSE:GCO), and Ensco (NYSE:ESV) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
IGT loses the game
Shares of International Game Technology fell 13% after the company reported first-quarter financial results that didn't live up to investor expectations. The lottery-game technology specialist saw its sales drop 10% from year-ago levels, and even after accounting for certain extraordinary items, adjusted earnings were well below the consensus forecast among those following the stock. International Game Technology believes that some of its woes were due to the luck of the draw, with fewer major jackpots occurring during the period. Yet some investors are more nervous about IGT's long-term future, especially given that lottery game innovation has seemed to slow in recent years. Without a dramatic boost to the industry, International Game Technology could have trouble making further progress in the months and years ahead.

Genesco makes a misstep
Genesco stock plunged 23% in the wake of the company's downbeat first-quarter results. The maker of footwear and apparel said that revenue fell slightly on a roughly 1% drop in comparable sales, with brick-and-mortar comparable-store sales falling a more precipitous 4%. Genesco blamed the poor performance in part on delayed tax refunds, but even CEO Robert Dennis acknowledged that weak store traffic was also due to difficulties in matching up the company's retail offerings with consumer tastes. A more-than-10% cut to earnings guidance for the full year also contributed to a downbeat attitude among shareholders, and even value investors who see the potential for big gains if Genesco can turn things around seem to want to see more clarity going forward before committing their capital.

            });
        

Ensco looks for more energy
Finally, shares of Ensco declined nearly 10%. The offshore drilling specialist's drop was roughly in line with what many of its peers in the energy industry suffered today, as the volatile crude oil market again traded down, falling back below the $50-per-barrel level. That's bad news for energy companies generally, but it's especially difficult for Ensco and its offshore peers, because higher energy prices are necessary for many oil and gas exploration and production companies to be able to afford the more extensive capital investments necessary to develop offshore projects profitably. The extent of crude oil's plunge has sent Ensco stock to its lowest levels in decades, and it will take huge efforts from the company to find ways to remain viable if oil prices remain low for the foreseeable future.

The stock market celebrated Thursday by sending the S&P 500 to a record high. Gains for the major benchmarks varied from a third of a percent to three-quarters of a percent, as investors were generally pleased with signs that the consumer economy in the U.S. continues to move ahead strongly. Solid earnings reports from major retail giants helped to set a positive tone, and even the drop in crude oil prices back down below $50 per barrel wasn't enough to keep the overall market from gaining ground. In addition, good news from other individual companies helped support investor sentiment, and Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD), Aerie Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AERI), and Guess? (NYSE:GES) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Sears satisfies investors with its earnings report
Shares of Sears Holdings climbed 13.5% after the retailer reported its first-quarter financial results. Revenue fell by a fifth to $4.3 billion, and comparable-store sales were down almost 12%, adding to the downward pressure from closures of Sears and Kmart stores. However, the loss of $244 million was only about half what Sears lost in the first quarter of 2016. CEO Eddie Lampert was upbeat about the performance, noting that ""while this was certainly a challenging quarter for our company ... we recognize that we need to accelerate our efforts to improve our operational performance and are moving decisively with our $1.25 billion restructuring program."" Whether the cost savings that result from restructuring efforts prove to be enough to save Sears remains to be seen, but the venerable retailer isn't going to give up without a fight.

Aerie sees its future more clearly
Aerie Pharmaceuticals stock soared by more than a third in the wake of encouraging results from the phase 3 trial of the company's Roclatan treatment for glaucoma. The trial found that Roclatan achieved its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistically superior performance in lowering intraocular pressure compared to the two individual components of the combination therapy. Aerie CEO Vicente Anido Jr. praised the news, arguing that ""with this positive Mercury 2 [study] data, we now have two successful pivotal trials for Roclatan."" With low discontinuation rates for the study, Aerie will have an easier road ahead of it. Relatively few side effects occurred, and investors appear encouraged that the prospects for Aerie's drug are extremely strong going forward.

            });
        

Guess? looks to turn things around
Finally, shares of Guess? gained 14%. The denim specialist reported its fiscal first-quarter results Wednesday night, which included sales growth of 2%. Even though the key Americas retail business continued to struggle through sales declines and profit pressures, better performance overseas helped to offset some of the headwinds that Guess? faced. In addition, the jeans maker boosted its guidance for the full 2018 fiscal year, now expecting sales to climb at a 3.5% to 5% clip. Tough times in the retail sector don't appear to be over just yet, and Guess? is still seeing some pressure with respect to its ability to drive its business forward, especially in the U.S. market. After such a long time of seeing unequivocally bad news, however, even a few signs of hope for Guess? are enough to get some investors excited about the stock once again.

To be clear, I don't suggest that anyone should buy just one stock. In order to properly invest in the stock market, you need a diverse portfolio, which means investing in five or six different stocks at a minimum.
Having said that, there are still some good investments to make if you only have enough capital to buy one stock. In the past, I've made the case that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) is one of the closest things to a stand-alone stock that you can find. Today, I'd like to take another page out of Warren Buffett's playbook and talk about the best investment the Oracle of Omaha feels most people can make.

Image source: Getty Images.

The best investment most people can make
Warren Buffett is one of the greatest stock-pickers of all time, so it may come as a surprise that he's said, many times, that the best investment most people can make is a simple, low-cost S&P 500 index fund.
Buffett considers an investment in the S&P to be an overall bet on American business -- one that has paid off extremely well in the past, and should continue to do so over long time periods. Over the long run, the S&P 500 has averaged total returns of about 10% per year, and while there is no way to guarantee future performance, there's no reason to expect any different over the next 20, 50, or 100 years.
To prove his point, about nine years ago, Warren Buffett offered to wager $500,000 that no group of at least five hedge funds would match the performance of an unmanaged S&P 500 index fund (Buffett chose a Vanguard S&P index fund) over a 10-year period. With one year to go, the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of 85%, handily outperforming the 22% return averaged by a professionally selected group of five ""funds of funds.""
The point Buffett was trying to make is that as a whole, active investing and its high fees would underperform the results of simple buy-and-hold investing over long periods of time. After nine years of solid outperformance, it's tough to argue against him.
My favorite S&P 500 index fund
I mentioned that Warren Buffett used a Vanguard S&P 500 index fund in his bet, and that's actually my personal favorite -- particularly the ETF variety.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO) trades just like a stock, making it extremely easy to invest in. The fund charges a rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.05% -- meaning that if you have $10,000 invested, you'll pay just $5 in fees this year.
In a nutshell, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is an all-in-one bet on the long-term success of American business. With one of the lowest fee structures of any mutual fund or ETF in the market, most of the long-term gains of the index will help you build wealth -- and won't go toward making fund managers rich.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-59491');
            });
        

If I could only buy one stock
In full disclosure, I don't own any shares of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, or any other S&P 500 index fund, for that matter. This is because I've accumulated a well-diversified stock portfolio over the years, and feel I have a reasonably good chance to beat the market over long periods of time with my stocks.
What I'm saying here is that if I were just getting started with investing, or if I didn't have the time, knowledge, or desire to invest in individual stocks the right way, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is a great investment, all by itself.

This showdown is definitely a product of the paradigm shift to e-commerce. While most folks would think that ship has sailed, consider that online sales accounted for on just 8% of retail sales in the U.S. for 2016. Excluding cars and fuel from the equation pushed that figure higher to 15.6% of retail sales. Even at that rate, e-commerce still has a long runway ahead. 
Let's look at our contestants. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) provides merchants with a one-stop shop that simplifies the setup and administration of an online store, including a customizable multi-channel e-commerce and payments platform. The company's easy-to-use cloud-based service provides 100 templates and over 1,000 apps to customize the experience.
PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has grown from its roots as the best-known digital-payment method into a full-service payment processor and mobile wallet. The company has partnered will all the major credit card issuers, and its members can choose a funding source for each transaction, either online or in stores.
Both companies provide a vital service in the area of e-commerce, but which company is a better buy now?

In the race for e-commerce, which company has a superior outlook? Image source: Getty Images.

Financial fortitude
It is great to see that both companies have no debt, which gives them a measure of financial flexibility. Shopify's negative net income and free cash flow might be a cause for a greater degree of concern if it hadn't resulted from management's heavy reinvestment to grow the business. Still, Shopify has very little in reserves in the event of unforeseen circumstances or a financial downturn. That could lead to taking on debt or issuing additional stock, which would be dilutive to existing shareholders.

PayPal, on the other hand has a significant amount of cash and is regularly producing more. This advantage puts the company on a much firmer financial footing.
Winner: PayPal.
Recent results and growth prospects
In its most recent quarter, Shopify grew its revenue to $127.4 million, up 75% year over year. At the same time, its monthly recurring revenue increased $20.7 million, up 62% over the prior-year quarter. Gross merchandise volume hit $4.8 billion, up 81% year over year, and gross payments volume increased to $1.8 billion, representing 37% growth over the prior-year quarter. Shopify also exceeded 400,000 merchants for the first time, up 45% from last year.  
During its quarterly financial release, PayPal reported revenue of $2.98 billion, up 17% year over year. Its active customers increased to 203 million, up 11% over the prior-year quarter, while payment transactions increased to 1.7 billion, up 23%. Existing customers are also using the service more, with payments per customer increasing 12% year over year. 
With e-commerce still in its early stages, both companies stand to gain from the evolving demographics, and both have been growing nicely. Shopify has the upper hand, having grown gross merchandise volume by over 100% year over year in six of the seven quarters since going public and sported revenue growth in excess of 86% year over year in every quarter since its debut. 
Winner: Shopify.

Stock performance and valuation
Over the past year, both companies have outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin. PayPal stock is up 34%, more than double that of the index. And Shopify trounced both, with an astonishing return of over 200%.

Data by YCharts
To determine valuation, a number of metrics would normally be used, However, none of the usual metrics are applicable for valuing Shopify. The company is not yet profitable, as it has chosen to plow all it earns and more back into growth, so using a P/E ratio is useless, as is the PEG ratio. It's free cash flow-negative. Measuring price to sales, however, Shopify has a multiple of 18, compared with PayPal's less expensive 5 times trailing sales. Looking forward, Shopify sports a still-high multiple of 13, compared with PayPal's 5 times forward sales.

PS Ratio data by YCharts
So while Shopify stock has posted better returns, PayPal's stock is less expensive.
Winner: Tie.
Final tally
The final tally reveals a tie. Which company to invest in will most likely depend on an investor's disposition. I believe that both companies have the potential to produce market-beating returns over the next several year, which is why I own both. But someone looking for a more risky investment, with a chance of a greater reward, might be more inclined toward Shopify, while an investor looking for less risk and a more secure financial footing will probably be inclined toward PayPal.

There are only two publicly traded gunmakers in America: American Outdoor Brands (NASDAQ:AOBC) (formerly known as Smith & Wesson) and Sturm, Ruger & Company (NYSE:RGR). Today, we're examining each company's revenue over the past four years, as well as estimates for 2017.
Gun sales don't consistently rise. Instead, they're influenced by current events and politics. NICS background checks for firearm purchases -- the key gauge of gun demand -- generally rise after mass shootings and Democratic proposals of tougher gun regulations, and fall when Republicans are in power.

Data source: Financial Times. Chart created by author.

American Outdoor has been diversifying into adjacent markets like laser sights, accessories, and knives to reduce its dependence on firearms. That's why its sales are expected to rise this year, while Sturm, Ruger's revenue -- which depends entirely on guns -- is expected to decline. However, American Outdoor remains more exposed to potential assault weapon bans than Sturm, Ruger, which sells more pistols, single-shot rifles, and shotguns.
NICS background checks have declined annually for five straight months now, so investors should brace for tough year-over-year comparisons over the next few quarters. But neither gunmaker is likely to fade away. Instead, they'll probably continue diversifying their core businesses away from firearms and controversial assault weapons.

",A Foolish Take: What's Next for America's Top Gunmakers?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/30/3-dividend-stocks-for-long-term-investors.aspx,2017-05-30,"
Investors can chase the latest trends and find success with investing, but if you're looking for reliable businesses capable of paying shareholders over a long period of time, then often it's best to look at reliable businesses that have paid shareholders over a long period of time. 
That's why three of our contributors think Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), and PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) are good places to start for investors looking for a steady stream of income.

Literally brick and mortar
Dylan Lewis (Lowe's): With all the discussion around the death of retail, it may be surprising to see a brick-and-mortar company that literally sells bricks and mortar on this list.
The reality is many consider the home improvement chain to be ""e-commerce-proof,"" as customers tend to come to the store looking for bulky specialty items, and often need assistance from in-store experts that have years of experience in DIY work.  
That, plus the company's status as a dividend aristocrat, should ease any worries investors have about buying a retail giant. 
Lowe's offers investors a reliable base business, with some interesting growth opportunities. Management is guiding to add 10-20 stores per year to the company's existing 2,400 store footprint and expects low single-digit same store sales growth. With that modest growth profile, the company trades more or less in line with the market, at 25 times trailing earnings.
But right now roughly 90% of the company's revenue comes from the United States. If management's plans to double business in Mexico bear fruit, it could provide the business (and investors) a nice little bump. 
Even so, the company's top line keeps marching along, fueling the stock's 1.7% yield. Right now, Lowe's is only paying out about 40% of earnings with its dividend payments, proving there's plenty of room for the company to continue the aggressive annual increases investors have enjoyed over the past few years. 
A go-to for growth
Keith Noonan (PepsiCo): Food and beverage giant PepsiCo has built a reputation for being a go-to choice for income-focused investors, and it's not hard to see why. The stock has reliably outperformed the market when dividend disbursements are accounted for, packs a terrific track record of payout growth, and, most importantly, it's backed by a great business that has the potential to continue enriching shareholders for many years to come.
Few companies can lay claim to a better history of returning income to shareholders than Pepsi, and continued dividend growth looks to be a safe bet. The company has increased its payout for 44 years running and is set to deliver its 45th annual dividend increase this June; that's a stretch that includes six U.S. recessions and points to the likelihood of reliable payout growth even when the broader economy hits a rough patch.
The company's 2.8% yield already sits comfortably above the S&P 500's yield of roughly 1.9%, and, with the annualized cost of distributing its current dividend representing roughly 67% of trailing free cash flow and the company's significant long-term earnings growth potential, there's still room for payout increases. 
With a forward P/E of 22, PepsiCo looks like a reasonably priced investment that's poised to live up its reputation as a great dividend stock to hold for the long term.

M-m-mmm good dividends
Rich Duprey (Campbell Soup): Soup maker Campbell Soup is colder than a bowl of gazpacho these days, but its annual dividend of $1.40 per share that currently yields 2.4% still gives investors with a hearty appetite to dine on its stock.
The prepared foods company has come under pressure from changing consumer tastes. Like so many other industries reacting to how consumers shop, Campbell's has felt the pinch as shoppers gravitate toward fresher, healthier foods and avoid the center aisles of the grocery store.
To meet the challenge, Campbell created a fresh foods division two years ago, but it was hit last year by quality issues in its carrot business and had a recall at its Bolthouse beverages unit. It is now cycling through those problems and next year it is looking forward to greater growth, particularly as it offers up some innovations, like premium juices, different colored carrots, and bagged carrots with seasonings, which it is now selling into school systems instead of at grocery stores.
The company is also on track to exceed its $300 million cost-cutting plan a year early. While it noted it had a slow start to the year, business picked back up in March and April, and it ended up growing or maintaining market share in 11 different categories, which represents three quarters of its U.S. retail dollar sales.
Campbell Soup stock is down 15% from recent highs and  trades at 18 times next year's earnings estimates. Investors can view its shares as a bit of comfort food and collect the dividend as they wait for the soup maker to get back on track to steaming growth.

",3 Dividend Stocks for Long-Term Investors
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/17/why-american-eagle-outfitters-corecivic-and-advanc.aspx,2017-05-17,"
Stocks had their worst day of the year so far on Wednesday, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all declining sharply from their recent advances. The Nasdaq Composite had risen the furthest and therefore had the most ground to lose, closing the day with a 2.5% loss, but the Dow and S&P 500 weren't far behind with drops of almost 2%. Fears about growing controversy concerning President Trump and investigations of members of his administration finally led to significant selling pressure from traders, and market participants are now betting that many of the initiatives that the new president had proposed might not happen.
In addition, some company-specific news pushed stocks lower, and American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO), CoreCivic (NYSE:CXW), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
American Eagle doesn't see improvement coming soon
Shares of American Eagle Outfitters dropped 15% in the wake of the company's first-quarter financial report. The teen retailer managed to boost comparable sales by 2%, but adjusted operating income was down by more than a quarter from the year-ago period. More disconcerting was the fact that American Eagle now projects that its second-quarter results won't be as strong as investors had hoped, and restructuring plans will likely accelerate and include the closing of 25 to 40 store locations during the full year. In the long run, the retailer is hopeful that its actions will help to return American Eagle to a growth trajectory. But after today's report, it looks like any rebound won't come nearly as quickly as many had hoped.

CoreCivic falls on government policy fears
CoreCivic stock dropped 10% after the political fallout hit the private prison services company hard. The stock had seen gains of more than 70% after the November election, with many seeing the potential for expanded use of privately run detention facilities under the Trump administration. However, the company formerly known as Corrections Corp. of America could face more difficulties if Washington gridlock worsens during the current controversy. If things blow over for the White House, then the drop in shares of CoreCivic and peers in the private prison industry could well look like an overreaction in the long run. Yet if the crisis doesn't end favorably, then CoreCivic could have more room to drop, as its stock is still up by half since November.

AMD's guidance disappoints
Finally, shares of Advanced Micro Devices gave up 12%. The chipmaker said in its much-anticipated investor day presentation that it would focus more on high-end products, looking to discard its reputation as a secondary player to industry giants with greater market share in their respective product niches. The Ryzen line of core processing units is already out, and AMD will release more chips later this year, including the Vega graphics processing unit and the EPYC server processor. Yet shareholders seemed unimpressed by guidance for revenue growth that barely broke into double-digit percentages, and even though longer-term calls for gains in margin are encouraging, they apparently didn't justify the gains the shares had already seen recently.

When it comes to investing your money, two of the most common choices are stocks, which are also known as equities, and bonds, which are also known as fixed-income investments. One of the most common questions I hear from new investors is along the lines of ""I don't want to take too much risk, but I also want to grow my money. Which is the better investment for me -- stocks or bonds?""
Here's a discussion of the pros and cons of each type of investment, and what the ideal choice is for the average new investor.

Pros and cons of stocks
You may have heard that stocks outperform every other major asset class over long periods, and that's true. Stocks are a smart choice for investors who want to maximize their long-term growth potential, as overall, stocks have produced annualized total returns of nearly 10% historically.
However, the downside is volatility. Stocks can be rather volatile investments and are therefore only appropriate for investment capital that you're not going to need anytime soon -- say for at least five years. To illustrate why this is important, consider that over the past 10 years, the S&P 500, perhaps the most representative index of the overall performance of stocks, has increased by 59%.

^SPX data by YCharts
Here's the most important point. Notice that the path to that 59% gain wasn't straight up. In fact, by March 2009, the market had fallen by 55% from where it was on May 26, 2007, 10 years ago from this writing. Imagine if you had invested money in stocks in 2007 that you needed to pay your kids' college tuition with in 2009.
Also keep in mind that when I say ""stocks,"" I'm referring to a well-diversified portfolio of 10 to 20 solid companies, or to stock-based mutual funds, not to individual equities.
Pros and cons of bonds
On the other hand, bonds, also known as fixed-income investments, are designed to produce steady income and protect your principal.
For example, a bond that costs $1,000 and has a 5% ""coupon rate"" would pay out $50 per year until maturity. At that point, your original $1,000 investment would be returned.
So the main reasons to invest in bonds include steady, predictable income, as well as capital preservation. The downside is that the long-term growth potential is significantly less than that of stocks. Over long periods of time, stocks have historically returned 9%-10% annually, depending on whom you ask, while bond returns are in the 4%-5% ballpark over the long run.
It's also important to mention that while bonds generally have less volatility and risk than stocks, they are by no means risk-free and can go down in value. Here's a primer on some of the risk factors all investors should know about bond investing.

            });
        

The best bet: a combination of both
The answer to the question of which is better is both. However, the right amount of each depends of certain factors, particularly age.
Here's a quick but thorough guide to asset allocation. A general rule of thumb is that if you subtract your age from the number 110, you'll find the percentage of your investments that should be in stocks, with the remainder in bonds. For example, I'm 35, so that implies that 75% of my portfolio should be in stocks and the other 25% in bonds.
This isn't a one-size-fits-all rule, and your ideal asset allocation might be slightly higher or lower. The point I want to make is that nearly 100% of your investment portfolio should be invested in a combination of stocks and bonds, as opposed to being kept in cash-equivalent investments such as CDs or money market funds. And according to the rule, unless you're over 110 years old, you should always have some of your investment dollars in stocks.
Don't get me wrong -- it's a great idea to keep some cash on the sidelines in an emergency fund, or to convert a small percentage of your investments to cash if you're already retired and capital preservation is your top priority. I'm just saying that stocks and bonds should be the primary focus of your investment portfolio, regardless of your age.
The Foolish bottom line
The point is that a properly allocated investment strategy is the best way to go, and that either stocks or bonds is a better idea than simply sticking your money in a savings account. The average American doesn't own any either outside a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement account, so it's fair to say that the average American would benefit from adding some stocks and bonds to his or her investment strategy.

As we head toward the Memorial Day holiday, many of the companies listed on the stock market will take a breather, too... at least as far as dividend raises are concerned. With the approach of summer, we're moving away from the latest earnings season, and there were relatively few payout hikes last week.
That doesn't mean the scene was idle, though. A clutch of companies declared higher distributions, including the following three notables.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Southwest Airlines
One of the more popular air carrier stocks on the market, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), is propelling its quarterly dividend 25% higher, to almost $0.13 per share. Additionally, the company's board authorized a new, $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, which replaces an expired initiative at the same amount.
At first, these moves might seem counterintuitive. On the face of it, Southwest's first quarter wasn't anything to jump in the air about, with revenue edging up only 1%, against costs that rose by nearly 9%. On the bottom line, adjusted net profit dove by 35%. Neither adjusted earnings ($372 million, or $0.61 per share) nor revenue (nearly $4.9 billion) hit the average analyst estimate.
Yet there was plenty to be cheered about in those results, not least of which was the company's high net margin -- no easy feat in an industry with persistently high costs. Another positive was that Southwest notched a new all-time high for first-quarter operating profit, at over $1.6 billion. That's almost triple what the company shelled out for dividends and share buybacks during the period. This bodes very well for the future of its payout.

LUV Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts.
Southwest's new dividend is to be dispensed on June 28 to stockholders of record as of June 7. At the most recent closing share price, it would yield 0.8%. That's well under the current 1.9% average yield of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500.
The carrier did not give an end date for its new share buyback program.
Northrop Grumman
Veteran aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), as per its once-a-year habit, has raised its quarterly dividend -- by 11% to $0.90 per share. The company didn't hesitate to mention that this represents the 14th straight year it has improved its payout.

NOC Dividend data by YCharts.
In contrast to fellow airborne stock Southwest Airlines, Northrop Grumman blew the market away with its first-quarter results. There was very little not to like: Sales were a sturdy 5% higher on a year-over-year basis, while net profit grew a very encouraging 15%. Both line items ($6.3 billion and $640 million, respectively) thrashed analyst estimates.
The world needs the kind of products made by Northrop Grumman and its peers; witness the recent series of arms deals signed by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states with the U.S. that will amount to roughly $350 billion. The immediate future looks quite good for the defense industry.
One slightly worrying development for Northrop Grumman in that otherwise stellar first quarter is operating cash flow -- high consumption plunged that line item into the red, to the tune of $439 million. The company should right that aircraft, though; it's sticking with its projections of a $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion surplus for this fiscal year. This should be sufficient to cover the company's dividend, and a shareholder-pleasing level of share buybacks.
Northrop Grumman will pay its next dividend on June 21 to investors of record as of June 5. It yields a theoretical 1.4% on the current share price.

            });
        

KeyCorp
KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), one of the numerous regional banking groups doing its thing in smaller markets, is bumping its quarterly dividend $0.01 (or 12%) higher to just under $0.10 per share.
KeyCorp is a bulkier entity than it used to be thanks to the company's acquisition of fellow regional First Niagara, in a $4 billion deal that was consummated last July. This helped KeyCorp increase its total revenue by 44%, net interest income by 52%, and per-share adjusted net income by 33%. The latter, by the way, topped analyst estimates -- the third quarter in a row the bank has achieved this feat.
KeyCorp has done a fine job expanding from its core Rust Belt operations. The First Niagara deal in particular gives it a presence in complementary Northeast markets, particularly upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. Due to synergies, it should also save money -- KeyCorp is on pace to cut annual expenses by around $450 million, up from an initial estimate of $400 million.
Which, of course, potentially means a significant bulge in the company's coffers. Last year, the bank managed to grow its free cash flow by almost 70% to $1.4 billion, and with the bulked-up operations and lower expenses, there's probably more where that came from. Last year's pile easily covered both dividend payouts and share buybacks, and I can't imagine that dynamic will change anytime soon.

KEY Free Cash Flow (Annual) data by YCharts.
KeyCorp's upcoming distribution is to be paid on June 15 to shareholders of record as of May 30. At the company's most recent closing stock price, it would yield 2.1%.

Every investor has a story to tell about a stock that changed his or her life. We Fools are no different, so we asked a team to share a story about a stock that they own that's particularly meaningful to them. Read on to hear how Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Silver Standard Resources (NASDAQ:SSRI) changed their financial lives for the better.

Quality is worth the price of admission
Brian Feroldi (Amazon.com): I've owned more than 150 individual stocks since I started investing, and they each have taught me a valuable lesson or two. My early foray into penny-stock land was particularly illuminating, as I learned very quickly that you can lose a lot of money in a flash even if the stock is trading for under $1 per share. However, the company that has changed my investing philosophy the most, by far, is Amazon.com.
While I'd been a happy Amazon consumer for years, I was extremely reluctant to become a shareholder. My reasoning wasn't based on the company's leadership team, its balance sheet, the market opportunity, or the business fundamentals. I knew enough about investing to realize that the company was on solid footing in all of these areas. Instead, the only thing that kept me away was the company's valuation. One look at Amazon's P/E ratio was more than enough to keep me from buying shares.
Obviously, that decision turned out to be a huge blunder. Instead of buying shares for under $100 in 2007, 2008, or 2009 as I should have, I sat on the sidelines and watched the stock go up.
I finally decided that enough was enough and become a shareholder in February 2010, after David Gardner called out Amazon as a ""best buy now"" in Stock Advisor. My initial purchase price was $114, which was an all-time high for Amazon at the time. Regardless, I decided I wanted to become an owner and steadily added to my position over the next few years at higher and higher prices. 
That proved to be one of the best financial decisions I ever made. Amazon continued to perform beautifully and is currently flirting with a $1,000 price tag. That enormous share-price appreciation has turned the company into my single biggest holding.
My experience with Amazon has taught me a number of important lessons. First, if you like everything about a business but the valuation, buy a small position anyway. Truly great businesses can grow into their valuations and surprise to the upside. Second, winning stocks tend to keep on winning, so it can still make sense to buy even if the stock is at an all-time high. Finally, long-term investing works. If you've managed to catch lightning in a bottle, don't be in a hurry to book a quick gain.
A game changer
Keith Noonan (Activision Blizzard): I spent plenty of time playing Activision Blizzard video games and keeping up with broader industry happenings before I initiated a position in the company, and I can happily say that those hours manning the joysticks and reading gaming websites have resulted in a material payoff.
Adhering to the school of thought that investing in industries you're familiar with can give you a decisive edge, I identified Activision Blizzard as a company with an impressive portfolio of products and purchased shares in 2014 at an average price of $22.50. Following three years of strong business performance, the stock now trades above $58 -- good for a 158% return across a period when the S&P 500 index has gained roughly 22%. Who said playing video games will never get you anywhere?
Today, Activision Blizzard looks stronger than ever, with an expanding stable of popular franchises and rapid growth in digitally distributed content driving sales and margins to record levels. Following the success of last year's Overwatch, Activision Blizzard now counts eight billion-dollar franchises under its corporate wing, and the game's success also played a role in the 50% year-over-year increase in the company's digital sales in its most recent quarter.
With digital content sales likely to provide an ongoing source of momentum, an impressive track record of creating and maintaining great franchises, and the company's emerging opportunities in virtual reality, e-sports, and consumer products, I'm betting that Activision Blizzard has what it takes to be a long-term winner.

This stock brought some luster to this Fool's portfolio
Sean Williams (Silver Standard Resources): Picking out the stock that changed my life is simple: Silver Standard Resources, which came by way of its purchase of Claude Resources in 2016. It was through Claude Resources, and now Silver Standard Resources, that I learned how lucrative buy-and-hold investing could be.
I began nibbling on shares of Claude Resources more than five years ago, with the belief that a couple of simple turnarounds would fix its issues. Claude has been holding an asset that wasn't economically feasible to develop, given its debt situation and falling spot gold prices. It was also seeing higher-than-necessary mining costs at its flagship Seabee mine and was a couple of years away from a major expansion of the Santoy Gap. If I had put myself into the CEO's shoes, I would have restructured the debt, sold off non-core assets, and worked to lower mining costs. Lo and behold, that's exactly what happened.
In late 2013, Claude announced that it had sold the Madsen Project -- the aforementioned asset that it couldn't feasibly develop -- for cash and stock considerations to Laurentian Goldfields, and it wound up restructuring its debt not too long after. More importantly, it found ways to reduce its all-in sustaining costs at Seabee and bring the Santoy Gap online ahead of schedule. Before I knew it, Claude was generating more than 70,000 ounces of annual gold production when it had historically been stuck around 50,000 ounces of annual gold production. Best of all, it was generating positive cash flow and a profit.
In March 2016, Silver Standard Resources offered to acquire Claude Resources in what was essentially an all-stock deal -- the cash component was laughably small. Since the value of the two companies was intricately linked, the 32% premium to Claude's closing price on the day the deal was announced turned into a nearly 100% premium by the time the deal closed three months later. Since then, Santoy Gap production has increased, and I've seen my investment grow more than sevenfold.
Since my initial nibble, and through today, I've yet to sell a single share -- and I see no reason to start now. Silver Standard generates a little over 80% of its sales from gold production and is soon changing its name to SSR Mining to reflect this shift in production -- at a time when physical silver and gold  look poised to increase in value. Uncertainty surrounding Brexit and Trump's presidency, rising inflation levels, and constrained gold and silver supply are all reasons to believe Silver Standard's margins can improve as spot metals rise and the company aims to keep spending under control. Plus, a new joint venture in Argentina should help reignite its silver production beginning in the second half of 2018.
If there's a stock that's changed this Fool's life, it's Silver Standard Resources. n

Read on to hear how Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Silver Standard Resources (NASDAQ:SSRI) changed their financial lives for the better.

Quality is worth the price of admission
Brian Feroldi (Amazon.com): I've owned more than 150 individual stocks since I started investing, and they each have taught me a valuable lesson or two. My early foray into penny-stock land was particularly illuminating, as I learned very quickly that you can lose a lot of money in a flash even if the stock is trading for under $1 per share. However, the company that has changed my investing philosophy the most, by far, is Amazon.com.
While I'd been a happy Amazon consumer for years, I was extremely reluctant to become a shareholder. My reasoning wasn't based on the company's leadership team, its balance sheet, the market opportunity, or the business fundamentals. I knew enough about investing to realize that the company was on solid footing in all of these areas. Instead, the only thing that kept me away was the company's valuation. One look at Amazon's P/E ratio was more than enough to keep me from buying shares.
Obviously, that decision turned out to be a huge blunder. Instead of buying shares for under $100 in 2007, 2008, or 2009 as I should have, I sat on the sidelines and watched the stock go up.
I finally decided that enough was enough and become a shareholder in February 2010, after David Gardner called out Amazon as a ""best buy now"" in Stock Advisor. My initial purchase price was $114, which was an all-time high for Amazon at the time. Regardless, I decided I wanted to become an owner and steadily added to my position over the next few years at higher and higher prices. 
That proved to be one of the best financial decisions I ever made. Amazon continued to perform beautifully and is currently flirting with a $1,000 price tag. That enormous share-price appreciation has turned the company into my single biggest holding.
My experience with Amazon has taught me a number of important lessons. First, if you like everything about a business but the valuation, buy a small position anyway. Truly great businesses can grow into their valuations and surprise to the upside. Second, winning stocks tend to keep on winning, so it can still make sense to buy even if the stock is at an all-time high. Finally, long-term investing works. If you've managed to catch lightning in a bottle, don't be in a hurry to book a quick gain.
A game changer
Keith Noonan (Activision Blizzard): I spent plenty of time playing Activision Blizzard video games and keeping up with broader industry happenings before I initiated a position in the company, and I can happily say that those hours manning the joysticks and reading gaming websites have resulted in a material payoff.
Adhering to the school of thought that investing in industries you're familiar with can give you a decisive edge, I identified Activision Blizzard as a company with an impressive portfolio of products and purchased shares in 2014 at an average price of $22.50. Following three years of strong business performance, the stock now trades above $58 -- good for a 158% return across a period when the S&P 500 index has gained roughly 22%. Who said playing video games will never get you anywhere?
Today, Activision Blizzard looks stronger than ever, with an expanding stable of popular franchises and rapid growth in digitally distributed content driving sales and margins to record levels. Following the success of last year's Overwatch, Activision Blizzard now counts eight billion-dollar franchises under its corporate wing, and the game's success also played a role in the 50% year-over-year increase in the company's digital sales in its most recent quarter.
With digital content sales likely to provide an ongoing source of momentum, an impressive track record of creating and maintaining great franchises, and the company's emerging opportunities in virtual reality, e-sports, and consumer products, I'm betting that Activision Blizzard has what it takes to be a long-term winner.

This stock brought some luster to this Fool's portfolio
Sean Williams (Silver Standard Resources): Picking out the stock that changed my life is simple: Silver Standard Resources, which came by way of its purchase of Claude Resources in 2016. It was through Claude Resources, and now Silver Standard Resources, that I learned how lucrative buy-and-hold investing could be.
I began nibbling on shares of Claude Resources more than five years ago, with the belief that a couple of simple turnarounds would fix its issues. Claude has been holding an asset that wasn't economically feasible to develop, given its debt situation and falling spot gold prices. It was also seeing higher-than-necessary mining costs at its flagship Seabee mine and was a couple of years away from a major expansion of the Santoy Gap. If I had put myself into the CEO's shoes, I would have restructured the debt, sold off non-core assets, and worked to lower mining costs. Lo and behold, that's exactly what happened.
In late 2013, Claude announced that it had sold the Madsen Project -- the aforementioned asset that it couldn't feasibly develop -- for cash and stock considerations to Laurentian Goldfields, and it wound up restructuring its debt not too long after. More importantly, it found ways to reduce its all-in sustaining costs at Seabee and bring the Santoy Gap online ahead of schedule. Before I knew it, Claude was generating more than 70,000 ounces of annual gold production when it had historically been stuck around 50,000 ounces of annual gold production. Best of all, it was generating positive cash flow and a profit.
In March 2016, Silver Standard Resources offered to acquire Claude Resources in what was essentially an all-stock deal -- the cash component was laughably small. Since the value of the two companies was intricately linked, the 32% premium to Claude's closing price on the day the deal was announced turned into a nearly 100% premium by the time the deal closed three months later. Since then, Santoy Gap production has increased, and I've seen my investment grow more than sevenfold.
Since my initial nibble, and through today, I've yet to sell a single share -- and I see no reason to start now. Silver Standard generates a little over 80% of its sales from gold production and is soon changing its name to SSR Mining to reflect this shift in production -- at a time when physical silver and gold  look poised to increase in value. Uncertainty surrounding Brexit and Trump's presidency, rising inflation levels, and constrained gold and silver supply are all reasons to believe Silver Standard's margins can improve as spot metals rise and the company aims to keep spending under control. Plus, a new joint venture in Argentina should help reignite its silver production beginning in the second half of 2018.
If there's a stock that's changed this Fool's life, it's Silver Standard Resources. n

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/29/when-simple-math-is-wrong.aspx,2017-05-29,"
""It's simple math,"" she said. ""$100,000 is less than $150,000 -- it's like earning a free $50,000.""
My wife and I were being pitched a timeshare.
Our salesperson was offering a value proposition she thought was unbeatable: If we paid $100,000 for this timeshare, we'd save roughly $150,000 (she was rounding) in lodging costs over the next 20 years.
There was only one problem: Her central premise -- that $100,000 is less than $150,000 -- was wrong.

A powerful concept
Before you send me back to second-grade math class, let's consider the time value of money: Money today is inherently more valuable than the same amount in the future.
""Obviously,"" you may be thinking to yourself, ""since inflation reduces the value of money in future years. That's why my work gives me that 2% cost-of-living adjustment each year."" So $100 a year from now might only purchase the same amount as $98 today. Which makes $100 today inherently more valuable.
But that's not actually the primary principle at play here -- it's what you can do with that money today to make it grow, so that it will be worth more a year from now.
I'm talking about investing in the stock market.
Over the past 100+ years, the S&P 500 (large-cap U.S. stocks) has returned an average of 7% annually after accounting for inflation.
For me, the key word in the preceding sentence is ""average."" To achieve 7% annual returns, you didn't have to recognize Amazon's potential early, pore through clinical trials to find the best HIV drugs and model out their sales, or shell out $400 for a (sham) day-trading course.
You didn't have to do something brilliant or have great foresight. All you had to do was be average. And invested.
With the advent of the index fund, whose job is to passively track an index (like the S&P 500) and deliver comparable returns, it's easier than ever to get those gains. (In fact, even the world's greatest stock picker recommends it.)
The timeshare salesperson didn't understand (or was ignoring) the time value of money.
$100,000 > $150,000
To demonstrate the power of this principle, let's work the math on that timeshare I was offered. I will show you how $100,000 today is worth a great deal more than $150,000 over the next 20 years.
We came to that $150,000 number because my wife and I usually travel for about three weeks a year -- 21 days -- and expect to spend about $150 a night on hotels. That works out to $3,150 in lodging expenses this year. The travel industry has seen 8% inflation over the last few years, so the salesperson assumed that we'd see that annual inflation permanently over the next 20 years. That level of sustained inflation in discretionary spending is unheard of, but let's just assume it's accurate.
So year one expenses of $3,150 grow 8% in year two to $3,402...all the way to year 20 expenses of $13,594. The sum of spending during those 20 years? $144,150.
Yet $100,000 today is worth more.
Let's say that my wife and I put that $100,000 in the stock market and earn an average of 7% gains per year over the next 20 years. We pay for lodging expenses out of our annual income and don't touch that $100,000 the whole time. Over 20 years, that $100,000 grows to $386,968 before taxes.

If you assume that we sell our index funds and ""cash out"" at the end of year 20, we would likely pay a 15% long-term capital gains tax rate (which is the 2017 rate for married filing jointly households making more than $75,900 and less than $470,701). That leaves us with $328,923, or $184,773 in net extra household cash after we subtract the $144,150 we paid out for lodging expenses.

A massive win for time value of money -- to say nothing of the benefit of vacationing in a bunch of different places without being tied to wherever timeshares exist.

            });
        

But only if you're smart about it
It is so easy to lose most of that extra cash if you don't maximize the time value of money.
Let's pretend, instead, that my wife and I decide that the $100,000 is our travel lodging fund for the next 20 years. If we aren't going to spend it on a timeshare, we'll allocate it to hotels instead. We pay our lodging expenses out of the fund each year, and as a result we have to invest the $100,000 more conservatively and put more money into cash. (After all, you shouldn't invest in stocks with money that you plan to use in the next five years -- who can predict the next market downturn?) We achieve a 4.5% annual growth rate, and as mentioned above, we subtract lodging expenses each year from that fund.
We still end up ahead...but by a lot less (roughly $8,000 instead of $185,000). That's for three reasons:
A) We achieve a lower annual growth rate (4.5% instead of 7%). That reduces our gains by about $146,000.
B) We withdraw money from the fund every year. The loss of that capital compounding reduces things by roughly $58,000.
C) Taxes further reduce our gains. Since we have to pay capital gains taxes each year on the amount that we sell out of the index fund, we pay an effective 15% surcharge every year on that money. That reduces returns by another $30,000 -- which is less than the $58,000 we pay in the scenario above, but only because our returns are so much lower.
Here's how that looks in chart form.

We still come out ahead compared to buying a timeshare -- by roughly $8,375.
Use the time value of money to your advantage
The time value of money doesn't just matter when you're buying a time share -- and it doesn't always work in your favor, either. When you take out a 30-year mortgage, that's three decades of payments and interest accruing against you.
Zillow estimates that the current average house is worth $196,500. Let's say you put 20% down (that's $39,300) and finance the remaining $157,200.
Assuming you're charged a 4% annual interest rate on that loan (roughly average as of the time of this writing), then you'll end up paying a whopping $270,179 over the term of that loan.
The numbers get even uglier if you're paying interest on a credit card.
Time value of money is an incredibly powerful principle. The key is to understand when it's working for -- or against -- you, and what those costs entail.
I'm not saying don't ever buy the timeshare. But go into the timeshare negotiation recognizing what that money could be worth when invested -- and demand a price that makes it worth your while.
Recognize the implicit costs of these money decisions, and don't let some slick salesperson make you forget them. Most importantly, remember that time value of money, when properly used, can do amazing things for your wealth.

What do Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR), General Electric (NYSE:GE), and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) all share in common? They're all top-notch stocks that retirees could add to their portfolios right now for generous returns on their investment.
According to three top Motley Fool contributors, each of these companies is offering a discount to investors, but has unique catalysts that could help their share prices climb and their dividends grow. Read on to learn more.

A REIT built for retirement
Travis Hoium (Extra Space Storage): Senior citizens who are staying in the stock market rather than bonds may want to look for companies that can generate consistent cash flow to pay dividends. Extra Space Storage is both a great cash flow company that pays a regular dividend and an tax-efficient investment because it's a real estate investment trust (REIT). 
Extra Space Storage is simply a storage company that builds structures that customers rent a section of for a monthly fee. It's really as simple as that. And you can see below that the company has shown tremendous growth since the recession, and the dividend has risen sharply as a result. 

EXR data by YCharts.
As a REIT, the company has to pay most of its cash flow as a dividend, avoiding paying corporate taxes as a result. And while a recession or another driver of declining demand could lead to a drop in results (and the dividend), the company has its real estate assets to fall back on in a worst-case scenario. That kind of tangible real estate underlying an investment is a great asset for senior citizens, and the 4% dividend yield is a nice payout annually as well.

A new look for an old company
Tyler Crowe (General Electric): Shares of General Electric haven't been lighting the world on fire lately. Over the past three years, the company's stock has only gained a paltry 6% while the S&P 500 has gained 26% over the same time frame. Some of that underperformance can be attributed to headwinds in its oil and gas division, but at the same time, the company is in the middle of a major transformation that will set the stage for what could be decades.
CEO Jeff Immelt has his sights on transforming General Electric from a diversified conglomerate into a focused industrial manufacturer specializing in remote sensing and big data analytics. The combination of the two will not only improve manufacturing and productivity for General Electric but will also provide customers with new unique services like operation optimization and predictive maintenance.  
One example management gave in its December outlook presentation was the oil and gas business. It estimates that after the GE/Baker Hughes merger is finalized, the combined company has an opportunity to improve oil and gas productivity by $200 billion by 2020. For GE, getting customers on board with this product and data analytics service could mean $15 billion in software revenue alone by the end of the decade.
Why this matters for older investors is it will transform General Electric into a business with much higher rates of recurring revenue -- thanks to software subscriptions -- and higher margins that will fuel free cash flow for dividends and share repurchases. These sorts of initiatives are the things investors looking for long-term income want, and at a dividend yield of 3.4%, shares of General Electric look to be a great value pick.

Building on plans for a rebound
Rich Duprey (Lowe's): Taking a flier on a stock that just had a big earnings miss may seem like an odd choice for senior citizens, but Lowe's remains a quality retailer even if it is lagging behind rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD). There are reasons to believe it aims to catch up.
In the DIY center's first-quarter earnings report, comparable sales rose almost 2% and per-share profits of $1.03 missed analyst expectations of better-than-3% comps and $1.06 per share in earnings. Still, in this weakened retail environment, they remain healthy gains, even if they're well behind those its rival.
The main difference seems to be what has always separated the two companies: Home Depot's focus on building contractors and professionals, and Lowe's preference for homeowners. In the robust housing market we've enjoyed, that has put Home Depot ahead, but Lowe's has indicated it intends to remedy that shortfall.
Last week it announced it purchased wholesale retailer Maintenance Supply Headquarters for $512 million, which it said was ""an important step in Lowe's strategy to deepen and broaden its relationship with the pro customer and better serve their needs."" That's on top of the acquisition it made late last year for Central Wholesaler, another pro-based business that would serve the multifamily housing market.
That should help change the dynamic at Lowe's, which has typically relied upon the sale of big-ticket items for a good part of its revenue. Appliances, for example, account for 11% of sales, along with fashion fixtures, which accounts for another 10%. In contrast, Home Depot's biggest category is indoor garden, which represents slightly more than 9% of total revenue, meaning Big Orange is getting a lot more customers making a lot more smaller purchases.
Lowe's has been moving more toward the pro consumer, and its latest acquisitions show it's serious about the endeavor, which means the gap between the two should start to narrow, and the earnings disappointment this time around likely won't be repeated.
With a dividend of $1.40 per share that yields 1.7%, it's no barnburner for sure, but the DIY home improvement center remains a steady performer whose drop in price provides an entry point for investors looking for stability, the current quarter notwithstanding.

The stock market performed well on Wednesday, as the S&P 500 rose to a record high and other major benchmarks also posted solid gains of between a third and a half of a percent. The Federal Reserve captured most of the attention of investors today, with the release of its latest policy committee minutes suggesting how it intends to reduce the size of its balance sheet over time. Most market participants seemed pleased with the idea that artificial support of the economy was no longer needed, and that helped set a positive tone on Wall Street. Yet some companies had bad news to report, and Dycom Industries (NYSE:DY), Chico's FAS (NYSE:CHS), and Bristow Group (NYSE:BRS) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Dycom deals with disappointment
Shares of Dycom Industries dropped 18% even though it reported solid fiscal third-quarter financial results. The telecommunications infrastructure specialist said that its revenue climbed 18% from year-ago levels, resulting in a 20% jump in adjusted earnings. Yet some investors weren't pleased that the pace of the company's organic growth slowed to its worst level in nearly two years, and forecasts for the coming quarter were substantially lower than those following the stock had expected to see. Given expected demand for telecom infrastructure services as major network carriers work on rolling out updated wireless networks, Dycom's fundamental business seems sound, and if that's the case, then today's decline might eventually prove to be a head-fake for long-term investors in the company.

Chico's hits a multiyear low
Chico's stock finished the day down 11% after the women's clothing and accessories retailer released its first-quarter earnings report. Sales fell more than 9% on an 8.7% drop in comparable sales, with widespread weakness throughout its operations. Chico's is hardly the only retailer that's facing difficult conditions right now, but the extent to which the company is seeing its business deteriorate has sent the stock to its worst levels in nearly seven years. With the company expecting mid-single-digit percentage declines in comps for the entire 2017 fiscal year, Chico's investors will have to get used to sluggish conditions for the foreseeable future.

            });
        

Bristow has a hard landing
Finally, shares Bristow Group plunged more than 35%. The helicopter services specialist suffered a more dramatic loss than expected as sales fell 14% from year-ago levels, and Bristow projected that conditions in fiscal 2018 are unlikely to improve markedly from the current slump. The main problem is that Bristow relies on extensive levels of activity in the offshore drilling industry, and with crude oil prices remaining at relatively low levels, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies simply aren't doing as much high-cost exploratory activity in the offshore realm. Until the energy industry bounces back more extensively, it'll be hard for Bristow to regain even a portion of the nearly 90% it has lost since mid-2014.

Wednesday was a good day for stocks, and the Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 both climbed through milestone levels. Most market participants attributed the positive sentiment to the Federal Reserve, which released the minutes of its latest monetary policy meeting during the afternoon. The central bank revealed plans to clamp down on the size of its balance sheet, which it initially expanded in the aftermath of the financial crisis to provide liquidity to the bond market and additional stimulus to the U.S. economy. Investors were pleased that the Fed believes that it's no longer necessary to extend that level of monetary accommodation to the economy. In addition, some individual companies had extremely good news, and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), Triumph Group (NYSE:TGI), and Puma Biotechnology (NASDAQ:PBYI) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Abercrombie & Fitch looks at a potential buyout
Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch climbed 6% in the wake of reports that the teen retailer might receive an acquisition bid from a consortium of investors. According to The Wall Street Journal (subscription required), industry peer American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) and private equity company Cerberus Capital Management are looking at putting together a potential buyout offer for Abercrombie & Fitch, following speculation that other players in the industry might also be interested in consolidation. A&F has been dealing with takeover speculation for a while, and it has typically noted that any discussions wouldn't necessary translate into actual offers. Yet with Abercrombie set to release its first-quarter financial results Thursday, investors will want to see signs that the company can take care of its challenges on its own -- or else they'll start clamoring more loudly for a buyout to take place.

Triumph reports earnings, resolves dispute
Triumph Group stock soared over 30% after the company announced its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results and resolved a dispute with aircraft manufacturer Bombardier. The aerospace components and systems specialist said that sales fell 13% from year-ago levels, and it posted a GAAP loss of $126.8 million. With challenges in its aerospace structures business, Triumph has focused on amending contracts and addressing operational and financial challenges, and the company's transformation plan has led to improving free cash flow and cost savings. Investors were also happy that Triumph reached a settlement of all of its disputes with Bombardier. Triumph said that the agreement ""resets the commercial relationship between [Triumph] and Bombardier and allows each of them to better achieve their business objectives going forward.""

Puma gets a thumbs-up
Finally, shares of Puma Biotechnology jumped 30%. The biopharmaceutical company earned a hoped-for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel looking at its neratinib candidate treatment for breast cancer. The panel voted 12 to 4 in favor of recommending the drug to the FDA, and although panelists expressed some thoughts about potentially limiting the size of the group of women eligible to use the drug, investors nevertheless took the news as a positive. The FDA still needs to make its own decision about Puma's drug, and it isn't bound by the opinion of the advisory panel. Nevertheless, today's recommendation moves Puma one step further to getting a big win under its belt, and shareholders recognized that fact with the second big move in the stock this week.

Some positive economic and consumer data hit the news cycle Friday, as both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 ended up 1.3% and 1.4% for the week. The latest reading of first-quarter GDP was revised higher, bouncing from 0.7% to 1.2% -- still not at the level investors would like, but at least growth appears better than initially expected. Next, The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment rating checked in at 97.1 in May, which was a little better than expected. 
But not all the news was that positive in the markets this week. Here are some companies that made big moves or big headlines.
Detroit woes
Monday morning brought a surprise announcement from Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), when it appointed Jim Hackett as CEO to replace Mark Fields. Hackett was formerly the head of Ford Smart Mobility, and the board of directors is hoping he'll be the second coming of Alan Mulally.

It's an intriguing move, and there are reasons for investors to be optimistic. Consider that Hackett was previously credited with turning around Steelcase as its CEO, and he even helped revive an iconic athletic department at the University of Michigan. Those are wildly different turnarounds, and if the processes, procedures, or simply management style is the root of these success stories, this may be the right move for Ford to make. 
Significant moves are already being made. Hackett is narrowing Ford's operating committee to seven direct reports, compared with Fields' 18-19 reports, according to RBC analysts Joseph Spak and George Clark. Then on Thursday, Ford announced another slew of global executive changes in hopes that the company will become less bureaucratic and more focused on adapting quickly toward a future of smart mobility and driverless-vehicle technology. 
Back from the dead?
Only a few years after most of the investing community left it for dead, and thanks to concerns over its business model and the threat Amazon.com poses, Best Buy Co. (NYSE:BBY) soared nearly 20% in intra-day trading Thursday, after the company released its first-quarter results.
The company's revenue recorded a modest 1% gain to $8.53 billion but managed to beat analysts' estimates by about $220 million. Perhaps even more positive was that comparable-store sales grew by 1.6% during the first quarter, which was a turnaround from declining comparable sales during the prior year's first quarter. Also helping to battle against Amazon concerns, Best Buy is proving it has online ambitions of its own and posted a 22.5% gain in domestic sales on the web.
Best Buy's adjusted earnings per share checked in at $0.60, which was a drastic $0.17 higher than the prior year's result and $0.20 better than analysts' estimates. Gross margin improved by 60 basis points, up to 23.6%. It was a strong quarter overall for a company left for dead years ago.

Not back from the dead
On the same day Best Buy rebounded with a strong quarter, another retailer left for dead years ago also jumped more than 10% after releasing its own first-quarter results. But that's where most of the similarities end.
Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD) posted first-quarter results that weren't as poor as analysts had expected, but that's not to say they were good. Revenue dropped 20% from the prior year's quarter, down to $4.3 billion, which still managed to best analysts' estimates calling for a meager $3.96 billion. In a similar fashion, Sears' bottom line checked in with a big loss of $2.15 per share, beating the $3.05 loss analysts were anticipating. 
Chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert put his best spin on the first quarter in the press release: ""While this was certainly a challenging quarter for our company, it was also one that clearly demonstrated our commitment to return Sears Holdings to solid financial footing.""

Despite the minor bounce in the stock price Thursday, trying to revive its business model in decaying malls seems akin to climbing Mount Everest at this point. If management can pull it off, it would be a story for the business books over the next two decades. But chances are this is merely a speed bump on the way to an inevitable bankruptcy.

",What Investors Missed in the Market This Week
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/27/why-enbridge-inc-is-a-dividend-investors-dream.aspx,2017-05-27,"
If I were to lay out my criteria for a dream dividend stock, it would have the following five characteristics:

A history of paying an eye-catching dividend.
The company supports the payout with relatively stable cash flow.
Comfortably covers the dividend by generating substantial excess cash.
It has an investment-grade credit rating with improving metrics.
Finally, it has a clearly visible growth plan that should take the payout higher in the future.

While I know that's asking a lot, the good news is that several stocks do fit those criteria. One company that certainly fits the bill is Enbridge (NYSE:ENB), which has the potential to be an outstanding income stock for long-term investors.

Image source: Getty Images.

An impressive past and present
Enbridge has long been an excellent income stock, paying a dividend to investors for the past 64 years. Furthermore, it has increased that payout in each of the past 22 years and by an average compound annual rate of 11.2%. The only downside is that because it's a Canadian company, it pays dividends in Canadian dollars, which means that the quarterly rate for American investors can fluctuate a bit with exchange rates. However, even with that minor variation, the stock is still worth considering because at the current combination of the exchange rate and market price Enbridge yields 4.2%, which is more than twice what the average stock in the S&P 500 yields. 
Rock-solid cash flow
One of the reasons Enbridge has been able to pay a generously growing dividend is due to the security of its cash flow. Currently, 96% of its earnings come from stable and predictable take-or-pay and equivalent contracts as well as regulated assets. That's one of the highest percentages in the energy infrastructure sector, with rivals Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) and TransCanada (NYSE:TRP), for example, at 91% and 95%, respectively. TransCanada was only at 92% last year but has caught up by acquiring additional fee-based assets and jettisoning those with less stable cash flow. 




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-8868');
            });
        

Plenty of room to spare
Not only does Enbridge generate very stable cash flow, but it only plans to pay out 50% to 60% of it in dividends each year, retaining the rest to help finance expansion projects. While that's a bit higher than TransCanada's roughly 40% payout ratio and Kinder Morgan's current 25% ratio, it's still very conservative in the energy infrastructure sector, as most companies pay out more than 80% of their cash flow. Meanwhile, the only reason Kinder Morgan's payout ratio is so low at the moment is that the company slashed its dividend 75% a few years ago to ease concerns about its growing leverage.

Image source: Getty Images.

Giving credit where credit is due
Enbridge, like both TransCanada and Kinder Morgan, has an investment-grade credit rating. What's interesting is that its credit rating is higher than Kinder Morgan's despite ending last year with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.2, which is on the high side considering that Kinder Morgan's credit concerns heightened as its leverage crept toward 6.0 times. That said, with a higher percentage of cash flow coming from stable fees and a lower dividend payout ratio, Enbridge can handle that higher leverage. Furthermore, the reason Enbridge has an elevated debt level at the moment is that it's in the midst of a major expansion phase. Once those projects enter service, the incremental earnings will bring the leverage ratio down, with the company expecting to end this year at 5.5 times, which is just above the 5.4 times leverage ratio that Kinder Morgan expects to have at the end of this year. Meanwhile, Enbridge sees that number hitting 4.3 times by 2019 once the rest of its current slate of expansion projects start generating earnings, which is well below its 5.0 times target.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-93048');
            });
        

A pipeline of growth opportunities
Those growth projects will not only deliver a significant improvement to Enbridge's leverage, but they'll provide the company with substantial annual cash flows. Under the company's expectations, available cash flow from operations will increase by 12% to 14% per year through 2019 as a result of the projects it currently has under development. Meanwhile, with the largest backlog of growth projects in the industry, Enbridge believes it can grow its dividend by 10% to 12% annually all the way through 2024. That's by far the best growth forecast in the sector since, for example, TransCanada only expects to grow its dividend by 8% to 10% per year through 2020, while Kinder Morgan has yet to restart dividend growth.
Investor takeaway
Enbridge checks all the boxes for what an investor could want in an income stock. It pays a generous, well-supported dividend that will likely grow at a healthy rate for years to come. That combination of characteristics makes it a dream stock for income-seeking investors.

Warren Buffett is known as one of the best stock pickers of all time, and many of the stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio have performed extremely well for the company. In fact, over the past year alone, nine of Berkshire's stocks have generated nearly $20 billion in returns.
Berkshire's most successful stocks of the past year
As of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly four dozen stocks, but there's a massive variety when it comes to the size of these investments, ranging from just a few million dollars to more than $30 billion for Kraft Heinz, Berkshire's largest stock investment.

Because of this, some of Berkshire's stocks have the potential to contribute more to Berkshire's bottom line than others. With that in mind, here are the stocks that generated the most gains for Berkshire over the past year.

To be clear, all the gains listed in the ""stock price gain"" column are just on paper at this point. Berkshire doesn't actually get the cash until it sells.
It's also worth mentioning that these aren't necessarily Berkshire's best performing stocks -- in fact, with a gain of just 1.5% over the past year, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) underperformed the S&P 500 by a significant margin. However, the stock is a dividend machine, and Berkshire owns a lot of shares, so it still had one of the best returns in the portfolio.
An abundance of bank stocks produced billions in profit
It shouldn't come as much of a surprise that more than half of the chart is made up of financial-sector companies, as the sector was the best performer after November's election. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is a relatively small investment in Berkshire's portfolio, but a massive 42% gain catapulted it into being one of the best performers.
It's also important to note that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the stock that added the most value to Berkshire's portfolio, isn't actually owned by Berkshire -- not yet, anyway. Instead, Berkshire owns warrants, which give it the right to buy 700 million shares of Bank of America for $5 billion, or about $7.14 each. Buffett has said that he fully intends to exercise the warrants at some point before they expire, but for the time being, the intrinsic value of the warrant rises along with Bank of America's stock price.

One stock is missing from the chart
You may have noticed that there are only eight stocks in the chart, not nine as the headline would suggest. I've deliberately left out Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as it's a relatively new investment for Berkshire, and it hasn't owned the bulk of its Apple position for a year just yet. Berkshire's Apple stake was initiated in the first quarter of 2016, and was relatively small at that time, at 10 million shares.
Since then, Buffett has increased Berkshire's stake to 133 million shares, and the position is definitely profitable by more than a billion dollars, so it's worth mentioning here. And for the record, the stocks in the chart collectively returned about $17.7 billion, so the $20 billion figure in the introduction came from combining these returns with Apple's gains.
Even so, since we don't know exactly when all the Apple shares were purchased, or for how much, it's impossible to analyze how much Berkshire has made from it over the past 12 months.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/19/ask-a-fool-what-does-a-stock-split-mean-to-me.aspx,2017-05-19,"
Q: One of my stocks just announced a split. Will my investment be worth twice as much?
A stock split doesn't increase the value of your investment -- at least not directly. For example, if you own 100 shares of a stock that trades for $80 and it splits 2-for-1, you'll own 200 shares with a value of $40 each after the split is completed. The total value of your investment is still $8,000.
Having said that, the primary motivation for a company to split its stock in most circumstances is to maintain a share price in a certain range, which helps keep the stock affordable to smaller investors and allows people to invest more of their money.
Let's say that you have $1,500 to invest and want to buy shares of Amazon, which costs about $968 per share as I write this. At the current share price, you could only afford to buy a single share, leaving $532 of your money uninvested.
On the other hand, if Amazon were to split its shares 10-for-1, its share price would drop to $96.80 and each share would represent one-tenth of the equity that it currently does. Now, your $1,500 can buy 15 shares, which would leave just $48 of your money on the sidelines. I don't think Amazon will necessarily split its stock anytime soon, but if it did, it would allow smaller investors to put more of their money into the company. This can (and often does) create buying pressure on a stock after it splits, and cause the price to rise as investors can put more of their money into the stock.
The bottom line is that while the split won't technically give you more equity in the company, a stock split can potentially result in a boost in the share price.

",Ask a Fool: What Does a Stock Split Mean for Me?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/25/bullish-on-nvidia-youll-love-these-stocks.aspx,2017-05-25,"
Shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) have rallied more than 210% over the past 12 months, fueled by robust demand for its gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and CPUs for connected cars. But after that huge run, NVIDIA now trades at 53 times earnings -- more than double the industry average of 26 for semiconductor makers.
Therefore, investors might hesitate to buy NVIDIA at these levels, especially with the market hovering near historic highs. So for investors who like NVIDIA's growth story but don't like its premium valuation, here are two alternative plays to consider -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).

AMD
AMD is NVIDIA's main rival in discrete GPUs. According to research firm JPR, AMD controlled 29.5% of the market at the end of 2016, compared to NVIDIA's 70.5% share. AMD generally sells cheaper GPUs than NVIDIA, which helped it carve out a loyal niche among budget PC gamers. 
AMD has been aggressively striking back at NVIDIA in GPUs and Intel in CPUs with new products. On the GPU front, it launched new low-end VR-ready GPUs with its Polaris chipset to challenge NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal cards last year. It also plans to launch a preemptive strike against NVIDIA's next-gen Volta cards with its Vega-based cards later this year.

In CPUs, AMD is challenging Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors with its new Ryzen chips -- which reportedly offer comparable performance as Intel's top-tier eight-core chips at about half the price. These fresh catalysts could significantly strengthen its computing and graphics business over the next few quarters. 
AMD also dominates modern gaming consoles by supplying custom SoCs for the PS4 and Xbox One, which have since become a pillar of growth for its EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) unit.
Analysts expect these tailwinds to lift AMD's revenue by 13% this year, while its non-GAAP earnings -- which have remained in the red for two straight years -- are expected to bounce back into the black. AMD has rallied 180% over the past 12 months on that optimism, but it still isn't that expensive at 2.1 times sales, which is much lower than the industry average price-to-sales ratio of 4 for semiconductor makers.
Qualcomm
Qualcomm's 8% gain over the past 12 months looks paltry relative to NVIDIA's and AMD's gains, but that's because the mobile chipmaker has been weighed down by a series of ongoing legal battles with regulators and smartphone makers.

Since those battles are mainly centered on the mobile device market, Qualcomm is aggressively expanding into adjacent markets -- like wearables, connected cameras, drones, and connected cars -- to diversify its business. A big part of that push is challenging NVIDIA's rapidly growing business of connected cars.
Last year, Qualcomm launched Snapdragon Automotive chips to counter the growing adoption of NVIDIA's Tegra chips in infotainment and navigation systems in connected cars. Qualcomm will also close its $47 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world, later this year. 
That purchase will give Qualcomm NXP's BlueBox platform for driverless cars, which directly competes against NVIDIA's Drive PX platform. Since NXP sells a large variety of other automotive chips, Qualcomm will likely employ bundling strategies to gain market share against NVIDIA in the automotive market, which might make the former a better long-term play on connected cars than the latter.
Qualcomm's legal troubles won't end anytime soon, but the NXP deal could transform its business model into a more balanced one, instead of one that relies heavily on a high-margin licensing business propping up a lower-margin one that makes mobile chipsets. 
Analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and earnings (excluding the NXP deal) to dip 3% and 4%, respectively, this year. That sounds dismal, but the stock's price to earnings of 20 remains lower than the industry average of 26 for semiconductor makers, and its forward dividend yield of 3.9% is much higher than S&P 500's current yield of 2%.

            });
        

The key takeaways
I doubt NVIDIA will lose its footing anytime soon, thanks to its market-leading positions in GPUs and automotive CPUs. However, the stock could certainly stagnate as investors fret over its valuations. 
So, in the meantime, investors should keep AMD and Qualcomm in mind as alternative plays on GPUs and connected cars. There's no guarantee that either stock will outperform NVIDIA this year, but they could be lifted by the same rising tides that are boosting NVIDIA's growth.

Tuesday was another solid day for stocks, and a rising Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all helped sustain positive sentiment toward the prospects for the economy, especially in the U.S. market. Gains for the major benchmarks weren't all that substantial, but they still reflected the overall optimism that Americans have about the current state of affairs. Despite ongoing political and global economic uncertainties, most market participants seemed willing to look on the bright side as they anticipate seeing more economic data over the next week and a half.
Yet some stocks didn't hold up as well as the overall market, and Herbalife (NYSE:HLF), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN), and Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF-A) (NYSE:BF-B) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Herbalife falls on China nervousness
Shares of Herbalife closed down 6% as investors reacted negatively to news of the departure of a key executive in the company's Chinese operations. Li Yanliang, president of the Herbalife China unit, was removed from his role, according to a Chinese news source familiar with the company. Many investors seemed shocked by the move, especially given that Herbalife had seen much faster growth in sales in China than it has in its overall worldwide operations. Even with the pullback, Herbalife stock trades near its best levels in three years, but any lingering questions about the vitally important business in China could cause the stock's recent rally to take a pause until the matter is resolved to investors' satisfaction.

Alexion also sees executive departures
Alexion Pharmaceuticals stock dropped 9% after the company also suffered defections from the corporate suite. The biopharma said that CFO David Anderson, Chief Commercial Officer Carsten Thiel, R&D head Martin Mackay, and Chief Human Resources Officer Clare Carmichael will all be leaving the company, with Thiel and Carmichael's departures effective as of June, Anderson's in August, and Mackay's at the end of 2017. Alexion appointed Brian Goff as Thiel's replacement for chief commercial officer, but the company will have to do a search to fill the other three vacancies. The move comes amid dramatic turnover at Alexion, with CEO Ludwig Hantson having been on the job only since March. Once things settle down among the executive ranks, Alexion could bounce back, but for now, investors don't appear willing to wait and see how things play out.

Brown-Forman has a turbulent day
Finally, shares of Brown-Forman finished the day down 6%. The maker of Jack Daniel's and other spirits saw some wild swings late in the day, with the stock briefly spiking 5% higher on news that Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) was interested in making a takeover bid for its alcohol-industry peer. Yet those gains quickly evaporated when Brown-Forman rebuffed Constellation Brands, saying that it isn't interested in making a sale. The downward move gave up all of Brown-Forman's share-price gains from Monday, which had gone largely unexplained at the time. Given the power of the Jack Daniel's brand, it's entirely possible that Constellation could be back with a higher offer at some point in the future.

The stock market finished Friday with minimal change, hanging onto almost all of its extensive gains for the full week. Investors have proven to be unflappable recently, and even geopolitical pressures stemming from President Trump's appearance at Italy's G7 summit didn't cause any consternation in the financial markets. With earnings season coming to an end, most are now looking at whether the Federal Reserve will keep acting to tighten monetary policy at its June meeting. Yet despite relatively solid optimism about the market's prospects overall, some stocks lost ground. Zoe's Kitchen (NYSE:ZOES), Beazer Homes (NYSE:BZH), and BioCryst Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:BCRX) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Zoe's can't serve up a good quarter
Shares of Zoe's Kitchen fell 12.5% after the Mediterranean restaurant chain's first-quarter financial report failed to live up to the expectations of investors. Zoe's saw its sales climb almost 13%, but that was weaker than most of those following the stock had expected, and a 3.3% decline in comparable-restaurant sales was also disappointing. Operating income dropped by almost two-fifths, and Zoe's had to reduce its full-year sales and comps guidance, now expecting comparable-restaurant sales that at best will be flat and could fall as much as 3%. The $5 million to $11 million reduction in revenue guidance took the new range to $314 million to $322 million, and that disappointed growth-oriented investors who don't want to see continued slowdowns. Until Zoe's re-establishes its former pace of growth, many shareholders will have doubts about the company's future.

Beazer gets a bad review
Beazer Homes stock dropped 8.3% in the wake of an analyst downgrade. Analysts at JMP Securities cut their rating on the homebuilder from market perform to underperform, and they put a $12-per-share target on the stock, working out to about 8% more downward pressure on the stock even after today's decline. Beazer has actually done a fairly good job of sustaining positive performance even as mortgage rates have risen from their recent lows, and in its most recent quarter, Beazer posted sales gains of nearly 12%. Many have been nervous about how much longer the housing market can expand, but at least for now, Beazer has defied skeptics, and it's entirely possible that JMP will prove to have been wrong -- or at least early -- in its negative call on the homebuilder stock.

            });
        

BioCryst gives back some of its gains
Finally, shares of BioCryst Pharmaceuticals ended the day down 14.3%. However, the downward move followed Thursday's 31% jump in the stock, stemming from favorable analysis results for its BCX7353 candidate treatment for hereditary angioedema. The good news included no serious safety problems connected with the drug and reductions in frequency of attacks when taking the medication. Yet some investors expect BioCryst to take advantage of the run-up in its stock to raise cash through a secondary offering, and that -- along with some profit-taking from traders -- might have justified today's decline. Even after the drop, BioCryst still has gained more than 13% in the past two days, and many see more upside for the small biotech going forward.

The stock market continued to gain ground on Tuesday, with major benchmarks rising back toward key levels. The S&P 500 finished the day just below the 2,400 mark, and the Dow remains close to 21,000. Market participants pointed to the Trump administration's budget proposals as having no real surprises, and they were generally satisfied with the lack of drama surrounding its release. At the same time, several individual companies had good news that helped keep the mood on Wall Street positive. Diana Shipping (NYSE:DSX), AK Steel (NYSE:AKS), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Diana ships a solid quarter
Shares of Diana Shipping climbed 8% in the wake of the release of the company's first-quarter earnings report. The shipping company saw revenue rise slightly, and Diana's net loss narrowed a bit from year-ago levels. More encouraging was the fact that the size of Diana's fleet grew, and average daily charter rates were up 14% even as daily average operating expenses fell by more than 11% from where they were during the first quarter of 2016. Investors following the shipping company had expected wider losses, but the real question facing Diana Shipping is whether the global economy will recover adequately to restore international shipping volumes to past levels. If that happens, then better industry conditions could lift Diana shares a lot further.

AK Steel gets a key sign-off
AK Steel stock strengthened by 9% after getting good news from a regulatory agency. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration had been investigating allegations of hazardous conditions at the Middletown Works worksite, with a March letter to the agency stating that hazards included a lack of certification among welders and the failure to keep welding logs for certification purposes. AK Steel responded at the time that it had indeed certified almost 200 of its workers as welders, and OSHA concluded that the case should be closed because the hazardous conditions alleged did not in fact exist. That's good news for a company that has already had plenty of other things to worry about, including difficult industry conditions and competitive efforts from other steelmaking rivals.

            });
        

Take-Two posts winning earnings
Finally, shares of Take-Two Interactive climbed over 5%. The video-game maker released its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results Tuesday morning, which included full-year revenue gains of 26% and a 19% rise in bookings from the company. For the fourth quarter alone, sales jumped by more than half on strength in key franchise offerings, including Mafia, Grand Theft Auto, and various sports-related offerings. The results were even strong enough to offset the bad news that Red Dead Redemption 2 won't be released until next April at the earliest, which will mean that Take-Two won't see any positive impact from the release during the coming fiscal year. As entertainment options continue to perform strongly, it'll be important for Take-Two to keep up the pace and continue to deliver the new game offerings that its customers want. If it does, though, further share-price gains are possible.

Sometimes income investors blindly chase yield. Big mistake. 
Sure, you might enjoy a couple of quarters of nice payments, but if the underlying business isn't built to sustain them, the well is going to go dry. 
The real key to dividend investing is finding quality companies built for the long term that will pass along their success to individual investors. 
With that in mind, our contributors think Coach (NYSE:COH) Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) are all rock-solid dividend stocks -- here's why. 

Source: Getty Images

The House of Mouse 
Dylan Lewis (Disney) - Disney has a bit of an odd dividend history, shifting the cadence of their payments from quarterly, to annually, before eventually landing on its current bi-annual calendar. The company's current 1.4% yield might not seem super attractive to income investors, but I prefer to focus on the room that the dividend has to grow, and the incredible value Disney shares are currently trading at. 
On a trailing basis, Disney is trading at 18.5 times earnings. With the S&P 500 solidly in the mid-20's and growing concerns over a ""rich"" market, there aren't too many high quality companies trading that far below the broader market. 
Disney's ""cheap"" status is thanks to concerns as the company repositions its cash cow ESPN property for the cord-cutting world. But those worries ignore the broader success of the business thanks to the parks and resorts and studio entertainment segments. On top of its strong portfolio of cable brands, Disney also controls some of the world's most recognizable film franchises (see: Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel), and the company has proven its ability to monetize them through franchise extensions, merchandise and park attractions time and time again.
Because the company doesn't pay every quarter Disney's dividend calendar can skew metrics like the payout ratio, so don't be fooled by the 26% you'll often see cited off quick calculations. It's actually closer to 51%. But even at that level, the company has plenty of room to increase, even if income flatlines. The last hike came in at 10%, and I wouldn't be surprised to see more of the same in coming years. 
All numbers aside, dividend investors want to know that their money is being put somewhere safe, and Disney's nearly centurylong standing as a cultural institution is proof the company can evolve with consumer tastes and is here to stay. 
A fast-percolating dividend
Keith Noonan (Starbucks): With a 1.7% yield that comes in below the S&P 500 index yield of 1.9% and a seven-year history of dividend payouts that might not look impressive when stacked against the track records of Dividend Aristocrat companies, Starbucks doesn't yet have the qualities that make it a go-to stock for income investors. That could change pretty quickly, however, as the Seattle coffee giant has rapidly built its returned income component and has room to continue making substantial payout increases. Starbucks has boosted its payout 194% over the last five years, delivering roughly 25% growth annually over the stretch, and looks to be an attractive investment from both returned income and growth standpoints.
While the stock does trade at an earnings premium with its forward P/E sitting at roughly 28, strong business momentum points to plenty of opportunity for dividend increases and capital appreciation. Starbucks has grown earnings at an average annual rate of 18.6% over the last five years, and the company anticipates that it will be able to deliver EPS growth between 15% and 20% over the next five years. That's an exciting and ambitious target for a company of Starbucks' size, and maintaining such impressive earnings growth appears achievable as the company increases food sales and premium offerings and orchestrates a dramatic expansion that aims grow its store count from roughly 25,000 locations at the end of 2016 to 37,000 by 2021.
The cost of distributing its current dividend represents less than half of both trailing earnings and free cash flow -- a good indication that shareholders can continue to expect payout growth, and earnings growth represents another likely driver for dividend and share price gains.

A luxury conglomerate 
Rich Duprey (Coach): Having just agreed to acquire Kate Spade (NYSE:KATE) in a $2.4 billion deal, affordable luxury leader Coach is moving forward with its transformation into a luxury conglomerate. The handbag maker seems to have finally moved past the turmoil that decimated its sales just a few years ago, and though its stock has not yet fully recovered from the devastation, the business looks to be on much more solid ground.
The change really came with its acquisition of upscale shoemaker Stuart Weitzman, which has consistently increased sales even when Coach's handbags and accessories have lagged. The purchase, though, was an indication of where it should head. Acquire top-notch brands with a substantial following and allow them to keep their identity. It was hinted at when Coach first wanted to acquire Burberry and then made a pitch to buy Kate Spade. When that seemed to falter, it was floated that Coach was interested in another shoemaker, Jimmy Choo.
These are not small businesses that it can tuck into its operations, but rather full-fledged brands that can continue to stand on their own, despite whatever problems they may be encountering. That puts Coach in the position of becoming the next LVMH Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (NASDAQOTH:LVMHF), which has its own agglomeration of high-end brands.
Yet by buying Kate Spade, Coach is also reaching down to the lower end of the aspirational luxury niche. Like Coach, the rival handbag maker was seeking to become a lifestyle brand with an assortment of merchandise that extended beyond just clutches, purses, and hobos, but at a lower price point than what Coach offers.
There is still risk involved with an investment here. Retail is still a shambles and the shopping mall is becoming a ghost town once again as anchor stores close hundreds of locations each and specialty retailers go bankrupt. Rue21 is just the latest name to go under. Also, by buying a business that's so similar in concept to its own, Coach risks getting no special benefit from the purchase.
Yet Kate Spade does add an instantly recognizable name to its portfolio, and with the design and leadership qualities exhibited by both creative director Stuart Vevers and CEO Victor Luis, the acquisition provides them with another  opportunity to demonstrate their skills. Astute investors will also note that it sports a dividend that pays $1.35 annually that currently yields a healthy 3%; its price-to-earnings ratio is below both the broad market average and that of its industry; and with analysts anticipating earnings will grow at a 10% pace annually for the next few years, there is plenty of room for Coach to grow and regain more of its lost ground.

1. Digital Realty Trust
Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) owns and operates data-center properties, and has done an excellent job of taking advantage of the growing need for data storage. The company has grown its funds from operations at an annualized 14% rate since 2005, and has increased its dividend every year.
Demand for data centers is still growing rapidly, and demand continues to outpace supply in several of Digital Realty's key markets. Cisco believes that cloud-data traffic is expected to grow at an annual rate of more than 30% per year through 2020, so there should be plenty of new opportunities to capitalize on.
2. Public Storage
Self-storage REIT Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) is, by far, the largest and most well-known company in its industry. Most consumers are familiar with the company and its 2,354 U.S. storage facilities, and there are another 200 in Europe.
The self-storage business is quite attractive, primarily because of its low operational expenses. Specifically, it costs far less to maintain, manage, and turn over self-storage space than most other types of real estate. The company has previously said that it can break even with just 30% occupancy, and while its properties are currently well over 90% full, self-storage can take a hit in tough economic times, but the cost advantages should allow Public Storage to earn a nice profit no matter what the economy does.

3. Realty Income
Many investors are hesitant to invest in anything to do with the retail industry, and who could blame them? However, Realty Income (NYSE:O) is a different kind of retail investment.
The company primarily invests in freestanding retail properties, which it leases to tenants that are immune to e-commerce competition, are recession-resistant, or both. Just to name a couple of examples, dollar stores are a big part of Realty Income's portfolio, and these businesses actually tend to do better when the economy is bad and consumers become bargain hunters. And drug stores -- Walgreen's is Realty Income's largest tenant -- sell products that people need, even if the economy turns sour.
In addition, Realty Income's long-term net lease structure locks its tenants in for 15 years or more in most cases, with gradual rent increases built in. The tenants are responsible for the variable expenses of property ownership, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance -- all Realty Income does is find a tenant and enjoy years of predictable income.
4. American Tower
One of the largest REITs in the market, American Tower (NYSE:AMT) owns, operates, and develops wireless and broadcast communications real estate in the U.S. and 14 other countries around the world. The company's portfolio has over 147,000 sites and continues to grow, especially internationally. In the past couple of years alone, American Tower has ventured into the Argentina and France markets, and so far has seen promising results. In fact, American Tower is generating so much cash flow that management expects the dividend to grow at a rate of at least 20% this year, to complement its generous buyback program.

            });
        

5. Ventas
Ventas (NYSE:VTR) is one of the largest REITs focused on healthcare properties. The company owns approximately 1,300 properties, more than half of which (by income) are senior housing, with smaller concentrations in medical offices, life science buildings, hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities.
Healthcare is perhaps the most interesting type of real estate investment from a long-term perspective right now because of the attractive demographic trends that should fuel a period of tremendous growth. In a nutshell, the U.S. population is aging -- fast. The 65-and-older population is expected to roughly double by 2050, and the older (75+ and 85+) age groups are growing even faster. This should create growing healthcare demand, especially for senior housing, and large, financially flexible companies such as Ventas are in a good position to capitalize.
Will these five REITs have another great decade?
To be perfectly clear, a stock's past performance is no guarantee of its future results. Just because these REITs outperformed the market over the past decade doesn't mean they'll continue to do so.
Having said that, there's no reason to believe the strong performance of these five companies won't continue. They have winning business models, are financially solid, and are among the biggest companies in their respective specializations. In fact, in some cases, the past decade has been uncharacteristically weak for these companies. For example, Public Storage and Realty Income have 20-year average total returns of 15% and 14.6%, respectively.
The bottom line is that I'm confident that the strong performance of these REITs will continue throughout next decade (and beyond).

Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are well-known for their higher-than-average dividend yields. However, many investors don't realize the incredible long-term growth potential these companies are capable of. With that in mind, here are five large equity REITs that have tripled investors' money -- or more -- over the past decade.

1. Digital Realty Trust
Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) owns and operates data-center properties, and has done an excellent job of taking advantage of the growing need for data storage. The company has grown its funds from operations at an annualized 14% rate since 2005, and has increased its dividend every year.
Demand for data centers is still growing rapidly, and demand continues to outpace supply in several of Digital Realty's key markets. Cisco believes that cloud-data traffic is expected to grow at an annual rate of more than 30% per year through 2020, so there should be plenty of new opportunities to capitalize on.
2. Public Storage
Self-storage REIT Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) is, by far, the largest and most well-known company in its industry. Most consumers are familiar with the company and its 2,354 U.S. storage facilities, and there are another 200 in Europe.
The self-storage business is quite attractive, primarily because of its low operational expenses. Specifically, it costs far less to maintain, manage, and turn over self-storage space than most other types of real estate. The company has previously said that it can break even with just 30% occupancy, and while its properties are currently well over 90% full, self-storage can take a hit in tough economic times, but the cost advantages should allow Public Storage to earn a nice profit no matter what the economy does.

",These 5 Stocks Tripled Your Money Over the Past 10 Years -- Will They Do It Again?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/26/these-stocks-have-lost-30-so-far-in-2017.aspx,2017-05-26,"
The stock market has put in a strong performance so far in 2017, with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) recently hitting new all-time record highs. But not every stock in the market has shared the success of the broader indexes. In particular, Under Armour (NYSE:UAA), Transocean (NYSE:RIG), and U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) have all lost at least 30% of their value year to date. Given the challenges they face, some investors are concerned that their losses could become even more severe in the months to come.

UAA data by YCharts.
Under Armour sees growth slow
For years, Under Armour was a growth darling in the athletic apparel and footwear industry, building up its business and taking full advantage of demographic trends favoring greater demand for its products. Yet recently, Under Armour has struggled, reporting only single-digit percentage growth in its most recent quarter and making investors increasingly nervous about the company's ability to sustain a high-growth trajectory going forward.
Retail pressures have hurt Under Armour, because many of the sporting goods store chains that carried its products have gone bankrupt or otherwise closed their stores. Some investors are also concerned about whether Under Armour will invest enough in its e-commerce distribution infrastructure to keep up with competitors. Still, international growth remains robust, and both Europe and Japan have seen solid growth rates that point to the prospects for future success as well. In a competitive environment, Under Armour will have to fight harder, but it has the potential to rebound from its losses.

Transocean loses energy
Transocean shares have also been a victim of a tough industry environment, as the oil and gas sector hasn't been able to recover as fully from terrible performance in 2015 as investors had hoped. In particular, Transocean suffers because of its exposure to the offshore drilling industry, where price declines in crude oil have had an especially harsh impact on drilling activity and the need for the company's services. The drilling specialist has worked hard to cut its costs, but there's only so much expense control possible, and utilization rates have plunged on what in the past were some of Transocean's most lucrative assets.
Transocean is now looking at ways that it can bolster its business going forward, and some believe that the offshore drilling specialist will get more aggressive in the near future. In particular, possible moves would include making a major acquisition in an effort to consolidate the market and capture greater pricing power. Transocean is pleased that some projects that used not to be economically viable have seen their breakeven points fall to $40 to $50 per barrel, but what it really needs to see is a sustained push for crude above those levels in order to spur more dramatic demand.

            });
        

U.S. Steel can't deliver
Finally, U.S. Steel has taken a huge hit so far this year. Enthusiasm built up toward the end of 2016, as the incoming Trump administration emphasized the need for infrastructure projects to bolster the U.S. economy. Many saw that as a cue for U.S. Steel to ramp up production of needed materials to support construction efforts. Since then, however, the White House has run into resistance on its domestic agenda, and that has held the steel industry back.
U.S. Steel's most recent quarterly results reflected the disappointment that investors have had. Sales were up 16% from the previous year's period, but the company saw its overhead expenses nearly double compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and that produced a surprise loss for U.S. Steel. Because it waited until now to take on tasks like upgrading its production facilities and seeking to eliminate unnecessary expenses, U.S. Steel hasn't been as quick on the uptake as some of its peers. With years of capital improvements anticipated, it's possible that U.S. Steel will take a lot longer to cash in even if things go well for the steel industry generally.
Losses of 30% are always tough for investors to swallow, and it's smart to reexamine your investing thesis when such losses occur to see if you still have confidence in the stock. Rebounds for all three of these stocks are possible, but they will all depend at least in some part on external factors outside their control in order to succeed.

As for individual stocks, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) made big moves following the companies' quarterly earnings report announcements.
Foot Locker sees lower profits ahead
Foot Locker shares sank nearly 17% after the retailer posted surprisingly weak first-quarter earnings results. Comparable-store sales inched higher by 0.5% to mark a sharp slowdown from the 5% increase it booked in the prior quarter. Revenue gains sped up late in the quarter as delayed income tax refunds began arriving. However, that boost couldn't completely make up for the lost sales. ""The slow start we experienced in February,"" CEO Richard Johnson said in a press release, ""was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April.""

Foot Locker also endured a dip in profitability that suggests it struggled to move some inventory through its system. Gross profit margin fell by a full percentage point to 34% of sales.
Johnson and his team cited ""tremendous appetite for athletic footwear and apparel"" that should see the company through rough patches like this over the long term. Still, the business may struggle to hit management's target of mid-single-digit comps growth in 2017.

Autodesk boosts subscriber rolls
Shares of computer-aided design software specialist Autodesk jumped 15% to a new high following strong fiscal first-quarter results that management paired with a bullish outlook for the remainder of the year. The company booked a 5% decrease in sales, but that decline was actually a good sign since it was powered by customers enthusiastically signing up for subscription contracts. Autodesk is nearly done transitioning its business to a recurring, term-based model, having added 233,000 new customers to its subscription plan.
""We're executing well and making significant progress on our business model transition as evidenced by our first quarter results,"" co-CEO Andrew Anagnost said in a press release. ""Broad-based strength across all subscription types and geographies led to another record quarter for total subscription additions and a fantastic start of the new fiscal year,"" co-CEO Amar Hanspal stated.
The improving demand led management to issue a bullish forecast for the coming quarter that calls for revenue of $488 million to $500 million. Consensus estimates, meanwhile, were aiming for just $488 million of sales. Over the full year, the company believes it will grow its recurring revenue base by 24% to 26% as its subscriber figures climb by between 600,000 and 650,000. That should put the company in a better position to begin generating positive net income for the first time in three fiscal years.

A dirt-cheap renewable-energy stock
Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Renewable Partners): Hydropower and wind generator Brookfield Renewable Partners is the total package for investors. It's a great stock for income lovers because at current market prices it yields a generous 6.2%. That's well above the average yield of its peers, which is closer to 4% these days. Furthermore, the company expects to grow that payout 5% to 9% per year, which puts it on pace to deliver total annual returns in the 12% to 15% range. That makes it a pretty compelling option for growth investors. However, what really puts this stock over the top is the fact that investors can buy that growing income stream for a pretty compelling value these days.
As the following slide shows, the company currently trades at a discount to the value of its assets when compared to where other hydro and wind peers trade in the marketplace:

Data source: Brookfield Renewable Partners.

Because of that, investors can buy Brookfield Renewable Partners for a 15% to 40% discount. However, as that slide also points out, this valuation doesn't give the company any credit for its wind and hydro development pipeline. It's a pipeline that it anticipates will add an incremental $45 million to $50 million in annual cash flow as these assets start generating power over the next few years. In the company's estimation, these developments are currently worth $2 to $3 per unit because that's the value it could get for those projects if it were to sell them to other investors. 
Add it all up and Brookfield Renewable Partners has everything an investor could want in a long-term holding. Not only does it pay an attractive dividend that it expects to grow at a healthy clip over the next several years, but investors can buy that growing income stream for a bargain price.  
Charge ahead with this financial stock
Dan Caplinger (Discover Financial Services): The credit card industry has done extremely well recently, as more businesses and consumers across the globe turn away from cash transactions toward more advanced payment methods. Discover Financial isn't the largest such network, but it has a place among the elite in the industry, and unlike its peers, its stock currently has an attractive valuation of just 10 times its trailing earnings over the past 12 months.
What many people don't know is that Discover goes beyond its namesake credit card. The company has also worked to boost its student loan and personal loan volume, and those efforts have produced double-digit percentage growth, accelerating Discover's growth rate beyond what the credit card portfolio can provide. Returns on equity have also been solid, pointing to the idea that Discover should be able to stand up to its bigger rivals and still hold its own.
Discover has done a number of shareholder-friendly actions, including boosting its dividend consistently over time as well as making extensive repurchases of stock. Some also believe that Discover could make a good acquisition candidate, especially if a major U.S. bank decides that having a well-known payment network under its corporate umbrella could bolster profits. As long as a strong U.S. economy keeps spending levels high, Discover Financial is in a good position to keep performing well.

            });
        

Own the network
Keith Noonan (Cisco Systems): Networking leader Cisco is facing lagging sales for its routing and switching hardware, but its inexpensive valuation and strong dividend component point to an opportunity for long-term investors. The company recently delivered disappointing third-quarter sales and guidance for the current quarter, and, following resulting sell-offs, its stock now trades at just 12 times forward earnings estimates. That's an earnings multiple that compares quite favorably with the S&P 500's forward P/E of 18 and the telecommunications hardware industry average of roughly 26.
As a result of challenges facing its legacy hardware business, Cisco has been investing to build its Internet of Things, cloud, security, and collaboration businesses and reorient itself to derive more revenue from subscriptions rather than one-off sales. The company's move to a more software-focused business model means that significant new revenue streams are being deferred, which could result in additional short-term performance slumps, but shareholders have the benefit of stacking dividend payments as the transition takes place. With a 3.7% yield and the cost of paying its dividend representing roughly 47% of last year's $12.42 billion in free cash flow, the stock looks like a strong income play that comes with the potential for continued payout increases.
Looking at another valuation metric, Cisco has an enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio of roughly 11, meaning that its trailing cash generation represents roughly 9% of its enterprise value and indicating that shares are a good deal at current prices.

Own the network
Keith Noonan (Cisco Systems): Networking leader Cisco is facing lagging sales for its routing and switching hardware, but its inexpensive valuation and strong dividend component point to an opportunity for long-term investors. The company recently delivered disappointing third-quarter sales and guidance for the current quarter, and, following resulting sell-offs, its stock now trades at just 12 times forward earnings estimates. That's an earnings multiple that compares quite favorably with the S&P 500's forward P/E of 18 and the telecommunications hardware industry average of roughly 26.
As a result of challenges facing its legacy hardware business, Cisco has been investing to build its Internet of Things, cloud, security, and collaboration businesses and reorient itself to derive more revenue from subscriptions rather than one-off sales. The company's move to a more software-focused business model means that significant new revenue streams are being deferred, which could result in additional short-term performance slumps, but shareholders have the benefit of stacking dividend payments as the transition takes place. With a 3.7% yield and the cost of paying its dividend representing roughly 47% of last year's $12.42 billion in free cash flow, the stock looks like a strong income play that comes with the potential for continued payout increases.
Looking at another valuation metric, Cisco has an enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio of roughly 11, meaning that its trailing cash generation represents roughly 9% of its enterprise value and indicating that shares are a good deal at current prices.

Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock is lagging behind the S&P 500 Index so far in 2017. That's nothing new, though. Pfizer has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past year, the past three years, the past five years, and the past decade.
Despite this less-than-stellar track record, I bought Pfizer stock earlier this year. I'm counting on the drugmaker's future to be better than it's recent past. Here's why I think the best is yet to come for Pfizer.

Image source: Getty Images.

Promising drugs
Pfizer already has plenty of successful drugs in its lineup. Several of them should be able to grow sales significantly in the future, and Ibrance stands at the top of the list. The cancer drug generated $2.1 billion in revenue last year, but analysts think it could reach peak annual sales of up to $5 billion.
The company's acquisitions have added more likely winners. Pfizer bought Anacor in 2016, picking up atopic dermatitis drug Eucrisa, which won FDA approval in December. Eucrisa has the potential for peak annual sales of $2 billion. Pfizer's acquisition of Medivation last year allowed it to gain Xtandi. The prostate cancer drug could generate peak annual sales of up to $5 billion, although profits must be shared with Astellas Pharma.
Pfizer's pipeline is also loaded with great candidates. Thirty-four programs are in late-stage development, with another 20 in phase 2. One especially promising late-stage pipeline candidate is avelumab, which won approval for its first indication, Merkel cell carcinoma, in March. Nine phase 3 studies are in progress targeting other cancer indications. Analysts think the drug can achieve peak annual sales of between $4 billion and $6 billion. However, Pfizer will split profits with its partner, Merck KGaA. 
Improvement from essential health
Some investors might ignore Pfizer's essential-health business segment. The business hasn't generated growth like Pfizer's innovative-health segment, which includes drugs such as Ibrance, Eucrisa, and Xtandi. The essential-health segment is stuck with legacy drugs such as Lipitor and Norvasc, which are seeing sales slide because of generic competition.
I think, though, that the essential-health segment will be key to Pfizer's future success. For one thing, the drag from the products that have lost exclusivity will diminish in the coming years. By 2020, the negative impact from these products will be minimal. 
Other areas within the essential-health segment are growing and should continue to do so. Pfizer is already marketing Inflectra, a biosimilar to Johnson & Johnson's Remicade. The company awaits approval for a biosimilar to Epogen and also has five other biosimilars in late-stage studies.
Pfizer's acquisition of Hospira in 2015 catapulted the company into a lead spot in the growing sterile injectables market. The company is also the top player in the anti-infectives market and continues to expand its presence through acquisitions.

            });
        

Dividends
Pfizer's dividend is one of the most attractive things about the stock. The dividend currently yields close to 4%, and Pfizer has steadily increased its dividend in recent years. 
Why is the dividend important for the future of Pfizer? The key thing for investors to look at with a stock is its total return -- not just the stock appreciation. Although the S&P 500 Index has outgained Pfizer in recent years, the gap is considerably smaller when dividends are included. 
I expect dividend increases to continue in the future. Pfizer's cash flow allows it to fund the dividend program at current earnings levels, but those earnings should grow faster in the coming years than they have in the past few years.
The best is yet to come
Pfizer isn't without its challenges, of course. Sales are slipping for several of its products. There's always the risk that its pipeline candidates will flop. 
However, the drugmaker appears to be in better position for success than it's been in a long time. Are the best days yet to come for Pfizer? The company's stable of potential blockbusters, improving essential-health business, and increasing dividends indicate that the future should be brighter than the past.

Q: Are there any dividend stocks that pay more than 5% that aren't too risky?
Many high-dividend stocks aren't great investments. For example, mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs) routinely pay more than 10%, but are far too volatile for most investors.
Having said that, there are some stocks that pay over 5% per year that aren't terribly risky.
One excellent place to look for high dividends is the real estate sector, specifically equity REITs, which are real estate investment trusts that own properties. These companies are not taxed at the corporate level as long as they pay at least 90% of their income to shareholders, so naturally, there are some pretty high dividends to be found.
Tanger Outlets (NYSE:SKT) is one excellent example. The outlet mall REIT pays a 5.4% dividend yield and has a fantastic track record of increasing its payout. Plus, outlet shopping is a business that operates well in any economy, which is why the company's properties have never fallen below 95% occupancy, even during the Great Recession.
Records-storage company Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) is another high-dividend REIT worth a look. The company pays a 6.2% dividend yield and enjoys the low expenses of self-storage facilities without the month-to-month lease terms.

            });
        


Outside of the real estate sector, telecom giants AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are also good options for income-seeking investors, with dividend yields of 5.2% and 5.1%, respectively. These companies produce reliable cash flow as defensive utilities, so they pay out higher-than-average dividends.
The bottom line is that safe, high-dividend stocks do exist, as long as the company's earnings justify the payouts, which is certainly the case with the four stocks discussed here.

""Do you know the only thing that gives me pleasure? It's to see my dividends coming in."" -- John D. Rockefeller
There's a reason one of the world's wealthiest men loved dividend stocks so much. Aside from the extra income, dividends, when reinvested, can grow quickly over the years thanks to the power of compounding, bringing you rich returns.
Great dividend stocks, though, go beyond high yields -- they're also stable and growing. That's why you simply can't ignore Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), and the PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (NYSEMKT:SPHD). Here's why.
Paint can color your dividend portfolio, too
The last time you got your home or workplace repainted, did you consider making money off those paint cans? You can if you invest in paint manufacturers. Specifically, you can invest in paint and coatings specialist Sherwin-Williams.
I know a dividend yield of 1% isn't really attractive, but it's hard to ignore Sherwin-Williams when you realize that it has not just paid but also increased its dividends every year since 1979, more than doubling it in the past six years or so. What matters even more is that Sherwin-Williams increased its dividend even during times of crisis like the housing bubble. There can be no greater evidence of how reliable this dividend stock is.

Image source: Getty Images

Sherwin-Williams' steady profitability and dividend streak can largely be credited to its brand power. Sherwin-Williams, Dutch Boy, and Pratt & Lambert are just some of its brands that have become household names. The company's strategy of setting up its own stores to read the consumer's pulse instead of relying on chain stores for sales has clearly paid off. Just recently, Sherwin-Williams reported 7.5% year-over-year growth in same-store paint sales for is first quarter, continuing its winning streak from fiscal 2016, when its same-store sales grew 5%.
With Sherwin-Williams upgrading its full-year earnings guidance, sitting on free cash flows worth more than $1.3 billion, and being on track to acquire Valspar to become the world's largest paints and coatings company, this is one heck of a stock no dividend lover can afford to ignore.
You won't regret owning this dividend dynamo
As boring as Illinois Tool Works' business might be, you simply can't help getting excited about the stock's dividend record and potential. Illinois Tool Works is a megaconglomerate that makes a wide range of equipment and components serving several industries, including automotive, food equipment, oil and gas, healthcare, construction, packaging, and electronics. Managing such a diverse portfolio is surely no cakewalk, but Illinois Tool Works has found strength in its 80/20 business strategy: Each of its business segments focuses on the key 20% of its customers or products that generate 80% of its sales.
This intent focus and diversity has proved to be a win-win -- Illinois Tool Works has generated steady profit and cash flow over the years. It's rewarded shareholders with annual dividend increases for more than 50 years now, with dividends growing at a compounded average clip of 14% since 2012.
Again, don't let Illinois Tool Works' small dividend yield of 1.9% deter you, because its dividends possess tremendous growth potential. And I don't say that based on just its dividend history. Illinois Tool Works recently delivered strong Q1 numbers, raised its full-year EPS guidance, and expects to convert 100% of its net profits to free cash flow this year. Considering that it ended fiscal 2016 with nearly $2 billion in FCF and paid out just about $821 million in dividends, there's a lot of legroom for higher dividends for several years to come.

Dividends from renewable energy, anyone?
NextEra's appeal as a dividend stock lies in its business structure. As a yieldco, NextEra buys and operates distressed, high-return assets and passes on a big chunk of its profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. The company has grown its dividend at an annual compounded clip of 9% since 2005.
I believe NextEra's growth potential lies in its focus on clean energy. Mind you, NextEra isn't just any other company in the clean-energy space. Together with its affiliates, NextEra is the world's largest solar and wind energy provider and is also among the largest nuclear power operators, with a total generating capacity of roughly 45,900 megawatts. Its subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, added a record 2,500 MW of wind and solar projects in 2016.
Management expects to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 6%-8% through 2020. The company has historically grown its dividends at the same rate as adjusted earnings, so that should give income investors a fair idea about what to expect going forward.

Image source: NextEra Energy's February/March presentation.

With NextEra offering a nice 2.9% yield and trading well below the industry and its own five-year average valuation at 16 times trailing earnings, it's a great time to consider this dividend growth stock.
A basket of incredible dividend stocks
We've discussed some great dividend stocks so far, but what if you could buy a basket of diversified high-yield dividend stocks at one go? Sounds like a deal, right? My next pick is just that -- the exchange-traded fund known as Invesco's PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio.
This ETF is unique in that it invests in high-yield dividend stocks that are less volatile. It does so by tracking the S&P 500 Low Volatility-High Dividend Index, which comprises the 50 ""least-volatile high-dividend-yielding"" stocks in the S&P 500, based on the standard deviation of daily prices during the trailing 252 trading days. Simply put, the highest-yielding stocks that were also the least volatile make it to the final 50. For any income investor, high yield and low volatility is a winning combination. Check the ETF's total returns versus the S&P 500 in the past three years:

SPHD Total Return Price data by YCharts
What I also like about the PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio ETF is that it gives exposure to nearly every sector, the largest being utilities, real estate, and consumer staples. Among stocks, Iron Mountain and Welltower Inc. are its two top holdings currently. With an SEC-defined yield of 3.79% and its inherent low volatility, this ETF is as good as it can get for dividend lovers.

Warren Buffett wasn't always a long-term, buy-and-hold investor. In fact, many of his earliest investments were of the activist variety, with Buffett taking large stakes and using his weight as a shareholder to demand change.
Sanborn Maps is the quintessential early Buffett investment. He snapped up the stock for as little as $45 per share, with his eyes on the company's vast investment portfolio, which was worth $65 per share. The business itself was irrelevant to his thesis -- Buffett could earn a tremendous return by simply pushing the company to liquidate its stockholdings and return the cash to shareholders. This was more or less how Buffett made money in his early years.
Eventually, Buffett became more than just a liquidator, and began investing in businesses that offered the potential to compound his wealth for years or even decades. He frequently references his purchase of See's Candies in 1972 as being the turning point, but I think the pivotal moment was when he bought American Express (NYSE:AXP) nine years earlier.
Why American Express made Buffett
American Express wasn't an average Buffett investment. He bought in a time of distress, not to liquidate the company for an immediate gain, but to benefit from its prosperity over time.
In 1963, American Express found itself on the wrong end of a very big, very bad loan to a company by the name of Allied Crude Vegetable Oil. The salad oil company faked its inventory, filling its tanks with seawater and only a modest amount of oil. Because oil is less dense than water, it would float at the top, making it appear as though the company had much more oil than it actually possessed.
Allied Crude Vegetable Oil borrowed on the basis that it had 1.8 billion pounds oil, but it only had 110 million pounds. Thus, American Express and other major banks, which took on the loan under the assumption it had ample collateral, found themselves staring down the barrel of substantial loan losses.
AmEx shares fell over 40%, as the market worried that it wouldn't survive. But Buffett was ready to buy, believing that the losses were only temporary, and that American Express's brand gave it enormous value over and beyond its accounting value.

Image source: Matt Koppenheffer.

A special situation
American Express wasn't your typical corporation. It was organized as a joint stock company, which gave its owners unlimited liability for its losses. If its balance sheet were impaired, shareholders could be called on to contribute more capital. (It converted into a typical corporate structure two years after the scandal.)
In the book The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life, author Alice Schroeder writes of the event, quoting Buffett himself:

""So every trust department in the United States panicked,"" recalls Buffett. ""I remember the Continental Bank held over 5 percent of the company, and all of a sudden not only do they see that the trust accounts were going to have stock worth zero, but they could get assessed. The stock just poured out, of course, and the market got slightly inefficient for a short period of time.""

Buffett bet big on the stock, putting 40% of his partnership's assets in American Express shares. And while he had made big bets before, this wasn't his standard fare. Previously, his large bets were concentrated in companies that could be liquidated for more than their stock-market value. This wasn't the case with AmEx, which Buffett was buying at well more than two times its book value and more than 15 times its earnings.
Up until this time, Buffett had primarily invested in companies that few would recognize, companies that would never make the front pages of a local newspaper, let alone find themselves in the middle of a national scandal. The size of his American Express investment gave Buffett a huge advantage that he never had before. Schroeder wrote that ""[n]ever before had he invested like this. Never had he put to work anything approaching this much money, and so fast, in his life.""
Having plunged as low as $35 per share, shares rapidly advanced to $70 per share, making Buffett and his investors millions in the course of just three years. The quick double from AmEx resulted in a return twice that of the S&P 500 over the period.

            });
        

Swimming naked
One of Buffett's most famous quips is that ""only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked."" On numerous occasions since the salad oil scandal, Buffett has been in the advantageous position of being the only open clothing store when others are caught with their pants down.
In the 1970s, he played a role in saving GEICO, making a fortune in the process. In the 1990s, he personally stepped in at Salomon Brothers to help it navigate a crisis. In the 2000s, he was the banker of last resort to Goldman Sachs, General Electric, USG, and Harley-Davidson. During the European debt crisis of 2011, he invested $5 billion of capital into Bank of America, injecting capital and, more importantly, confidence into the bank.
If Buffett's investment in American Express during the salad oil scandal had turned out for the worse, Buffett might have continued on as a small-cap liquidator managing a handful of money rather than the legendary investor that he is today.

The basic thesis and methods of value investing were pioneered by Columbia University professors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in the 1920s and involved analyzing metrics including the price-to-earnings ratio, book value, and dividend yield as a way to identify securities that traded below their real value. 
This approach has produced some of the most successful investors in history, and with stocks trading near record highs, taking a value-based approach stands out as a prudent way to select stocks today. Read on to learn why three top Motley Fool contributors think Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Boardwalk Pipeline Partners (NYSE:BWP), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) are value stocks that deserve the attention of astute investors.

Image source: Getty Images.

Racing down the open road
Dan Caplinger (Ford Motor): Value stocks can be tough to evaluate when they're in industries that see dramatic rises and falls in earnings over the course of a business cycle. Nowhere is that clearer than in the automotive industry, where peak earnings can lull investors into a false sense of security. That's the situation that Ford Motor finds itself in right now, sporting a trailing earnings multiple of 12 and a forward multiple of less than seven. Yet some investors think that the record sales that the industry produced in 2015 and 2016 are a thing of the past, and a future drop will crush the bottom line at Ford much more sharply.
But Ford isn't going down without a fight. Instead, it's looking at ways to secure its profits, even if it comes at the cost of revenue declines. In its most recent quarter, for instance, Ford saw 4% sales growth, but net income was down by more than a third. Going forward, though, Ford expects to invest heavily in technological advancement and updated product offerings, seeking to stay ahead of its competition and make investments that will pay off through long-term growth.
The replacement of Mark Fields with new CEO Jim Hackett should help accelerate the pace of change and improve the level of communication between the company and key stakeholders, and that will hopefully show up in the performance of the shares going forward. Even if profit levels fall somewhat, the margin of safety in Ford's stock price gives investors enough breathing room to endure short-term setbacks and remain focused on the long run.
A dirt cheap pipeline stock
Matt DiLallo (Boardwalk Pipeline Partners): Natural gas pipeline master limited partnership Boardwalk Pipeline Partners doesn't get enough credit from investors. The company generates very stable cash flow since 90% of its revenue comes from fee-based assets. It has an investment-grade credit rating, backed by an improving net debt-to-EBITDA ratio that ended last year at a solid 4.5. Furthermore, it has one of the best distribution coverage ratios in the sector at 5.0 because the company retains the bulk of its cash flow to help finance growth projects. 
However, despite that financial strength, it trades at a substantial discount to other pipeline MLPs when using the important enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio:

EPD EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YCharts.
One reason investors aren't willing to pay as much for Boardwalk Pipeline Partners is due to its below-average yield. At the moment, it pays out just 2.2% while most rivals average between 5% and 7%. That makes it an unappealing option for income-focused investors who typically hold MLPs.
However, the company is putting the finishing touches on a major expansion phase, which includes $1.3 billion of projects under development that should enter service over the next two years. As those projects start generating cash flow, Boardwalk would have a greater capacity to restart distribution growth. Once that happens, it could be all that's needed to draw back income investors, who could start bidding up the stock closer to the peer average. It's an opportunity that smart investors can take advantage of by investing in the company before others pile in.

A great dividend on the cheap
Keith Noonan (Verizon): With its dependable business, inexpensive price, and attractive returned-income component, Verizon stands out as a top stock for value-focused investors. Shares trade at roughly 12 times forward earnings estimates, a level that compares favorably to the S&P 500's forward P/E of roughly 18 and comes in below the telecommunication services industry average of 13. The company also boasts one of the best dividends in the technology sector, with a payout that yields roughly 5% and a 12-year history of annual increases. Can you hear me now?
While the communications giant is facing pressure from lower-priced alternatives from competitors including Sprint and T-Mobile and its most recent quarterly report delivered the company's first-ever drop in postpaid wireless subscriptions, Verizon is making moves to solidify its position as a premium service provider and win the next generation of wireless. It's also making moves to diversify its business.
With the recent rollout of its unlimited data plan, the company has addressed one of its main weaknesses relative to the competition, and Verizon's leading position in 5G network technologies is likely to heighten the comparative value of its wireless service going forward. Acquisitions and internal development to strengthen the company's positions in content and mobile ad delivery also have the potential to make the difference for the business over the long term.
For an industry leader with a great dividend, Verizon looks like a strong value play at current prices.

For an industry leader with a great dividend, Verizon looks like a strong value play at current prices.

",3 Value Stocks for Astute Investors
http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/05/18/3-warren-buffett-stocks-for-senior-citizens.aspx,2017-05-18,"
Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is one of the greatest investors ever, and he has talked extensively about the traits he looks for in an investment. At the same time, the portfolio he has built over the years along with investing partners Ted Weschler and Todd Combs is a great place to look for wonderful stocks. 
However, that doesn't make every stock in the Berkshire portfolio worth buying -- especially for seniors. So we asked three of our top contributors to dig into Berkshire's holdings and identify three Buffett stocks that are ideal for older investors. They came up with healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), consumer-products leader Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and payments behemoth Visa Inc. (NYSE:V).

Keep reading to learn what sets these three stocks apart, and why they're ideal investments for seniors. 
This healthcare conglomerate has everything a senior investor would want in a stock 
Sean Williams (Johnson & Johnson): Generally speaking, senior citizens prefer investments that generate above-average annual income with below-average volatility. One company that perfectly fits that definition in Buffett's portfolio is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson.
Johnson & Johnson's long-term success is derived from a number of factors, but topping the list is arguably its business structure. To begin with, it's comprised of more than 250 subsidiaries, which means it can divest and acquire assets without disrupting its core operations. It also has a tendency to go after small rather than larger acquisitions, which makes integration that much easier.

J&J has three main operating segments, each of which serves a purpose. It's most important segment is pharmaceuticals, which generates nearly half of its sales and most of its margin and growth at the moment. Medical devices has been growing slowly of late, but it provides long-tail growth opportunity for J&J as America ages. Finally, consumer products is a slow-growth division that delivers impressive pricing power and predictable cash flow. What's notable about all three divisions is they're predominantly inelastic. Since people can't control when they get sick, J&J has fairly steady business regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy is performing.
Johnson & Johnson has other factors that make it unique. For instance, it's one of just two publicly traded companies to bear the AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's. This implies that S&P has the utmost confidence that J&J can repay its debts. It's also a higher credit rating than the U.S. government!
J&J also has a streak of having increased its annual payout for 55 consecutive years, placing it among the elite of dividend aristocrats. Its current payout of 2.7% is handily above the average yield of the S&P 500 and the current national inflation rate.
Plus, as icing on the cake, it has a beta of just 0.67, implying it's only 67% as volatile as the broad-based S&P 500. It's essentially the perfect stock for seniors to consider.
Brush up on high returns
Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Colgate-Palmolive):Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a favorite metric of Buffett's because it neatly captures a company's efficiency at producing real earnings from the cash that investors have poured into the business. Colgate is one of just 10 stocks in the S&P 500 that boast ROIC of 40% or greater. Yet the consumer-products giant has trailed the broader market over the past five years amid declining sales. Net revenue was $15.2 billion last year -- down from $17.4 billion in 2013. 

Image source: Colgate-Palmolive.

Colgate's underlying business is stronger than that top-line trend suggests, though. Organic sales, which remove the negative impact of currency swings, rose a healthy 4% last year as the company tightened its grip on the global toothpaste market (Colgate owns 44% of that massive industry). Its profit margin jumped higher by almost 8 full percentage points to pass 25% of sales, and operating cash flow passed $3 billion -- easily covering the $1.3 billion of dividends it paid out. 
This dividend aristocrat recently raised its payout to mark its 54th consecutive annual boost. It has now sent a dividend to shareholders each year since 1896. Sure, Colgate will probably expand at a slower pace than its annual goal of between 4% and 7% in 2017. But the stock's weak performance lately has kept its dividend yield significantly above 2%, representing an attractive trade-off for conservative investors looking for long-term growth paired with impressive financial strength.

A huge moat can provide growth seniors need
Jason Hall (Visa): Just because you're a senior, that doesn't mean you shouldn't allocate at least part of your portfolio to long-term growth. After all, if you're over 65 today, the odds are in your favor that you'll live past 80, so you need to be sure your portfolio is still growing and healthy for years to come. Visa can help with that. 
To start, Visa (along with competitor MasterCard) is probably a lower-risk long-term investment than many would think. Unlike its bank partners that issue its cards, Visa doesn't lend money, instead making a living operating the secure, vast, reliable electronic payments network which consumers, merchants, and banks rely on. 

Image source: Visa.

In other words, Visa is very much a ""toll road"" operator, collecting a fee from every transaction on its network. And as by far the biggest operator in its space, the company benefits greatly from a network effect. Merchants want access to the hundreds of millions of Visa-paying shoppers worldwide; banks and consumers want to be on a network that's accepted at as many stores, restaurants, and businesses as possible. Even smartphone makers rely on Visa's network for mobile payment to function. This is a huge competitive advantage that investors shouldn't ignore. 
Lastly, this is a long-term growth industry, with the world's middle class on track to add billions of new members in coming decades, a trend that's set to drive huge growth in electronic payments around the world. And while Visa will be affected by the inevitable and occasional economic recession, over the long-term, its prospects -- and profits -- are set to grow. Put it all together, and these things make Visa an ideal growth stock for senior investors.  
",3 Warren Buffett Stocks for Senior Citizens
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/23/14-fascinating-facts-about-japanese-stocks-from-19.aspx,2017-05-23,"
I recently bought a secondhand copy of Martin Roth's Making Money in Japanese Stocks -- a book published in 1989, near the all-time high of the Japanese stock market.
It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities.

Image Source: Getty Images.

Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed).
As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster:

What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today.
1. One point that should not be forgotten: How thoroughly Tokyo dominated the investment landscape of the 1980s.
In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%.
In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%.
Per Roth's book, as of May 31, 1988: ""Eight Japanese corporations, five of them banks, were in the top 10"" largest companies in the world, ranked by market cap. The only American to make the list was ExxonMobil, in sixth place. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's domestic telecom giant, ""was worth more than the top eight U.S. entries  IBM, Exxon, General Electric, AT&T, Ford Motor, General Motors, Merck, and Bellsouth  combined.""  [emphasis mine]
Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence).
That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing.""
Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan.
Now think about how Americans, plowing their savings into passive S&P 500 index funds, are making an active choice that U.S. stocks are the best place for their long-term dollars. Financial advisor and Pragmatic Capitalism author Cullen Roche articulated the underlying assumptions of that strategy:

If you buy the SPY index, then you're making an active choice about 500 specific stocks. But the S&P 500 is less than 15% of the world's financial assets. It's not a comprehensive index of U.S. stocks, global stocks, and certainly not a comprehensive global financial asset portfolio. There is no practical difference between buying and holding this index of 500 chosen stocks and buying and holding 5 stocks except that your costs could end up being higher if you're paying someone a fee to pick those stocks on your behalf (your fees could actually be even lower with the 5 stocks due to no recurring fees if you choose to pick them yourself) and you're likely taking more risk with the 5-stock portfolio. But you're not ""passive"" just because you chose an index that is comprised of a certain group of specifically chosen assets that leaves you without exposure to over 85% of the world's financial assets.

This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice.
2. Japanese stocks dominated the business landscape, too.
Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3).
Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-3706');
            });
        

3. Public companies in Japan had to cope with a wild phenomenon known as Sokaiya. 
Sokaiya is a Japanese term for corporate gadflies ... who are linked to gangsters. Wikipedia says they're ""specialized racketeers unique to Japan, and often associated with the yakuza, that extort money from or blackmail companies by threatening to publicly humiliate companies and their management, usually in their annual meeting.""
Roth mentions in passing the ""the longest stockholders meeting in recent years"": a January 1984 Sony meeting, during which ""directors fielded Sokaiya interrogations for thirteen-and-a-half hours on the troubling matter of why Sony's Beta-format videocassette recorders were less popular than rival VHS-format models.""
To avoid this nuisance, public companies colluded to host their meetings on the same exact day, to make it difficult for Sokaiya to attend: ""In Japan  most corporations close their books at the end of March, and on June 29, 1988, no fewer than 1,149 of them held their annual shareholders meeting.""
4. Back in 1989, Japanese stocks were really expensive.
In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58.
Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-23247');
            });
        

5. But Japanese companies had huge numbers of cross-share holdings.
It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it.
Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade.""
Cross-share holdings still exist today, though not as deeply as back then. But on this, Japan lags. Germany, for example, had a similar concentration, which has all but evaporated. From a 2009 Automotive News Europe article:

Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies.

6. The cross-share holdings obfuscated a ""true"" P/E number back in 1989.
Consider, via Roth's book:

In March 1988 Nikkei Business magazine quoted a survey which put the true P/E of Hitachi at 60.1, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank 75.6, and Toyota Motor 25.6 The survey then factored out all shares held in cross-holdings and calculated hypothetical new P/E ratios: Hitachi 27.5, Dai-Ichi Kangyo 11.7, Toyota 3.4.





            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-9503');
            });
        

7. But the Western press wasn't buying it.
Here's Roth, quoting the Financial Times on Japanese stocks in the late 1980s: ""One cannot help feeling that successful investment in Japan requires not just a suspension of disbelief but superstitious faith, too.""
Score one for skeptical publications.
8. Some of the local media agreed...
Here's Roth citing the Far Eastern Economic Review from around the same time period:

The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason.

Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct.... Minus the behavioral elements, this sounds a bit like the algorithmic high-frequency trading driving so much of the market's minute-to-minute movements today.
9. ...But many didn't.
Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media:

The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again.

This is a critique that's been leveled at the U.S. financial press as well -- see Dean Starkman's book, The Watchdog That Didn't Bite, for instance.
10. To be fair, if you were a late 1980s observer and witnessed a 40-year run like Tokyo had had, you might feel the same...
Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise!

In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen.""
That's a 900% gain in seven years -- 39% per year.
11. Consider these individual stock returns:
All mentioned in Making Money in Japanese Stocks:

Sony: from under 700 yen in early 1966 to 5,850 yen in October 1969
Honda Motor: from 1971-73, from 130 yen to 1,120 yen
Fujitsu: from 101 yen to 795 yen in less than two years 

12. And really, what other options did a Japanese investor have for suitable returns?
In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year.""
13. Here's another way 1980s Japan sounds similar to the U.S. today.
The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today...
Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"":

The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.

Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989:

For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment.

Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world.""
Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government.
14. As similar as East and West may have seemed, here's a reminder of how different they were in 1989.

Parting thoughts
We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up.
Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore.

Financial stocks clawed back some of their significant losses from the prior session as the popular Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) tracked the broader market with a 0.4% increase. A near-1% drop in gold prices, meanwhile, sent the leveraged bullish bet on the precious metal, Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:JNUG), down almost 10%.
As for individual stocks, Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) made big moves following the companies' quarterly earnings report announcements.

Cisco's shrinking outlook
Cisco shares dropped 7% after the networking titan met expectations for its fiscal third quarter but issued weak guidance for the quarter ahead. Sales in the latest period dipped 0.5% to $11.9 billion, which was in line with management's February forecast. Non-GAAP earnings edged past targets to land at $0.60 per share.
Growth in the switching segment was more than offset by declines in the routing, collaboration, and data center divisions. Cisco's gross profit margin slipped by nearly a full percentage point, but lower expenses helped produce improved profitability as operating income rose to 32.3% of sales from 30%.

Management said it was happy with the financial results, which produced plenty of cash the company could direct toward growth areas like software and subscription services. ""We executed well in Q3,"" Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said in a press release, ""delivering 11.9 billion in total revenue, while driving solid profitability and cash generation as we deliver on our strategic priorities.""
Wall Street looked right past those solid results to focus on the company's forecast for the fourth quarter, which predicts sales declines of 6% to 4%. In a conference call with investors, Cisco explained that much of the drop is due to the move by customers toward subscription services, which is a long-term positive for the business. An apparent demand slowdown in the U.S. federal government segment is more worrisome, though, as it threatens to pinch annual results.

Wal-Mart's rising traffic
Shares of Wal-Mart gained 3% after the world's biggest retailer announced fiscal first-quarter results highlighted by encouraging sales growth. Customer traffic increased 1.5% in its U.S. locations, representing a slight acceleration from the prior quarter's pace. Wal-Mart's overall revenue improved by 1.4%, just missing consensus estimates, and earnings rose 2% to $1 per share, edging past Wall Street targets.
The company saw its biggest gains online, where gross merchandise volume spiked 69%. Wal-Mart now sells 50 million products on its website, compared to 10 million a year ago, and that competitive commitment is paying off through spiking revenue.
""We delivered a solid first quarter and we're encouraged by the start of the year,"" CEO Doug McMillon said in a press release. ""We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers,"" he added.
Thanks to improving traffic trends in both its physical and e-commerce properties, Wal-Mart believes its momentum is speeding up. For the quarter ahead, executives forecast a slight acceleration in growth as comps rise by between 1.5% and 2% at U.S. locations. At the same time, gross profit margin should hold steady, especially since the company is entering the quarter with a lean inventory position.
",What Happened in the Stock Market Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/27/is-management-really-to-blame-for-ibms-woes.aspx,2017-05-27,"
Back in March, I discussed five reasons that IBM (NYSE:IBM) could benefit from a change in management. I noted that its revenue declines wouldn't end anytime soon, that the growth of its key ""strategic imperatives"" was slowing down, that it remained an underdog in the cloud race, that it was too dependent on outsourcing, and that it wasn't being upfront about its layoffs.
While those are still valid points, we should acknowledge that Ginni Rometty was dealt a tough hand when she became the company's ninth CEO in 2012. So today, we'll examine some of Rometty's biggest moves, and whether or not they actually moved IBM in the right direction. 

IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. Image source: IBM.

Paying for Palmisano's mistakes
Former CEO Sam Palmisano -- who led IBM from 2002 to 2011 -- arguably set the company on the wrong path in 2010, when he boldly promised to double its annual earnings per share from $10.01 in 2009 to $20 by 2015. That proclamation was so impressive that Warren Buffett, who famously avoided tech stocks, made it one of Berkshire Hathaway's top holdings.
The problem was that Palmisano's ""Roadmap 2015"" plan mainly consisted of selling big business units (like its PC business, which it sold to Lenovo in 2004), aggressively cutting costs, and repurchasing stock. That conservative strategy boosted IBM's earnings but caused it to fall behind the tech curve as rival companies -- like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google -- invested heavily in cloud-based platforms.
Abandoning Roadmap 2015
When Rometty took over, she initially followed Palmisano's playbook by cutting costs, laying off employees, and dumping lower-margin business units. The company even paid GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to take over its money-losing chipmaking business, and its debt levels surged as it funded more buybacks with debt. 
But in late 2014, Rometty wisely abandoned Palmisano's $20 per share target. This decision finally gave Rometty the freedom to pursue more acquisitions in the higher-growth cloud and mobility markets.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-68278');
            });
        

Laying down the foundations of its ""strategic imperatives""
Even before she scrapped Roadmap 2015, Rometty realized that IBM had fallen far behind Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in public cloud platforms -- which lend out storage space, computing power, and development tools to companies and developers. 
That's why Rometty had IBM acquire cloud infrastructure giant SoftLayer Technologies for $2 billion in 2013. She followed that purchase with dozens of other takeovers of businesses in the cloud, analytics, mobility, security, and social industries -- the five pillars of growth which became IBM's ""strategic imperatives"". 
Revenue from those businesses rose 12% annually last quarter and accounted for 42% of IBM's top line over the past 12 months. Without Rometty's guidance, this new category of higher-growth businesses might not even exist.
Investing in next-gen technologies
Rometty also created dedicated business units for next-gen technologies. In 2014, IBM created a new unit for its AI platform Watson, which may help it counter similar AI efforts at Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Google's Cloud Machine Learning Service. 
The following year, IBM launched dedicated units for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Education markets -- which expanded its big data and analytics reach into both industries. It also launched Watson Health, a dedicated unit for gathering and analyzing healthcare records from millions of devices. The company is also currently expanding its presence in the cybersecurity, quantum computing, and blockchain markets -- which could widen its moat against its biggest rivals.

            });
        

Halting the buybacks
After abandoning Palmisano's plan, Rometty finally weaned IBM off its addiction to debt-fueled buybacks, as seen in the following chart:

Source: YCharts
This bold move caused IBM's annual earnings to drop 10% in 2015 and 9% in 2016, but those declines were arguably necessary to allow the pursuit of other investments and acquisitions. Looking ahead, analysts expect IBM's cost-cutting plans, stabilizing (albeit stagnant) revenues, and investments in higher-margin businesses to lift its earnings by 1% this year and 2% next year. 
So should investors blame the management?
Shares of IBM have declined 8% this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 8%. The reasons are easy to see -- the company's revenue has fallen annually for 20 straight quarters, Warren Buffett sold about 30% of Berkshire's stake in February, and Moody's downgraded its credit rating in early May.
Amid all those negative headlines, it's easy to blame IBM's management for its current woes. However, it makes more sense to blame former CEO Sam Palmisano for most of those problems. Rometty initially waited too long to abandon Palmisano's quixotic plan, but her moves over the past three years indicate that she knows how to turn around the aging company. Therefore, investors should keep those facts in mind before assuming that IBM would fare better under new management.

That conservative strategy boosted IBM's earnings but caused it to fall behind the tech curve as rival companies -- like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google -- invested heavily in cloud-based platforms.
Abandoning Roadmap 2015
When Rometty took over, she initially followed Palmisano's playbook by cutting costs, laying off employees, and dumping lower-margin business units. The company even paid GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to take over its money-losing chipmaking business, and its debt levels surged as it funded more buybacks with debt. 
But in late 2014, Rometty wisely abandoned Palmisano's $20 per share target. This decision finally gave Rometty the freedom to pursue more acquisitions in the higher-growth cloud and mobility markets.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-92949');
            });
        

Laying down the foundations of its ""strategic imperatives""
Even before she scrapped Roadmap 2015, Rometty realized that IBM had fallen far behind Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in public cloud platforms -- which lend out storage space, computing power, and development tools to companies and developers. 
That's why Rometty had IBM acquire cloud infrastructure giant SoftLayer Technologies for $2 billion in 2013. She followed that purchase with dozens of other takeovers of businesses in the cloud, analytics, mobility, security, and social industries -- the five pillars of growth which became IBM's ""strategic imperatives"". 
Revenue from those businesses rose 12% annually last quarter and accounted for 42% of IBM's top line over the past 12 months. Without Rometty's guidance, this new category of higher-growth businesses might not even exist.
Investing in next-gen technologies
Rometty also created dedicated business units for next-gen technologies. In 2014, IBM created a new unit for its AI platform Watson, which may help it counter similar AI efforts at Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Google's Cloud Machine Learning Service. 
The following year, IBM launched dedicated units for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Education markets -- which expanded its big data and analytics reach into both industries. It also launched Watson Health, a dedicated unit for gathering and analyzing healthcare records from millions of devices. The company is also currently expanding its presence in the cybersecurity, quantum computing, and blockchain markets -- which could widen its moat against its biggest rivals.

Halting the buybacks
After abandoning Palmisano's plan, Rometty finally weaned IBM off its addiction to debt-fueled buybacks, as seen in the following chart:

Source: YCharts
This bold move caused IBM's annual earnings to drop 10% in 2015 and 9% in 2016, but those declines were arguably necessary to allow the pursuit of other investments and acquisitions. Looking ahead, analysts expect IBM's cost-cutting plans, stabilizing (albeit stagnant) revenues, and investments in higher-margin businesses to lift its earnings by 1% this year and 2% next year. 
So should investors blame the management?
Shares of IBM have declined 8% this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 8%. The reasons are easy to see -- the company's revenue has fallen annually for 20 straight quarters, Warren Buffett sold about 30% of Berkshire's stake in February, and Moody's downgraded its credit rating in early May.
Amid all those negative headlines, it's easy to blame IBM's management for its current woes. However, it makes more sense to blame former CEO Sam Palmisano for most of those problems. Rometty initially waited too long to abandon Palmisano's quixotic plan, but her moves over the past three years indicate that she knows how to turn around the aging company. Therefore, investors should keep those facts in mind before assuming that IBM would fare better under new management.

Warren Buffett wasn't always a long-term, buy-and-hold investor. In fact, many of his earliest investments were of the activist variety, with Buffett taking large stakes and using his weight as a shareholder to demand change.
Sanborn Maps is the quintessential early Buffett investment. He snapped up the stock for as little as $45 per share, with his eyes on the company's vast investment portfolio, which was worth $65 per share. The business itself was irrelevant to his thesis -- Buffett could earn a tremendous return by simply pushing the company to liquidate its stockholdings and return the cash to shareholders. This was more or less how Buffett made money in his early years.
Eventually, Buffett became more than just a liquidator, and began investing in businesses that offered the potential to compound his wealth for years or even decades. He frequently references his purchase of See's Candies in 1972 as being the turning point, but I think the pivotal moment was when he bought American Express (NYSE:AXP) nine years earlier.
Why American Express made Buffett
American Express wasn't an average Buffett investment. He bought in a time of distress, not to liquidate the company for an immediate gain, but to benefit from its prosperity over time.
In 1963, American Express found itself on the wrong end of a very big, very bad loan to a company by the name of Allied Crude Vegetable Oil. The salad oil company faked its inventory, filling its tanks with seawater and only a modest amount of oil. Because oil is less dense than water, it would float at the top, making it appear as though the company had much more oil than it actually possessed.
Allied Crude Vegetable Oil borrowed on the basis that it had 1.8 billion pounds oil, but it only had 110 million pounds. Thus, American Express and other major banks, which took on the loan under the assumption it had ample collateral, found themselves staring down the barrel of substantial loan losses.
AmEx shares fell over 40%, as the market worried that it wouldn't survive. But Buffett was ready to buy, believing that the losses were only temporary, and that American Express's brand gave it enormous value over and beyond its accounting value.

A special situation
American Express wasn't your typical corporation. It was organized as a joint stock company, which gave its owners unlimited liability for its losses. If its balance sheet were impaired, shareholders could be called on to contribute more capital. (It converted into a typical corporate structure two years after the scandal.)
In the book The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life, author Alice Schroeder writes of the event, quoting Buffett himself:

""So every trust department in the United States panicked,"" recalls Buffett. ""I remember the Continental Bank held over 5 percent of the company, and all of a sudden not only do they see that the trust accounts were going to have stock worth zero, but they could get assessed. The stock just poured out, of course, and the market got slightly inefficient for a short period of time.""

Buffett bet big on the stock, putting 40% of his partnership's assets in American Express shares. And while he had made big bets before, this wasn't his standard fare. Previously, his large bets were concentrated in companies that could be liquidated for more than their stock-market value. This wasn't the case with AmEx, which Buffett was buying at well more than two times its book value and more than 15 times its earnings.
Up until this time, Buffett had primarily invested in companies that few would recognize, companies that would never make the front pages of a local newspaper, let alone find themselves in the middle of a national scandal. The size of his American Express investment gave Buffett a huge advantage that he never had before. Schroeder wrote that ""[n]ever before had he invested like this. Never had he put to work anything approaching this much money, and so fast, in his life.""
Having plunged as low as $35 per share, shares rapidly advanced to $70 per share, making Buffett and his investors millions in the course of just three years. The quick double from AmEx resulted in a return twice that of the S&P 500 over the period.

            });
        

Swimming naked
One of Buffett's most famous quips is that ""only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked."" On numerous occasions since the salad oil scandal, Buffett has been in the advantageous position of being the only open clothing store when others are caught with their pants down.
In the 1970s, he played a role in saving GEICO, making a fortune in the process. In the 1990s, he personally stepped in at Salomon Brothers to help it navigate a crisis. In the 2000s, he was the banker of last resort to Goldman Sachs, General Electric, USG, and Harley-Davidson. During the European debt crisis of 2011, he invested $5 billion of capital into Bank of America, injecting capital and, more importantly, confidence into the bank.
If Buffett's investment in American Express during the salad oil scandal had turned out for the worse, Buffett might have continued on as a small-cap liquidator managing a handful of money rather than the legendary investor that he is today. 
",1 Stock That Was Pivotal in Billionaire Warren Buffett's Career
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/27/why-enbridge-inc-is-a-dividend-investors-dream.aspx,2017-05-27,"
If I were to lay out my criteria for a dream dividend stock, it would have the following five characteristics:

A history of paying an eye-catching dividend.
The company supports the payout with relatively stable cash flow.
Comfortably covers the dividend by generating substantial excess cash.
It has an investment-grade credit rating with improving metrics.
Finally, it has a clearly visible growth plan that should take the payout higher in the future.

While I know that's asking a lot, the good news is that several stocks do fit those criteria. One company that certainly fits the bill is Enbridge (NYSE:ENB), which has the potential to be an outstanding income stock for long-term investors.

Image source: Getty Images.

An impressive past and present
Enbridge has long been an excellent income stock, paying a dividend to investors for the past 64 years. Furthermore, it has increased that payout in each of the past 22 years and by an average compound annual rate of 11.2%. The only downside is that because it's a Canadian company, it pays dividends in Canadian dollars, which means that the quarterly rate for American investors can fluctuate a bit with exchange rates. However, even with that minor variation, the stock is still worth considering because at the current combination of the exchange rate and market price Enbridge yields 4.2%, which is more than twice what the average stock in the S&P 500 yields. 
Rock-solid cash flow
One of the reasons Enbridge has been able to pay a generously growing dividend is due to the security of its cash flow. Currently, 96% of its earnings come from stable and predictable take-or-pay and equivalent contracts as well as regulated assets. That's one of the highest percentages in the energy infrastructure sector, with rivals Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) and TransCanada (NYSE:TRP), for example, at 91% and 95%, respectively. TransCanada was only at 92% last year but has caught up by acquiring additional fee-based assets and jettisoning those with less stable cash flow. 




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-61483');
            });
        

Plenty of room to spare
Not only does Enbridge generate very stable cash flow, but it only plans to pay out 50% to 60% of it in dividends each year, retaining the rest to help finance expansion projects. While that's a bit higher than TransCanada's roughly 40% payout ratio and Kinder Morgan's current 25% ratio, it's still very conservative in the energy infrastructure sector, as most companies pay out more than 80% of their cash flow. Meanwhile, the only reason Kinder Morgan's payout ratio is so low at the moment is that the company slashed its dividend 75% a few years ago to ease concerns about its growing leverage.

Image source: Getty Images.

Giving credit where credit is due
Enbridge, like both TransCanada and Kinder Morgan, has an investment-grade credit rating. What's interesting is that its credit rating is higher than Kinder Morgan's despite ending last year with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.2, which is on the high side considering that Kinder Morgan's credit concerns heightened as its leverage crept toward 6.0 times. That said, with a higher percentage of cash flow coming from stable fees and a lower dividend payout ratio, Enbridge can handle that higher leverage. Furthermore, the reason Enbridge has an elevated debt level at the moment is that it's in the midst of a major expansion phase. Once those projects enter service, the incremental earnings will bring the leverage ratio down, with the company expecting to end this year at 5.5 times, which is just above the 5.4 times leverage ratio that Kinder Morgan expects to have at the end of this year. Meanwhile, Enbridge sees that number hitting 4.3 times by 2019 once the rest of its current slate of expansion projects start generating earnings, which is well below its 5.0 times target.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-41583');
            });
        

A pipeline of growth opportunities
Those growth projects will not only deliver a significant improvement to Enbridge's leverage, but they'll provide the company with substantial annual cash flows. Under the company's expectations, available cash flow from operations will increase by 12% to 14% per year through 2019 as a result of the projects it currently has under development. Meanwhile, with the largest backlog of growth projects in the industry, Enbridge believes it can grow its dividend by 10% to 12% annually all the way through 2024. That's by far the best growth forecast in the sector since, for example, TransCanada only expects to grow its dividend by 8% to 10% per year through 2020, while Kinder Morgan has yet to restart dividend growth.
Investor takeaway
Enbridge checks all the boxes for what an investor could want in an income stock. It pays a generous, well-supported dividend that will likely grow at a healthy rate for years to come. That combination of characteristics makes it a dream stock for income-seeking investors.

Mutual funds are an easy way for beginning investors to put their money to work in the markets. But before you invest in mutual funds, it's important to know what to watch out for. With index funds that are passively managed and tend to have low expense ratios and actively managed funds that promise the potential to outperform but typically at a higher cost, you need to know what you're buying before you invest. Following these steps can give you a better sense of how to be smart with mutual fund investing.
Step 1: Decide whether you want to go active or passive
The biggest decision you'll need to make as a mutual fund investor is whether you think active management is worth the extra price you'll pay. Unfortunately, a large majority of actively managed mutual funds end up underperforming the major stock market benchmarks, making it counterproductive to spend more money to invest in them. However, a handful of fund managers have been able to demonstrate sustained outperformance over the long run. If you're confident that those track records are legitimate -- and that they'll continue -- then it can make sense to invest at least some of your money actively in order to try to capture the prowess of superior fund managers.

Step 2: Minimize fees
Regardless of which type of mutual fund you end up choosing, it always pays to economize on costs. First and foremost, make sure that you don't pay an up-front sales load on a mutual fund purchase, as doing so simply diverts a percentage of your initial investment into your broker's wallet. Equally important but often overlooked is the impact of high annual expenses. Paying more than 1% for an active fund makes it very difficult for a fund even to match the performance of its benchmark, let alone surpass it on a consistent basis. With index funds offering expense ratios of less than 0.1%, you don't have to pay a lot for mutual funds.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-75796');
            });
        

Step 3: Pick a diversified portfolio of funds
In buying mutual funds, it's important to look beyond the mere number of funds you own and make sure that those funds actually own different investments. If you have five mutual funds but they're all index-tracking funds that follow the S&P 500, then you actually have no more diversification than you'd have owning a single fund. Instead, look to buy mutual funds with different investments, such as stocks, bonds, real estate investments, and other alternatives. Within categories, look for other ways to diversify, such as with a foreign stock fund to go with a U.S. stock fund. That way, you'll have a balanced portfolio that can thrive under a wider range of market conditions.
Step 4: Find a family
With mutual funds, the cheapest way to set up accounts is directly with the fund company that offers shares. Therefore, if you can find a company that offers a family of funds that you like, then it makes things a lot easier, because you can make a single deposit that gets divided into different funds on a regular basis. That's not to say that you have to stick with one family, and many investors feel more comfortable diversifying by fund provider. However, those who do find certain fund families that give them the exposure they want find that their tracking is easier than it is with multiple fund families to deal with over time.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-3116');
            });
        

Step 5: Don't stop watching
Finally, even once you've selected and invested in a mutual fund, your job's not over. You also need to monitor your mutual funds to make sure that everything continues to run smoothly. If there's a change in investment management, you'll want to watch closely to see if the new manager continues to do things as well as the old manager did, especially for actively managed funds. With index funds, a change to a new benchmark index could signal a shift in the performance of the fund, and you'll have to decide whether that's consistent with your investment strategy going forward. Most importantly, a rise in fees can signal a change in fund philosophy that you won't like.
Mutual funds are a great way to invest without a huge amount of effort. By following these steps with your mutual fund investments, you can make sure that you'll get the most out of your funds as you can.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/18/heres-why-the-dows-373-point-plunge-is-laughable.aspx,2017-05-18,"
Panic has hit Wall Street, or so the headlines would make it appear.
Yesterday, May 17, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) ""plunged"" 373 points and wiped out more than three weeks' worth of progress in the index. It was the biggest move lower that Wall Street had seen in the Dow in quite some time.

Image source: Getty Images.

The reason for the move lower appears to be worries over President Trump and his ability to lead the nation. In particular, The New York Times reports that former FBI Director James Comey put together a memo outlining President Trump's request to drop his investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn. Since the stock market very much dislikes uncertainty, rumors of possible wrongdoing from the President has investors unnerved.
Here's just a sampling of what investors saw in yesterday's news headlines:

Dow Plunges 350 as Trump Worries Rattle Wall Street -- NBC Boston
Look Out! Dow Drops 250 Points; VIX Spikes 28% -- Barron's
Banks Battered As Dow Crashes Through Key Technical Support -- ZeroHedge
Wall Street Tumbles As Investors Flee Latest Trump Crisis -- Reuters

You'd think it was utter chaos and an absolute bloodbath on Wall Street based on these sensationalist headlines. Yet, in spite of what turned out to be the Dow's biggest move in eight months, the 373-point ""plunge"" in the Dow worked out to a decline of (*drumroll*)... a pedestrian 1.77%.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-28249');
            });
        


Cue the laughter.
Everything is relative 
Throughout its storied history, I'd be willing to bet that the Dow has seen hundreds, if not thousands, of days where it moved up or down around 2%. What's changed over time is that the Dow's intrinsic value has increased. In other words, the Dow has gone from less than 2,000 points to more than 21,000 points in just 30 years. Unfortunately, investors haven't adjusted how they view the Dow's daily moves in percentage terms despite the underlying growth in the valuation of its 30 components over the years. What we're left with is sensationalist headlines and fear seemingly every time the Dow moves 200 or 300 points lower when, in reality, it's nothing more than a pedestrian and forgettable move, based on its history.

Data source: Wikipedia, The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones. Table by author.

For example, just to register among the Dow's 20 largest daily point losses of all-time, the Dow would need to drop about 470 points. Today, that works out to a drop of about 2.2%. Again, that would be a very pedestrian single-day move in percentage terms, but the news outlets would lead you to believe the Dow ""plunged.""
In order for the Dow to really ""plunge"" (and to be fair, there is no concrete definition of what qualifies as a plunge, meaning I'm being arbitrary) it would have to register a 7% move lower to break into the 20 largest daily percentage losses of all-time. In other words, we'd need to see a drop of almost 1,470 points in a single day based on the closing value of the Dow on May 16 just to rank 20th all-time in terms of percentage drops. Yesterday's move lower on Trump worries wasn't even in the ballpark of cracking the top 20 largest percentage declines in the Dow.

History suggests you're smart to buy high-quality companies when they drop
So, what should you do, if anything, given that the Dow ""plunged"" 373 points yesterday? History suggests that buying high-quality stocks that dropped in value probably isn't a bad idea.
Last year, J.P. Morgan Asset Management put out a report, ""Staying Invested During Volatile Markets,"" which looked at the performance of long-term investments in the broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) between Jan. 3, 1995 and Dec. 31, 2014. What the analysis showed was that investors who held throughout the full 20-year period earned 555%, or 9.9% per year. Mind you, this includes investors having held throughout the dot-com bubble and the Great Recession. Both events led to a peak decline in the S&P 500 of 50% and 57%, respectively.

Image source: Getty Images.

Conversely, missing just the 10 best days the S&P 500 had over a more than 5,000-day period would have more than halved investors' returns. Since no one can effectively ""time the market"" over the long-run, the lesson is that investors should stay the course in high-quality stocks since they tend to increase in value over time.  
It's also never a bad idea to consider revisiting the investment thesis for every stock you own, albeit you don't have to wait for a perceived ""plunge"" to do so. Your investment thesis describes your reasoning for buying into a company in the first place. If that reasoning hasn't changed (and chances are a sizable point drop in the Dow isn't going to change your investment thesis), then there's no reason to panic and sell your stock(s).

            });
        


If you approach investing with a long-term mindset (which history shows is your best path to generate healthy returns), you'll not only sleep better and earn more, but you'll get a good chuckle at sensationalist headlines in the process.

The S&P 500 is currently hovering near a record high, but the index has remained almost flat since the beginning of May. That stagnation has been attributed to uncertainties about the Trump Administration's policies, the anticipation of interest rate hikes later this year, and historically high valuations for the overall market. 
But as the U.S. market remains stuck in neutral, Chinese tech stocks have thrived, sparked by impressive growth figures and their detachment from U.S.-centered issues. Let's examine three stocks in that industry which have already rallied more than 30% this month -- Baozun (NASDAQ:BZUN), Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), and SINA (NASDAQ:SINA).

Baozun
Baozun is a Chinese e-commerce company that provides IT services, digital storefronts for online marketplaces, marketing campaigns, customer service, and fulfillment services for its customers. Like Shopify, it's basically a ""one-stop shop"" for businesses that need to quickly establish an e-commerce presence.
Shares of Baozun have rallied 30% since the beginning of May. The stock rose ahead of its first quarter report on May 16, dipped briefly after Baozun beat revenue estimates but only matched earnings expectations, but rebounded as healthy growth figures from e-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Weibo revived investor interest in Chinese tech stocks. 
The main threat to Baozun is that big online marketplaces like JD.com and Alibaba's Tmall could launch similar platforms and cut Baozun out of the loop. But in the U.S., Amazon fully partnered with Shopify instead of competing against it -- so it's possible that JD.com and Alibaba will do the same. 
Analysts expect Baozun's revenue and earnings to respectively grow 25% and 121% this year as more businesses try to reach China's growing internet population. Its P/E ratio of 89 looks high relative to its industry average of 43, but it can be justified by its earnings growth rate.
Weibo and SINA
Back in 2014, Chinese online media giant SINA spun off Weibo, its microblogging site, as a separate publicly traded company. SINA retained a majority stake in Weibo, and Alibaba became the new company's second largest investor.

As a result, these three tech giants' ecosystems are deeply intertwined. For example, Weibo users can directly access headlines from SINA's news portal and make e-commerce purchases and payments with Alibaba's Alipay platform. This alliance is considered a defensive measure against Tencent's (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY) popular messaging app WeChat, which has expanded over the past few years into a monolithic app for games, mobile payments, and online-to-offline services like hailing cabs and ordering food. 
Weibo and SINA both crushed analyst expectations in their most recent quarters. Weibo's revenue and non-GAAP earnings respectively surged 67% and 254%, fueled by a 71% jump in ad revenues and 30% growth in monthly active users to 340 million -- which gives it a larger overall audience than Twitter. Analysts expect Weibo's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 57% and 79% this year. 
SINA's revenue, heavily boosted by its stake in Weibo, rose 40% annually last quarter. Its non-GAAP earnings of $0.50 per share also marked a big improvement from its loss of $0.04 per share in the prior year quarter. Analysts expect SINA's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 39% and 81% this year.
 Those massive growth figures explain why Weibo and SINA respectively rallied 46% and 36% since the beginning of May. However, Weibo's P/E of 119 is much higher than its industry average of 37 and its projected earnings growth rate -- so it could be vulnerable to a big sell-off. By comparison, SINA's P/E of 32 looks much cheaper.

Chinese tech stocks can be very volatile, so they definitely aren't for queasy investors. Their high valuations also indicate that they could easily be cut in half during a major market downturn. Investors should also be aware that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could cause big declines in ad spending. 
Regulators could also throttle spending on ads and e-commerce platform with new regulations or by cracking down on controversial live streaming platforms, which have become a gold mine for companies like Weibo.

",3 Chinese Stocks That Rallied Over 30% in May
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/23/3-chinese-stocks-that-rallied-over-30-in-may.aspx,2017-05-23,"
The S&P 500 is currently hovering near a record high, but the index has remained almost flat since the beginning of May. That stagnation has been attributed to uncertainties about the Trump Administration's policies, the anticipation of interest rate hikes later this year, and historically high valuations for the overall market. 
But as the U.S. market remains stuck in neutral, Chinese tech stocks have thrived, sparked by impressive growth figures and their detachment from U.S.-centered issues. Let's examine three stocks in that industry which have already rallied more than 30% this month -- Baozun (NASDAQ:BZUN), Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), and SINA (NASDAQ:SINA).

Baozun
Baozun is a Chinese e-commerce company that provides IT services, digital storefronts for online marketplaces, marketing campaigns, customer service, and fulfillment services for its customers. Like Shopify, it's basically a ""one-stop shop"" for businesses that need to quickly establish an e-commerce presence.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/23/centurylink-has-a-friendly-activist-what-it-means.aspx,2017-05-23,"
Suffering shareholders of the telecoms company CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) got a boost on May 8 when activist investor Keith Meister revealed a 5.5% stake in the company, calling the shares undervalued by at least 40% and offering some ""friendly"" advice on management succession as the company merges with Level 3 Communications (NYSE:LVLT).
As both I and fellow Fool Steve Symington have written before, CenturyLink's merger with Level 3 is a smart idea. The merger could turn CenturyLink from a struggling business -- that may have to cut its 9% dividend -- into a thriving one with plenty of dividend coverage and growth prospects. The key, though, is that the merger actually goes through, and that integration is successful. Meister shares this view, with a few other insights as well.
Start Tom Brady
Keith Meister is an activist and is known for taking on management teams. His take on CenturyLink is not the typical activist move of fixing a bad business. Rather, Meister merely suggests that Level 3's CEO, Jeff Storey, remain an executive to help oversee the integration. The succession plan as of now is for Story to join the board of the combined companies, but not in an executive role. Meister doesn't think CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post is a bad executive. Rather, he wishes to see both in hands-on roles at the combined company. 

Image source: Getty Images.

This is because Storey has had a great track record at Level 3. Meister notes that since Story became CEO in 2013, Level 3 stock has risen 175%, beating the S&P 500 by a whopping 125%. ""If you're the New England Patriots,"" Meister said, ""you are going to start Tom Brady."" 
I hope Meister is aware that Storey may be taking a step back due to a heart condition that sidelined him in February of 2016; however, assuming Storey's health is OK, I'd agree with Meister. Level 3's recent record has been much better than CenturyLink's. 
Why Meister believes it's mispriced
Meister has a few theories as to why the stock is mispriced. Mostly, CenturyLink's recent earnings were bad, showing an increased deterioration of its legacy businesses, even as its new businesses such as high-bandwidth enterprise services showed growth.  Mr. Market, Meister contends, does not have the imagination to picture how much better the merged company will be. Since the deal announcement, CenturyLink's stock is down 10%-25% from where it was prior, despite the merger making the stock a better bet. That doesn't make much sense to Meister. 
Moreover, Meister believes people are mistakenly comparing CenturyLink to Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR), which just cut its dividend 62%, and which some investors believe is going bankrupt. 
However, Meister notes that Frontier is regional, which puts it at a scale disadvantage to CenturyLink and other competitors. Moreover, it is dealing with a poor integration of Verizon's wireline businesses in California, Texas, and Florida. Finally, the company only has 42% of its customers as Enterprise, which Meister believes are much ""stickier"" customers than consumers. Post-merger, CenturyLink and Level 3 will have 76% enterprise exposure, which Meister believes is a much higher-quality earnings stream.

Meister knows telecom
Meister has had a good history with telecom stock picks. His firm, Corvex Capital, had success with telecom investments in ABVT, which was later acquired by Zayo (NYSE:ZAYO), and TW Telecom, which was acquired by Level 3 back in 2014. Meister now believes the Level 3 and CenturyLink merger will yield another win for his fund.
Given Meister's seal of approval, as well as Steve's and my own optimism regarding the deal, I think he may be onto something. The trick, of course, is obviously for the deal to go through, and then for the integration to go well. Those are always risks, especially with a merger of two $30 billion companies that will carry significant debt post-merger.
Bottom line: CenturyLink's stock took a hit after earnings, but a big hedge fund manager shining the light on the potential opportunities of its merger with Level 3 is giving shareholders hope for better times ahead.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/25/bullish-on-nvidia-youll-love-these-stocks.aspx,2017-05-25,"
Shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) have rallied more than 210% over the past 12 months, fueled by robust demand for its gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and CPUs for connected cars. But after that huge run, NVIDIA now trades at 53 times earnings -- more than double the industry average of 26 for semiconductor makers.
Therefore, investors might hesitate to buy NVIDIA at these levels, especially with the market hovering near historic highs. So for investors who like NVIDIA's growth story but don't like its premium valuation, here are two alternative plays to consider -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).

AMD
AMD is NVIDIA's main rival in discrete GPUs. According to research firm JPR, AMD controlled 29.5% of the market at the end of 2016, compared to NVIDIA's 70.5% share. AMD generally sells cheaper GPUs than NVIDIA, which helped it carve out a loyal niche among budget PC gamers. 
AMD has been aggressively striking back at NVIDIA in GPUs and Intel in CPUs with new products. On the GPU front, it launched new low-end VR-ready GPUs with its Polaris chipset to challenge NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal cards last year. It also plans to launch a preemptive strike against NVIDIA's next-gen Volta cards with its Vega-based cards later this year. 

AMD's RX480 GPU. Image source: AMD.

In CPUs, AMD is challenging Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors with its new Ryzen chips -- which reportedly offer comparable performance as Intel's top-tier eight-core chips at about half the price. These fresh catalysts could significantly strengthen its computing and graphics business over the next few quarters. 
AMD also dominates modern gaming consoles by supplying custom SoCs for the PS4 and Xbox One, which have since become a pillar of growth for its EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) unit.
Analysts expect these tailwinds to lift AMD's revenue by 13% this year, while its non-GAAP earnings -- which have remained in the red for two straight years -- are expected to bounce back into the black. AMD has rallied 180% over the past 12 months on that optimism, but it still isn't that expensive at 2.1 times sales, which is much lower than the industry average price-to-sales ratio of 4 for semiconductor makers.
Qualcomm
Qualcomm's 8% gain over the past 12 months looks paltry relative to NVIDIA's and AMD's gains, but that's because the mobile chipmaker has been weighed down by a series of ongoing legal battles with regulators and smartphone makers.

Image source: Qualcomm.

Since those battles are mainly centered on the mobile device market, Qualcomm is aggressively expanding into adjacent markets -- like wearables, connected cameras, drones, and connected cars -- to diversify its business. A big part of that push is challenging NVIDIA's rapidly growing business of connected cars.
Last year, Qualcomm launched Snapdragon Automotive chips to counter the growing adoption of NVIDIA's Tegra chips in infotainment and navigation systems in connected cars. Qualcomm will also close its $47 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world, later this year. 
That purchase will give Qualcomm NXP's BlueBox platform for driverless cars, which directly competes against NVIDIA's Drive PX platform. Since NXP sells a large variety of other automotive chips, Qualcomm will likely employ bundling strategies to gain market share against NVIDIA in the automotive market, which might make the former a better long-term play on connected cars than the latter.
Qualcomm's legal troubles won't end anytime soon, but the NXP deal could transform its business model into a more balanced one, instead of one that relies heavily on a high-margin licensing business propping up a lower-margin one that makes mobile chipsets. 
Analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and earnings (excluding the NXP deal) to dip 3% and 4%, respectively, this year. That sounds dismal, but the stock's price to earnings of 20 remains lower than the industry average of 26 for semiconductor makers, and its forward dividend yield of 3.9% is much higher than S&P 500's current yield of 2%.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-72591');
            });
        

The key takeaways
I doubt NVIDIA will lose its footing anytime soon, thanks to its market-leading positions in GPUs and automotive CPUs. However, the stock could certainly stagnate as investors fret over its valuations. 
So, in the meantime, investors should keep AMD and Qualcomm in mind as alternative plays on GPUs and connected cars. There's no guarantee that either stock will outperform NVIDIA this year, but they could be lifted by the same rising tides that are boosting NVIDIA's growth.

With the market at an all-time high, eight full years into what's been one of the longest bull markets in history, having a few value stocks in one's portfolio might just be more important than ever -- particularly for retirees. More specifically, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM), Philips 66 (NYSE:PSX), and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) appear to be interesting choices.
Three of our Fools break down the details on these great picks to get retirees -- or any investor digging for value in today's sky-high stock market -- started today.

Turning agricultural products into gold
Sean O'Reilly (Archer Daniels Midland): My pick for the ideal value stock as part of a retirement portfolio, Archer Daniels Midland, has a great deal to offer any Foolish investor. It boasts a forward P/E ratio of just 15, and earnings per share are expected to grow to $3.37 on average by fiscal 2020, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company is a bastion of value in a world where the forward P/E ratio of the S&P 500 index is 24.
Founded in 1898 as a milling company in Minneapolis, Archer Daniels Midland is an agricultural-products powerhouse. Today, it's a modern commodity operator, offering everything from oilseeds, corn, and rice for food manufacturing to ingredients for animal feed and cotton pulp for paper manufacturing. The company made a big move with its $3 billion acquisition of German natural-ingredients company Wild Flavors in 2014, pushing itself further into the increasingly important business of natural flavors, proteins, and health products.
The company is a prime example of sound financial management and execution. It generated $957 million of free cash flow in the 12 months ended March 31, up significantly from $593 million in fiscal 2016. In the company's Q1 earnings press release, CEO Juan Luciano touched on the reason for the improvement:

We are continuing to execute the long-term strategic plan that we launched in 2012, and we are seeing the results. We have strengthened our core, improving our cost positions and implementing measures to improve results where necessary. Our operational-excellence initiatives have delivered significant savings and efficiencies. And we continue to grow strategically by expanding into new geographies and increasing our capabilities in food, beverage, and feed. Those actions contributed to the improved results we saw in the first quarter despite muted margin environments in some businesses. The continued momentum in the execution of our plan gives us confidence that we will deliver sustainable value creation.

This is a rock-solid business sporting a low valuation compared with the rest of the market, all while it generates plenty of cash to do things like expand the business and maintain its healthy 3% dividend yield. For retired value investors, there's a lot to love.
A cheap dividend growth stock hiding in plain sight
Jason Hall (Phillips 66): Shares of Phillips 66 are trading a little above one-year lows, down more than 10% since the start of the year. At the same time, the company has seen its earnings fall sharply over the past couple of years, as refining margins have been squeezed by falling crude prices around the world. This situation has the company trading at more than 24 times the past year's earnings, a number that's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination.
But now's a bad time to evaluate Phillips 66 based on last year's earnings -- especially after the results the company posted to start the year. Not only was this a solid quarter for the company's refining business, which reported a near tripling of its profits year over year, but the midstream and chemicals segments also reported profit growth on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. All told, quarterly profit increased 40% year over year, and 267% sequentially. With the growth of its midstream and chemicals segments combining with an expected bounce-back in refinings, full-year profits are on track to come in well above last year's levels, and that makes Phillips 66 cheap, trading at 12 times projected 2017 earnings. 
Furthermore, the company's management is relentlessly focused on using cash flow growth to fund regular dividend increases. The company just announced an 11% dividend raise, putting the yield at 3.6% at recent prices. Since 2012, the company has increased its dividend 350%. 
Put it all together, and Phillips 66 is a dividend growth stock at a bargain price. That's ideal for retirement investors.

Trust the best in the world to help you beat the market
Steve Symington (Berkshire Hathaway): Normally I favor dividend-paying stocks for retired investors, so it might be a surprise that I'm arguing for Berkshire Hathaway as a compelling buy. As fellow Fool Matthew Frankel pointed out recently, though renowned value investor and Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett loves to pack his company's enviable portfolio full of generous dividend payers, he has famously shunned the prospect of his company paying a dividend. Instead, Buffett has consistently demonstrated his unrivaled ability to compound shareholder value by reinvesting in Berkshire's existing businesses, acquiring new businesses, or buying back Berkshire Hathaway shares. On the latter, Buffett has historically preferred to buy back shares only if Berkshire Hathaway stock falls below 1.2 times book value -- an exceedingly attractive price for a business of this caliber.
But at Berkshire's recent annual shareholder meeting, Buffett surprised investors by hinting that the company may consider initiating a dividend if it can't find a better way to put some of its roughly $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasury bills to work. In addition, Berkshire is looking at whether to raise its acceptable buyback floor to a slightly higher but still attractive level. Either way, trying to find the best way to put all of Berkshire Hathaway's money to work is an enviable problem to have. And with Berkshire Hathaway stock currently trading at a reasonable 1.37 times book value as of this writing, I think retired investors would do well to pick up shares and trust Warren Buffett to extend his market-beating ways. 
",3 Value Stocks for Retirement
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/24/heres-how-to-find-the-best-dividend-stocks.aspx,2017-05-24,"
Finding a great dividend stock is about more than just finding the stock with the biggest yield. Sure, when dividends are your focus, the dividend yield is the most important number. But there are a number of other factors you also need to consider.
For example, you might find a stock paying a great dividend today. But if the company isn't generating the free cash flow necessary to fund its dividend, it might be forced to cut its dividend tomorrow -- in which case, you'll be in the unfortunate position of owning a not-so-great dividend stock, and probably one whose stock price is plummeting as other investors flee the falling dividend.
Of course, if falling dividends are bad, it makes sense that growing dividends must be good, right? In this case, you might also want to look into a dividend stock's payout ratio. This metric expresses as a percentage the dividends a company pays relative to the earnings it uses to pay them. A stock with a 100% payout ratio, for example, may be ""maxed out"" and financially incapable of growing its dividend. Conversely, a dividend stock with a payout ratio of only 50% might have ample room to grow its dividend over time.
Analyst projections for rising earnings are another indicator that over time, a stock that pays a good dividend today might pay an even better dividend tomorrow.

A GREAT DIVIDEND MAKES EVERYONE SMILE. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

With these considerations in mind, I've taken the liberty of drawing up a screen on free stock screening website finviz.com). I've instructed it to search for:

Reasonably large, established companies, with a $2 billion in market cap and up.
A respectable dividend (at least 3%).
Companies that devote less than 70% of annual profits to dividend payouts.
Positive free cash flow.
Companies projected to continue earning, and growing earnings, over the next five years.

The following are three stocks that appear to fit the bill. Go ahead -- read on and give them a look, and see if you agree.
Boeing 
You probably know that Boeing (NYSE:BA) makes great airplanes, but did you know that it also pays a great dividend? At 3.1%, Boeing's dividend yield is almost half again as big as the average payout of S&P 500 companies. Yet at the same time, Boeing's P/E ratio of 21.6 is nearly four points cheaper than the average valuation of 25.4 times earnings on the S&P. 
What's more, Boeing's $5.68-per-share annual dividend represents only 58% of reported net income -- the aforementioned payout ratio -- which lends some assurance that its dividend is ""safe."" Adding further assurance is the fact that, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Boeing generated $9 billion in free cash flow over the past year. That's more than enough to cover Boeing's dividend obligations -- it's almost twice Boeing's reported net profits.
Furthermore, analysts who follow the company expect to see Boeing grow its profits at about 16% annually over the next five years -- giving the company plenty of opportunity to continue growing its dividend. That Boeing has booked orders for more than 5,700 aircraft  that still remain to be built and delivered, with more orders coming in every day, supports analysts' belief that Boeing will be growing its profits, and its dividends, for years to come.
Vale S.A.
Producing iron ore and pellets, coal, and even precious metals, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) seems like a name that more investors should know. But being based in Brazil, it's a name that may fly too low to have appeared on all investors' radar.
That would be a shame, though, because Vale stock has a lot to recommend it to value investors and dividend investors alike. (It's not just me saying that, either. Last week, investment banker BMO highlighted Vale as a stock with 22% upside potential.) In terms of valuation, Vale stock sells for a lowly 9.3 P/E ratio. (Some investors may worry that the company is being sued by Brazilian authorities over its role in the 2015 Samarco mine disaster, but with the lawsuit now suspended, and a settlement being worked out, that risk may not be as big as once feared).
And as for the dividend, it yields a tidy 4%, making Vale a more generous dividend payer than Boeing, despite earning a bit less than Boeing does ($4.7 billion annually) and also generating less free cash flow ($5.6 billion). Still, there's plenty of profit, and cash, to finance the generous dividend payout.
With its annual dividend payout of $0.34 per share, and diluted earnings per share of $0.91, I calculate the dividend payout ratio at about 37%, which leaves plenty of room for expanding the dividend as well. With analysts on average estimating that Vale will grow not much slower than Boeing -- 15% annually over the next five years -- I see every likelihood that dividends will, in fact, grow over time.

Valero 
And I think we'll wrap up with yet another story of respectable growth wrapped in a value stock package: oil refiner Valero (NYSE:VLO).
Valero just wrapped up its Q1 earnings last month, reporting rising profit margin and better-than-expected earnings. With those numbers in the bag, Valero stock now sells for a very attractive P/E ratio of just 13.8 -- and because Valero, like the other stocks on this list, generates more cash from its business than it reports as net income, and an even better price-to-free cash flow ratio of just 7.6.
But Valero is more than just another pretty value stock. It also sports the best dividend yield on today's list, weighing in at 4.3%. Even so, its annual dividend payments of $2.80 per share represent just 55% of net profit.
What's Valero's incentive to grow those profits? That depends, as the company may prove cautious about boosting payments in the face of a topsy-turvy oil market that's seen recent price spikes in response to oil production cutbacks by Russia and OPEC. Still, with most analysts agreeing Valero has the ability to grow its profits at a respectable 13% annual rate over the next five years, I see potential for this dividend, too, to grow. 
",Here's How to Find the Best Dividend Stocks
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/24/heres-how-to-find-the-best-dividend-stocks.aspx,2017-05-24,"
Finding a great dividend stock is about more than just finding the stock with the biggest yield. Sure, when dividends are your focus, the dividend yield is the most important number. But there are a number of other factors you also need to consider.
For example, you might find a stock paying a great dividend today. But if the company isn't generating the free cash flow necessary to fund its dividend, it might be forced to cut its dividend tomorrow -- in which case, you'll be in the unfortunate position of owning a not-so-great dividend stock, and probably one whose stock price is plummeting as other investors flee the falling dividend.
Of course, if falling dividends are bad, it makes sense that growing dividends must be good, right? In this case, you might also want to look into a dividend stock's payout ratio. This metric expresses as a percentage the dividends a company pays relative to the earnings it uses to pay them. A stock with a 100% payout ratio, for example, may be ""maxed out"" and financially incapable of growing its dividend. Conversely, a dividend stock with a payout ratio of only 50% might have ample room to grow its dividend over time.
Analyst projections for rising earnings are another indicator that over time, a stock that pays a good dividend today might pay an even better dividend tomorrow.

A GREAT DIVIDEND MAKES EVERYONE SMILE. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

With these considerations in mind, I've taken the liberty of drawing up a screen on free stock screening website finviz.com). I've instructed it to search for:

Reasonably large, established companies, with a $2 billion in market cap and up.
A respectable dividend (at least 3%).
Companies that devote less than 70% of annual profits to dividend payouts.
Positive free cash flow.
Companies projected to continue earning, and growing earnings, over the next five years.

The following are three stocks that appear to fit the bill. Go ahead -- read on and give them a look, and see if you agree.
Boeing 
You probably know that Boeing (NYSE:BA) makes great airplanes, but did you know that it also pays a great dividend? At 3.1%, Boeing's dividend yield is almost half again as big as the average payout of S&P 500 companies. Yet at the same time, Boeing's P/E ratio of 21.6 is nearly four points cheaper than the average valuation of 25.4 times earnings on the S&P. 
What's more, Boeing's $5.68-per-share annual dividend represents only 58% of reported net income -- the aforementioned payout ratio -- which lends some assurance that its dividend is ""safe."" Adding further assurance is the fact that, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Boeing generated $9 billion in free cash flow over the past year. That's more than enough to cover Boeing's dividend obligations -- it's almost twice Boeing's reported net profits.
Furthermore, analysts who follow the company expect to see Boeing grow its profits at about 16% annually over the next five years -- giving the company plenty of opportunity to continue growing its dividend. That Boeing has booked orders for more than 5,700 aircraft  that still remain to be built and delivered, with more orders coming in every day, supports analysts' belief that Boeing will be growing its profits, and its dividends, for years to come.
Vale S.A.
Producing iron ore and pellets, coal, and even precious metals, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) seems like a name that more investors should know. But being based in Brazil, it's a name that may fly too low to have appeared on all investors' radar.
That would be a shame, though, because Vale stock has a lot to recommend it to value investors and dividend investors alike. (It's not just me saying that, either. Last week, investment banker BMO highlighted Vale as a stock with 22% upside potential.) In terms of valuation, Vale stock sells for a lowly 9.3 P/E ratio. (Some investors may worry that the company is being sued by Brazilian authorities over its role in the 2015 Samarco mine disaster, but with the lawsuit now suspended, and a settlement being worked out, that risk may not be as big as once feared).
And as for the dividend, it yields a tidy 4%, making Vale a more generous dividend payer than Boeing, despite earning a bit less than Boeing does ($4.7 billion annually) and also generating less free cash flow ($5.6 billion). Still, there's plenty of profit, and cash, to finance the generous dividend payout.
With its annual dividend payout of $0.34 per share, and diluted earnings per share of $0.91, I calculate the dividend payout ratio at about 37%, which leaves plenty of room for expanding the dividend as well. With analysts on average estimating that Vale will grow not much slower than Boeing -- 15% annually over the next five years -- I see every likelihood that dividends will, in fact, grow over time.

",Here's How to Find the Best Dividend Stocks
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/23/why-costco-wholesale-corporation-shareholders-have.aspx,2017-05-23,"
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) has been one of the strongest retail stocks in recent years. Shares have more than doubled over the last five years, outperforming the S&P 500 at a time when most of its competitors have suffered.
While its brick-and-mortar peers struggle to overcome e-commerce competition and falling mall traffic, Costco benefits from a membership model that has given it a sticky customer base. Members are happy to scour the big box's aisles for bulk goods and surprises, a privilege that a $60 annual membership fee grants them.

Image source: Costco.

However, while Costco's business has remained stronger than most, with comparable sales consistently climbing, there are some concerns investors should be aware of. Here are a few reasons why Costco shareholders have something to worry about.
1. The valuation is pricey
While Costco shares have more doubled over the last five years, that appreciation isn't entirely due to profit growth. Its earnings multiple has also expanded alongside the market, and the stock now trades at a P/E of 32.

WMT PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts.
That is significantly more expensive than its peers as it exceeds Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) P/E of 18, Kroger's at 14, and Target's at 11. In other words, the market is expecting the warehouse retailer to deliver about twice the level of profit growth of its peers. No other large brick-and-mortar retailer carries such a high valuation, and it may be difficult for Costco to beat those expectations. After the wholesaler raised its membership fee by $5 this year, to $60, analysts expect profits to increase 13% next year, to $6.39, but they will likely slow after that. The stock has proven resilient thus far, but a sustained slowdown in profit growth would slash its valuation.
2. E-commerce is a weakness
In a way, Costco's ability to thrive without a strong e-commerce operation in this era is a testament to the strength of its core business. While many brick-and-mortar chains have had to adapt their business models to fend off Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Costco's stores are a shopping destination with the power to draw customers through savings and the ""treasure hunt"" effect.
However, rivals like Amazon and Wal-Mart are working to leverage the power of e-commerce. Wal-Mart, for example, now offers grocery pickup for online orders at close to a thousand stores. Amazon is experimenting with such a model, and has expanded its Fresh grocery-delivery service to more than a dozen metro areas. Costco's online sales make up less than 3% of overall revenue, and the company has resisted conventional upgrades like buy online, pick up in-store. It could, for instance, build out grocery pickup kiosks to match Wal-Mart, but the company sees the strength of its model as bringing customers into the store to make impulse purchases.
The high expense associated with shipping bulk goods to customers' homes generally rules out that option. As Amazon and Wal-Mart continue to invest in e-commerce, Costco could fall behind for good.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-5723');
            });
        

3. Stores are getting less efficient
Costco's comparable sales are still positive, and the company continues to open new stores, but according to one popular metric, the company is becoming less efficient. Sales per square foot measures how efficiently retailers use their real estate, and is an important metric in determining customer demand.
In each of Costco's last two fiscal years, sales per square foot has declined, as the chart below shows, following a trend in decelerating same-store sales growth.

Data source: Costco 10-K filings.
At $1,150 in revenue per square foot, Costco still generates much more revenue than comparable stores, but the company's model produces lower profit margins than competitors like Wal-Mart or Target, so it needs to have higher sales volumes. While many retailers have scaled back on new-store openings, Costco has continued to expand, but if this number keeps falling, management may have to question that strategy.
Unlike some other retailers, Costco isn't about to crumble, but the industry and consumer expectations are quickly shifting around it. The next 10 years for the company will likely not be as easy as the last 10.

",Why Costco Wholesale Corporation Shareholders Have Something to Worry About
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/26/1-underdog-stock-im-watching.aspx,2017-05-26,"
When a company's stock seems cheap, there's usually a reason. Often, it's because the company isn't a good investment: It may have been outpaced by competitors, loaded down with debt, or burdened by poor management decisions.
Generally, it's best to avoid those stocks. But sometimes, those underdogs are actually good companies that have hit rough patches. If management is up to the task of a turnaround, those stocks can be good buys. Here are three underdog stocks that our Foolish contributors are watching now: Under Armour (NYSE:UA), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). 
This underdog could rebound
Keith Noonan (Under Armour): Over the last year, Under Armour has gone from stock market darling to one of the S&P 500 index's biggest losers, but it's a company that I think still has big potential, and I'm keeping an eye on its stock with an interest in initiating a position.

^SPX data by YCharts.
While I do see potential for a rebound, it's undeniable that the apparel-maker's growth story has taken some unflattering turns. Sales growth has slowed substantially (last quarter actually saw domestic sales slip 1% year over year), and key product releases including the Curry 3 sneaker have failed to meet expectations -- casting doubt over the brand's ability to move upmarket and take advantage of premium pricing. Disappointing guidance and signs that the brand's appeal might be softening have also left analysts wondering whether the company's best days are behind it. 

Image source: Under Armour.

So, there are sensible reasons to be down on the company and its stock, but here's why I'm interested. Under Armour currently generates only around 20% of its revenues from international markets, and overseas sales are still growing at a rapid clip with lots of room to run. This dynamic is especially true in large markets like China, where tailwinds like increased interest in basketball and football and an expanding middle class could mean big things for the company. Under Armour also has opportunities in connected fitness and expanding women's apparel sales, but it's the long-term international growth potential that makes it a stock to watch.    
From top dog to underdog
Keith Speights (Gilead Sciences): It wasn't all that long ago that Gilead Sciences was the darling of biotech investors. The company dominated the HIV marketplace with megablockbuster drugs like Atripla and Truvada. Gilead also blew up the hepatitis C virus (HCV) market with the first drug to actually cure the dreaded disease -- Sovaldi.
That was then. Things are much different now. While Gilead still makes a lot of money (nearly $13.5 billion in profit last year), the biotech is no longer viewed as a darling by investors. Gilead is more of a dud these days.

Image source: Getty Images.

Curing HCV was great at first. However, the number of patients began to dwindle as the sickest patients took Sovaldi and its successor, Harvoni, and no longer needed treatment. Gilead also faced competition from rivals with drugs that also boasted high cure rates for HCV.
Gilead now finds itself at a major crossroads. Its HIV franchise continues to perform well, but HCV product sales are tanking. Although the biotech's pipeline includes several promising candidates, especially in the potentially lucrative market for treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), commercialization for most of the drugs remains a few years off -- assuming all goes well in clinical studies.
I'm watching Gilead Sciences closely to see what acquisition the big biotech will make since the company's executives have hinted at possibly pursuing a sizable deal. Many investors, including me, eagerly await to find out which biotech (or possibly biotechs) Gilead might pursue. Gilead has gone from top dog to underdog, but I suspect there's plenty of bark and bite left in the company.

Can a new CEO recharge this former investor darling? 
John Rosevear (Ford Motor Company): Right now, the ""underdog"" stock that has my closest attention is one I've owned since 2009, Ford Motor Company. At one point, my investment in Ford was approaching nine-bagger status, but since mid-2014, Ford's shares have slumped in a big way.

F data by YCharts. 
What happened? Let's put it this way: The charismatic leader of Ford's turnaround, CEO Alan Mulally, retired on June 30, 2014. The chart above begins the next day. 
To be fair, Mulally's hand-picked successor, Mark Fields, didn't do a bad job. Among other achievements, he delivered Ford's two most profitable years ever in 2015 and 2016. But investor confidence in Ford ebbed amid concerns that Fields wasn't moving as quickly to boost profits and embrace new technologies as some rivals (in particular, General Motors). Now, Ford's formerly high-flying stock is an underdog.

Ford's board of directors finally responded to investor concerns last week, ushering Fields into an early retirement and appointing Jim Hackett to replace him. Hackett is a turnaround veteran (he was CEO of Steelcase for many years) known for building strong teams and inspiring employees with a clear vision -- two keys to the success that Mulally had while running Ford. Hackett is also known as a tech-savvy leader: Before becoming CEO, he was running Ford's future-tech subsidiary, Ford Smart Mobility LLC. 
Will Hackett be able to bring back some of Mulally's magic to lead Ford more aggressively into the tech-enabled shared-mobility future? I think there's a good chance that the answer is ""yes,"" but that's what I'm watching to find out.

",1 Underdog Stock I'm Watching
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/23/these-stocks-have-doubled-in-2017.aspx,2017-05-23,"
The stock market has done reasonably well so far in 2017, with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) enjoying total returns of about 7% and remaining close to all-time record levels. But some stocks have done a lot better than the overall market, and shareholders in those companies have made a killing. In particular, Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED), Weight Watchers International (NYSE:WTW), and Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) have all doubled in the first five months of 2017, and some investors wonder if they have even further to climb in the near future.

OLED data by YCharts.
Universal Display is anything but flat
Universal Display has been a leading company in producing organic light emitting diodes for flat-panel displays, including both large formats like television sets and smaller footprints like mobile devices. The company has been working to expand its production capacity recently, and many investors have hoped that big orders for OLED displays would eventually come.
Most of the gains so far in 2017 have come from reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is considering using OLED screens in its future iPhone products, and that could result in a huge boost in demand for the displays from Universal Display. So far, Universal Display has been a bit vague about the prospects for an OLED iPhone, but that's not unusual for a company seeking to do business with the mobile-device pioneer. With rising guidance for revenue and expectations for increased production, shareholders are betting that the iPhone effect will boost Universal Display's fundamentals going forward, and that's enough to justify a big move in the shares this year.

Weight Watchers picks up steam
Weight Watchers International has been a popular stock recently, although it has also been a volatile one. In 2015, the stock rose more than fivefold in just a matter of months, and coming into 2017, the weight-loss specialist had seen plenty of ups and downs as investors weighed the impact of celebrity Oprah Winfrey's presence as a major shareholder and participant in Weight Watchers' prospects.
Yet this year, Weight Watchers has earned its upward moves through strong fundamental performance. In March, the company reported a 10% rise in memberships, with solid international growth pointing to opportunities for geographical expansion. May saw another strong quarter, with Weight Watchers reversing a loss in the year-earlier period and hiring former Home Shopping Network CEO Mindy Grossman to take over as CEO in July. Rising guidance also helped push shares higher, and Weight Watchers appears to have the business success to justify this year's stock price rise.

            });
        

Exact Sciences has a winner
Finally, Exact Sciences has posted the biggest return of these three stocks, with gains of 138% so far in 2017. The company has found a hit with its Cologuard test for colon cancer, offering patients a chance to have a diagnostic test run for the disease without the discomfort and full cost of a colonoscopy. Demand for Cologuard has been extremely strong, with 100,000 tests done in the first quarter representing 150% growth in just the past year. Insurance reimbursement availability for the test has increased, and that has spurred more customers to consider Cologuard.
One problem that some investors have with Exact Sciences is that it hasn't yet been able to turn the explosive sales growth in Cologuard into bottom-line profits. Indeed, even the big rise in test sales was only enough to cut its loss in the first quarter by a little more than 25%. Few expect Exact Sciences to be profitable in 2017 despite calls for continued increases in test sales, and that explains why the stock has actually given back some ground since hitting higher levels in early May.
Stocks don't double in such a short period of time that often, and there's almost always a catalyst to explain the sudden move. From a fundamental perspective, Weight Watchers has arguably seen the most dramatic turnaround in its financials, but both Universal Display and Exact Sciences have potential that investors are banking on seeing in the near future.

",These Stocks Have Doubled in 2017
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/23/3-brick-and-mortar-retailers-with-strong-e-commerc.aspx,2017-05-23,"
When investors talk about e-commerce, Amazon.com is often the first company that comes to mind. But plenty of brick-and-mortar retailers have built solid online businesses as well.
Omnichannel has become a buzzword in retail, the notion that retailers must be proficient in both the traditional retail channel as well as the digital one. The benefits are clear, as physical stores can serve as fulfillment centers for online orders as well as sites for order pick-up and return. Even Amazon seems to be developing an interest in bricks and mortar, as the company has opened a handful of bookstores around the country and is also testing physical locations for grocery retail.
As e-commerce continues to take share from physical retail, it seems that brick-and-mortar chains with strong e-commerce operations will be the best-positioned for the future.
Below are three traditional retailers that derive a significant portion of their sales online.

Image source: Nordstrom.

1. Nordstrom 
Shares of the upscale department store chain have gotten battered lately as department store stocks have reported sliding sales and profits, but Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is better positioned than its rivals to continue to grow in the future. While its full-line department stores continue to be a point of weakness, with comparable sales falling 6.4% last year, less than half of its sales come from those stores. Nordstrom also has a successful off-price brand in Nordstrom Rack, and an e-commerce business that contributed 21.8% of sales last year. Last year, revenue at Nordstrom.com grew 9.5% to $2.52 billion and online sales at its off-price brand jumped 31.7% to $700 million.
While the 9.5% clip is slower than overall online sales growth around 15%, Nordstrom has a head start over its department store competitors and growth on its namesake site, and that growth will become more important as consumers continue to shift to e-commerce.
2. L Brands
L Brands (NYSE:LB), the Victoria's Secret-parent company, has also built a strong e-commerce business as its catalog business and well known brand have primed customers for online sales.
E-commerce sales made up $1.58 billion in sales last year at the Victoria's Secret brand, the equivalent of 20.3% of total domestic sales from the brand. Online sales for Victoria's Secret grew just 1.5% last year, a sign that the brand itself may be experiencing weakness beyond the standard problems with mall-based retailers.
In the first quarter of this year, online sales at Victoria's Secret actually fell disproportionately as the company exited the swim and apparel business.
However, online growth has been stronger at L Brands' secondary business, Bath & Body Works. Though online sales at that chain make up just 11.3% of total sales with $452 million last year, that figure grew 25% from the year before. In the first quarter, it jumped another 22%. 
Still, Victoria's Secret makes up the bulk of the company's business. Keep your eye on its direct sales to see if the brand can make a comeback, as the stock is off sharply this year even after a burst of its first-quarter earnings report.

3. Williams-Sonoma
Like Victoria's Secret, Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) had a solid catalog business before it transitioned into e-commerce. The high-end home-furnishing specialist derives a greater percentage of its sales from the online channel than even the two companies above. 
In fact, a majority of Williams-Sonoma now comes from the online channel, as e-commerce sales made up 51.8% of total revenue last year. Online sales grew just 4.4% last year at the company, which also owns Pottery Barn and West Elm. Brick-and-mortar sales, meanwhile, were virtually flat.
Williams-Sonoma is adjusting its marketing strategy to support e-commerce as it cuts back on catalog circulation and makes digital its largest investment channel. Williams-Sonoma will report first-quarter earnings next week, and online sales growth should continue to guide the company's fortunes.
All three of these companies cater to a higher-end customer, which may explain why they have better-than-average e-commerce divisions -- wealthier Americans tend to shop online more.
Those e-commerce businesses have not yet helped these stocks, as all three are down over the last three years, while the S&P 500 is up 25%. Brick-and-mortar operations continue to weigh on overall operations.
Though strong online sales offer an advantage over other retailers, these companies still must demonstrate growth. If e-commerce continues to stagnate, expects the stocks to flounder as well.

Scour the rows of greetings cards, and one can be assured they'll find plenty of cards to celebrate 40th birthdays -- none for 43, though. And not just 40, but 50 and 60 and so on. We love round numbers. Really love them.
The market is no different.
Plenty of hoopla recently surrounded the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) breaking 20,000 for the first time, and as of this writing, several headlines are addressing Bitcoin's first crossing of the $1,900 mark. How about gold? The yellow metal has never crossed the $2,000  per ounce threshold. The actions of central banks, weak global growth, and higher inflation could all influence the metal to climb higher, but let's dig into a not-so-far-fetched scenario that could lead it to break new ground.

Fear and loathing in the U.S.
Love him or hate him, it's fair to say that President Trump has caused quite a stir during the first few months of his administration. Though this may bring joy to news junkies who enjoy pundits pontificating on nightly news shows, it also brings concern to the market. And when concern -- read: fear -- grows in the market, investors turn away from stocks and toward gold, sending prices higher.
Consider the week before Trump's trip to the Middle East during which he fired FBI Director Comey. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) fell 0.84% and 0.06%, respectively, the price of gold rose about 1.5%, according to the World Gold Council.

With the specter of impeachment rising from both sides of the aisle, more volatility certainly lies on the horizon. Granted, the president may never actually be impeached, but the Dow's nearly 400-point plunge illustrates how the fear of uncertainty can inspire major market movement in and of itself.
Losing interest 
Following a rate hike in December 2016, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates this past March, illustrating its belief that the American economy is strengthening. And based on previous statements, the market anticipates two more rate hikes in 2017. Traditionally, a rise in interest rates has an adverse effect on the price of gold since investors will turn to higher-yielding vehicles than the yellow metal, which offers no yield.
Although the prevailing sentiment is that the Fed will raise rates twice more this year, there's reason to believe this may not come to fruition. According to USA Today, James Bullard, St. Louis Federal Reserve chief, indicated the strategy of raising rates twice more may be ""overly aggressive."" 
Low interest rates often lead to higher gold prices, but If the rate hikes don't come to pass, the market may interpret this as a troubling sign -- a harbinger of a downward turn in the American economy. Consequently, gold prices would likely climb on the backs of investors' uncertainty.

Turning from green to gold
The weakening dollar could be a third factor that causes gold to rocket higher. According to the dollar index, the U.S. dollar has reached its lowest level in the past six months, and if this trend continues, it could inspire investors to flock to the traditional safe-haven investment. Measuring the U.S. dollar against several foreign currencies -- the euro, Japanese yen, Pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, and and Swiss franc -- the dollar index provides a glimpse into how the rest of the world perceives the U.S. economy.
What inspires bearish sentiment of the dollar? For one, the growth of the U.S. economy, or lack thereof, could result in the dollar losing ground to foreign currencies. According to government data, for example, the U.S. economy experienced meager growth in the first quarter of 2017: Gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 0.7%, its slowest pace in three years.

Image source: Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Although many economists suggest the economy is poised to rebound throughout 2017, the prospect a slowing U.S. economy should not be immediately dismissed. In the first quarter of 2017, consumer debt grew to $12.73 trillion, eclipsing the $12.68 trillion from the third quarter in 2008 -- and we all know know what happened then. Granted, student loans account for a larger portion of consumer debt now, not housing, but it stands to reason that if college graduates are busy paying off student loans, they're not spending money on goods and services, which could bolster the economy.
Investor takeaway
Uncertainty in Washington, the absence of interest rate hikes, and a fall in the dollar are all factors tied, individually, to the rise in the price of gold. Should these three factors all occur concurrently, however, it could create a scenario which results in market participants racing to increase their positions in gold -- a scenario that could very reasonably result in the metal breaking new ground, reaching $2,000.

For investors with the patience to let their gains compound for years, buying and holding high-quality dividend stocks is the best way to predictably generate wealth over the long term. But given the S&P 500's strong historical average return of roughly 10%, finding dividend stocks that can actually beat the market is easier said than done.
To that end, we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to discuss dividend stock winners that they believe investors would be wise to consider buying today. Read on to learn why they chose NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), CareTrust REIT (NASDAQ:CTRE), and PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP).

Image source: Getty Images.

This high-flying dividend payer is just getting started
Steve Symington (NVIDIA): Given its stellar performance in recent years, it's easy to forget that NVIDIA pays a modest dividend yielding 0.4% annually as of this writing. After all, shares of the graphics chip specialist have more than tripled over the past year alone, including a nearly 30% pop so far in 2017.
But that rise happened with good reason. Wall Street has consistently underestimated the potential of NVIDIA's high-performance GPUs to revolutionize multiple high-growth industries. Last quarter, for example, NVIDIA achieved double-digit revenue growth in three of its five market platforms, including gaming (up 49% year over year to $1.027 billion), data centers (up 186% to $409 million), and automotive (up 24% to $140 million). All told, NVIDIA's consolidated quarterly revenue climbed 48% year over year to $1.937 billion, while earnings per share jumped 126% to $0.79 -- both crushing expectations in what is typically supposed to be its slowest quarter of the year. 
What's more, earlier this month NVIDIA introduced its new Volta GPU platform, which -- with its 5x-performance improvement over NVIDIA's current-generation Pascal GPU architecture -- will focus on automating artificial intelligence and accelerating high-performance computing (HPC) and graphics workloads. In particular, NVIDIA believes Volta is poised to become the new standard for HPC and even further accelerate its stellar growth in the data center market.
So despite NVIDIA's incredible gains so far, I still think the stock has room to continue to reward long-term investors from here.
This new winner is built to grow for decades
Jason Hall (CareTrust REIT): While shares of rehab and senior housing facility owner CareTrust REIT are barely up 2% since spinning out of Ensign Group in 2014, total returns, including dividends, have made it a market-crushing investment:

CTRE Total Return Price data by YCharts.
A big part of that return was a huge one-time special dividend of $5.88 per share paid after going public. CareTrust has also increased its regular dividend a whopping 48%, including a 9% increase in 2017. 
There's plenty of reason to count on management being able to regularly pump up the payout going forward. To start, the U.S. is entering into a period of people reaching retirement age unlike anything we've ever experienced. Over the next 15-plus years, an average of 3.5 million Americans will reach retirement age every year, a trend which will nearly double the country's 65-and-older population in about 20 years. 
This will create a lot of demand for the skilled nursing, rehab, and senior housing facilities CareTrust buys, builds, and owns. And with less than 150 properties in its portfolio to date, CareTrust is in a unique position as a very small player in a very big growth industry. 
Its growth so far is paying off. Even after increasing the payout by 9% this year, CareTrust pays out less than 70% of funds from operations. This is a nice measure of safety, as well as an extra tool combined with debt and share issuance, to help fund new acquisitions. If management can continue its excellent capital allocation, CareTrust could be a winning dividend stock for decades.

You'll drink to this dividend stock
Dan Caplinger (PepsiCo): Consumer products companies make great dividend payers, and PepsiCo has an impressive track record in returning capital to its shareholders through dividends. The beverage and snack giant has raised its quarterly payouts annually for 45 straight years now, and its dividend yield near 3% is still well above what you'll find from the typical dividend stock in the market right now.
PepsiCo has had to overcome some challenges recently, as consumers have shifted away from sugary carbonated beverages like its namesake cola in favor of what they perceive as healthier offerings. However, PepsiCo had a head start in adapting to the new emphasis on healthy snacks and drinks, as CEO Indra Nooyi foresaw and even helped to spearhead changing behavior among customers of the company's various businesses, which include not only Pepsi but also snack giant Frito-Lay and other household names like Quaker Oats. As a result, PepsiCo has been able to answer the call even as rivals have had to scurry to change their strategic direction.
Going forward, PepsiCo still has plenty of growth potential left. And given its history of passing on its bounty to shareholders through its quarterly payouts, dividend investors can look forward to participating in PepsiCo's growth for a long time to come.

Financial stocks saw some of the heaviest trading, but the popular Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) edged past the broader market with a 0.3% increase. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEMKT:GDX), meanwhile, tracked the small uptick in gold prices by rising 0.7%.
As for individual stocks, Dicks Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) and SINA (NASDAQ:SINA) made big moves following the companies' quarterly earnings releases.

Dicks Sporting Goods lowers expectations
Dicks Sporting Goods shares dropped almost 14% following first-quarter earnings results that showed mounting pressure on the retailer's sales growth trends. Revenue at existing locations rose 2.4%, which was below the guidance range that management issued in early March, when it predicted gains of between 3% and 4%. Earnings met analysts' expectations, however, as profitability held steady and the company trimmed its expenses. Yet inventory rose by 10%, outpacing revenue gains and pointing to the potential for declining margins ahead.

Executives stressed the steady sales growth trends in an unusually weak quarter for retailers. ""Despite a challenging retail environment,"" CEO Edward Stack said in a press release, ""we realized growth across each of our three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear."" Management also highlighted the double-digit gains Dicks saw in the e-commerce sales channel, which ticked up to 9.3% of sales from 9.2% a year ago.
Dicks still plans to continue plowing resources into its online division while also opening 43 new sporting goods locations this year, in addition to eight new stores under the Golf Galaxy brand. The retailing slowdown will pinch overall results in 2017, though. Stack and his team lowered their full-year guidance to comparable-store gains of between 1% and 3% from the prior target of 2% to 3%. Either result would represent a decline from last year's 3.5% boost.

SINA accelerates revenue growth
Chinese internet platform SINA jumped 17% after announcing surprisingly strong first-quarter results. A surge in advertising demand pushed revenue up 40% to $275.5 million, compared to consensus estimates that were targeting $265.1 million. Gross profit margin soared to 69% of sales from 59%, and that improvement helped the company blow past profit expectations. Rather than generating $0.14 per share of earnings, SINA posted $0.50 per share of profit.
CEO Charles Chao focused his remarks on the company's booming social media segment, Weibo, which boosted its base of monthly active users by 30% to 340 million as mobile browsing grew to over 90% of the base. ""We started the year 2017 with a great quarter,"" Chao said. ""Weibo continued its strong momentum with accelerated growth in revenues and impressive expansion of user base.""
Heading into this release, investors had expected SINA to post sales growth of roughly 33% this year as earnings spike by 61% to $2.32 per share. But, given the market-thumping start to the year, those targets may need to rise. SINA's transition into a mobile-dominated platform apparently isn't pressuring its user growth, or its ability to monetize that growing base through advertising sales, and so its profit prospects are brightening.
",What Happened in the Stock Market Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/25/3-stocks-at-52-week-highs-still-worth-buying.aspx,2017-05-25,"
Stocks breaking new ground with strong price gains are a dime a dozen. Often, 52-week highs can be frustratingly transient peaks, levels reached for very particular reasons and then never seen again. In the long run, you're really looking for stocks primed to set price records -- again and again.
We asked three of our top Motley Fool contributors to share a few investment ideas in that vein, for which prices are riding high today but likely to soar even further in the future. Read on to see why they selected Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX), and Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT).

Image source: Getty Images.

The gift that keeps on giving
Anders Bylund (Netflix): Digital-video veteran Netflix has gone from strength to strength in recent quarters, and its share price has risen more than 60% in 52 weeks.
The five-year picture looks even better, including a 7-for-1 stock split and a near-worldwide service expansion -- along with returns of 1,500%.
In the last 10 years, Netflix has evolved from DVD mailers to digital streaming, survived the Qwikster debacle, and destroyed the old-school video-rental market along the way. Against that backdrop, Netflix investors have enjoyed a 4,650% gain.
If you thought Netflix had reached its maximum value in the summer of 2011, you've missed out on its share price more than quadrupling from that high point. The stock also more than doubled from the all-time highs set three years ago, gained 33% from what might have felt like the end of the line in late 2015, and gained 27% in 2017 alone. And it reached fresh all-time record prices as recently as last week.
If you think that it's different this time -- that Netflix shares are destined to head for lower prices and might never soar this high again -- I'm afraid you still don't see the big picture.
The company has largely completed its worldwide rollout of streaming-video services and turned the spigot to ""profit generation."" Cash flows will remain negative for another few years due to Netflix's ambitious and cash-intensive content-production schedule, but that line will also turn green eventually. Share prices will surely follow suit.
There may be a few bumps in the road ahead, but the long-term value-creation picture is clear. Netflix is the gift that keeps on giving, and will continue to be for years to come.
A trading platform with room to run
Brian Feroldi (MarketAxess Holdings): Stock investors have been buying and selling securities electronically for decades, so you'd be forgiven for assuming that transactions on the fixed-income market happen that way too. However, that's not the case at all. Even today the majority of fixed-income trading takes place in one-on-one transactions over the phone or by email.
MarketAxess Holdings is a company that is trying to change that. It has created what has become the largest electronic bond-trading platform in the world, which enables its users to buy, sell, and research fixed-income securities with ease. Big money managers have been rapidly adopting this new platform for its increased transparency and rapid execution.
Being a top dog and first mover in this marketplace has provided MarketAxess with a big advantage over potential rivals. Buyers and sellers naturally want to gravitate toward the biggest platform since it maximizes their trading opportunities and liquidity. That's allowed MarketAxess' top line to head in the right direction for years. 
What's wonderful about this business is that MarketAxess' platform is highly scalable. Adding one more user and processing one more transaction costs very little, which allows the company's profit growth to outpace revenue growth. As an example, last quarter the company's revenue grew by 17% but its pre-tax income jumped more than 25% thanks to margin expansion. This has been going on for years, which is a big reason why the company's profits -- and stock price -- have been rising quickly.

MKTX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
While MarketAxess has made a lot of progress at bringing the bond markets into the 21st century, the company still has plenty of market share left to capture. That potential hints that MarketAxess' profits should continue to soar for years to come, which I think makes this a top-notch stock to buy even though it is trading at a premium.

An old-school retail titan that's proving it can still keep up with the times
Chuck Saletta (Wal-Mart): Fresh off the news that its online sales surged by over 60% year over year in the most recent quarter, Wal-Mart saw its shares near 52-week highs. The dramatic increase in its ability to sell stuff online -- including a strong push into grocery pickup I suggested four years ago -- is helping the company leverage its physical presence for its electronic sales.
That Wal-Mart is finally figuring out ways to flex its incredible physical-distribution advantage to drive online sales is giving the market hopes that it can thrive in our ever more connected economy. What makes the stock still worth buying today despite trading near its 52-week high is the fact that its shares still look reasonably valued, even after that recent lift.
Wal-Mart recently traded hands at just under 18 times its trailing earnings and around 17 times its forward earnings estimates. In addition, current market prices give shareholders a respectable 2.6% dividend yield, and Wal-Mart has increased that dividend for over 40 consecutive years. In a time when the S&P 500 is trading at around 25 times its trailing earnings and only pays a 1.9% dividend yield, Wal-Mart looks like a relative bargain.
The competition driving the shifting marketplace is real, and Wal-Mart is only starting to establish its course in this era of merging online and offline retail. It has to continually prove its ability to thrive, but as of now, it looks like a recent marketplace winner with the opportunity to continue to grow.

",3 Stocks at 52-Week Highs Still Worth Buying
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/25/3-stocks-at-52-week-highs-still-worth-buying.aspx,2017-05-25,"
Stocks breaking new ground with strong price gains are a dime a dozen. Often, 52-week highs can be frustratingly transient peaks, levels reached for very particular reasons and then never seen again. In the long run, you're really looking for stocks primed to set price records -- again and again.
We asked three of our top Motley Fool contributors to share a few investment ideas in that vein, for which prices are riding high today but likely to soar even further in the future. Read on to see why they selected Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX), and Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT).

The gift that keeps on giving
Anders Bylund (Netflix): Digital-video veteran Netflix has gone from strength to strength in recent quarters, and its share price has risen more than 60% in 52 weeks.
The five-year picture looks even better, including a 7-for-1 stock split and a near-worldwide service expansion -- along with returns of 1,500%.
In the last 10 years, Netflix has evolved from DVD mailers to digital streaming, survived the Qwikster debacle, and destroyed the old-school video-rental market along the way. Against that backdrop, Netflix investors have enjoyed a 4,650% gain.
If you thought Netflix had reached its maximum value in the summer of 2011, you've missed out on its share price more than quadrupling from that high point. The stock also more than doubled from the all-time highs set three years ago, gained 33% from what might have felt like the end of the line in late 2015, and gained 27% in 2017 alone. And it reached fresh all-time record prices as recently as last week.
If you think that it's different this time -- that Netflix shares are destined to head for lower prices and might never soar this high again -- I'm afraid you still don't see the big picture.
The company has largely completed its worldwide rollout of streaming-video services and turned the spigot to ""profit generation."" Cash flows will remain negative for another few years due to Netflix's ambitious and cash-intensive content-production schedule, but that line will also turn green eventually. Share prices will surely follow suit.
There may be a few bumps in the road ahead, but the long-term value-creation picture is clear. Netflix is the gift that keeps on giving, and will continue to be for years to come.
A trading platform with room to run
Brian Feroldi (MarketAxess Holdings): Stock investors have been buying and selling securities electronically for decades, so you'd be forgiven for assuming that transactions on the fixed-income market happen that way too. However, that's not the case at all. Even today the majority of fixed-income trading takes place in one-on-one transactions over the phone or by email.
MarketAxess Holdings is a company that is trying to change that. It has created what has become the largest electronic bond-trading platform in the world, which enables its users to buy, sell, and research fixed-income securities with ease. Big money managers have been rapidly adopting this new platform for its increased transparency and rapid execution.
Being a top dog and first mover in this marketplace has provided MarketAxess with a big advantage over potential rivals. Buyers and sellers naturally want to gravitate toward the biggest platform since it maximizes their trading opportunities and liquidity. That's allowed MarketAxess' top line to head in the right direction for years. 
What's wonderful about this business is that MarketAxess' platform is highly scalable. Adding one more user and processing one more transaction costs very little, which allows the company's profit growth to outpace revenue growth. As an example, last quarter the company's revenue grew by 17% but its pre-tax income jumped more than 25% thanks to margin expansion. This has been going on for years, which is a big reason why the company's profits -- and stock price -- have been rising quickly.

While MarketAxess has made a lot of progress at bringing the bond markets into the 21st century, the company still has plenty of market share left to capture. That potential hints that MarketAxess' profits should continue to soar for years to come, which I think makes this a top-notch stock to buy even though it is trading at a premium.

",3 Stocks at 52-Week Highs Still Worth Buying
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/22/2-most-wildly-overvalued-stocks-in-the-internet-of.aspx,2017-05-22,"
The Internet of Things -- where formerly unconnected things are connected to the Internet -- is on its way to becoming a $1.29 trillion market by 2020. That potential has led a lot of tech companies, and investors, to make big bets on the Internet of Things (IoT), sometimes at the cost of reasonable valuations. 
Specifically, GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) caught my eye recently. The two companies are hardly pure-plays in the IoT (there aren't many of those), but each is betting on the Internet of Things in its own way, and each looks a bit overpriced right now.


Image source: GoPro.

GoPro currently has a valuation of more than $1.2 billion and is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (what analysts expect the company to earn in the future) of 52. Meanwhile, Marvell trades at a hefty 387 times its current earnings. To put all of these numbers a bit into context, consider that the average P/E ratio in the S&P 500 is about 24.  
GoPro is, of course, known for its action cameras, which fall into the connected wearable camera subcategory of the IoT. The problem for GoPro is that the company's current valuation isn't matching up with its performance. 

The company sold 5.3 million units in 2016, a drop of about 12% from the 6.6 million the year before.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-65831');
            });
        


GoPro's camera sales have not only slipped, but the company suffered a huge setback when it recalled its much-anticipated Karma drone after it was discovered the devices' battery could shift during flight, causing the drone to crash to the ground. The device is back on sale, but the damage to the company's share price and revenues was already done.
GoPro's management has said that it wants to return to profitability in 2017 by increasing efficiencies and reducing costs, but even with those changes, GoPro would need to grow camera sales at an impressive rate to catch back up to the company's current valuation. 
Meanwhile, Marvell builds application processors for a variety of markets, including IoT devices. The company's low-power, inexpensive chips are ideal for IoT devices and are used in everything from industrial equipment and wearable tech to connected cars. 
Marvell is focusing pretty heavily on the automotive segment of the IoT, and that market is expected to be worth $141 billion by 2022 and include 37.7 million vehicles worldwide, up from just 5 million in 2015. 



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-57595');
            });
        



One thing Marvell has going for it that GoPro doesn't is that its forward P/E is much, much lower, coming in at just around 13 right now. The company is in the process of restructuring itself away from its mobile focus to more lucrative businesses in the cloud and data centers. That could eventually pay off for the company, but time will tell exactly how it plays out. 
The company has failed to grow revenues consistently, but it beat Wall Street's revenue and earnings estimates in fiscal Q4 2017, which has helped push the company's share price up. Investors should be pleased with the earnings beat, but eventually, Marvell's increased focus on data centers and the cloud market should help bring revenue increases that are more consistent with a growth stock. If not, this company will continue to look overvalued.

",2 Most Wildly Overvalued Stocks in the Internet of Things
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/25/6-reasons-american-eagle-outfitters-is-a-better-va.aspx,2017-05-25,"
American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) and its rival Gap (NYSE:GPS) both faced similar headwinds in recent years -- sluggish mall traffic, the rise of fast fashion retailers like H&M, and the weed-like growth of e-tailers. Those challenges caused shares of American Eagle and Gap to respectively drop about 40% and 20% over the past five years. During that same period, the S&P 500 rallied almost 80%.
While it's tempting to dismiss both stocks as toxic retail plays, I believe that American Eagle could still be a better value play than Gap for six simple reasons. 

Image source: American Eagle Outfitters.

1. Lower valuations
AEO trades at just 10 times earnings, while Gap trades at 13 times earnings. Both ratios are lower than the industry average P/E of 18 for apparel retailers. Looking ahead, AEO trades at 10 times forward earnings, while Gap has a forward P/E of 11. Therefore, AEO is slightly cheaper than Gap relative to its profit growth.
2. Better comps growth
Lower valuations certainly matter, but the key metric for measuring retailers is comps growth. Let's compare AEO and Gap's comps growth over the past five quarters:
      


 

Q1 2016


Q2 2016


Q3 2016


Q4 2016


Q1 2017

2%




Gap

(3%)*

2%




Source: Quarterly reports. *Impacted by a fire at a distribution center.
AEO generally posts better positive comps growth than Gap. Gap has been reporting better comps growth in the past two quarters, but that can be attributed to much easier year-over-year comparisons. 
Looking ahead, AEO forecasts a ""flat to low single-digit decline"" for the second quarter, but didn't offer guidance for the full year. Gap didn't offer guidance for the current quarter, but expects its full-year comps to be ""flat to up slightly."" However, Wall Street expects AEO's revenue to rise 2% this year, but for Gap's revenue to remain nearly flat.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-18612');
            });
        

3. A more dependable growth brand
Gap's three-tiered pricing strategy -- with Old Navy at the bottom, its namesake brand in the middle, and Banana Republic at the top -- arguably failed after companies like H&M and Zara lured away customers with clothes that were both cheap and fashionable.
All three of Gap's brands were in decline until the company hired former H&M exec Stefan Larsson to turn around Old Navy in 2012. Thanks to his efforts, Old Navy became Gap's main pillar of growth as the other two brands faded. Old Navy's comps rose 8% last quarter, but Gap and Banana both posted 4% declines.

Image source: Aerie.

Meanwhile, AEO has Aerie, a rapidly growing lingerie and activewear brand for young women. Comps at Aerie surged 25% last quarter, which offset a 1% decline at AEO's namesake brand. Aerie generates a much smaller percentage of AEO's revenue than Old Navy does for Gap, but it likely has more room to run.
4. Better margins
Maintaining margin growth has been tough for apparel retailers. However, AEO still has slightly better operating margins than Gap:

Source: YCharts
AEO's operating margin has been slipping in recent quarters due to increased promotional activity and higher shipping costs from its shipping business, but that could improve as it closes more stores and expands Aerie's footprint.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-51109');
            });
        

5. Lower debt levels
AEO stands out in the retail apparel industry because it doesn't have any debt. Gap, on the other hand, finished last quarter with $1.25 billion in long-term debt -- just a slight decline from $1.32 billion in the prior year quarter.
That clean balance sheet gives AEO a lot of options for growth and expansion. That's probably why it's reportedly mulling a bid for Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF). I'm not a fan of the idea -- since it would make AEO bigger when it should be downsizing -- but it could help AEO cut costs by scaling up, while A&F's namesake brand and Hollister could patch up AEO's weakness in men's apparel. 
6. A higher dividend
AEO currently pays a forward dividend of 4.5%. It hasn't hiked that dividend since 2013, but its low payout ratio of 43% indicates that it could certainly do so in the near future. Gap pays a forward yield of 4.1%, and it's raised that dividend annually for seven straight years. Its payout ratio of 54% is higher than AEO's. 
It's a close call with the dividend, but I personally prefer taking AEO's higher yield (albeit with more limited growth potential) along with the company's other aforementioned strengths.

                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-22741');
            });
        

Should you buy American Eagle Outfitters?
AEO looks like a better overall stock than Gap, but it still isn't for the faint of heart. The recent collapse of other retailers (like Aeropostale, Limited, and American Apparel) could flood the market with cheap clearance items. Aerie's growth could also lose momentum before it becomes big enough to propel AEO's comps forward again. 
But despite these challenges, I'll continue holding my shares of American Eagle Outfitters. It's still the ""best in breed"" company in the troubled apparel retailing industry, and its low valuation, clean balance sheet, and high dividend make it a compelling long-term play.

What happened
Shares of  Barracuda Networks (NYSE:CUDA) fell 12% in April 2017, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The data security specialist presented fourth-quarter results on April 17, triggering a 17% drop the next day.
So what
Barracuda delivered significant growth on both the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter, exceeding analyst estimates across the board. But forward-looking earnings guidance for fiscal year 2018 fell short of the Street's then-current projections, making investors forget all about the reported earnings surprise in a hurry.

Now what
April's woes notwithstanding, Barracuda shares have gained 31% over the last 52 weeks, roughly doubling the S&P 500's return over the same period. The company brings together aspects of two vibrant markets, namely data security and cloud computing. Solutions can be deployed on public cloud services, in private data centers, or on a hybrid platform incorporating a combination of public and private tools.
If you're playing Buzzword Bingo at home, congratulations on the quick victory I just handed out. But Barracuda's hybrid cloud security is more than just hot air, and that strategy should keep the company relevant for years to come. Opportunistic investors might want to pick up a few shares while the guidance-related discounts last.

With the market at an all-time high, eight full years into what's been one of the longest bull markets in history, having a few value stocks in one's portfolio might just be more important than ever -- particularly for retirees. More specifically, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM), Philips 66 (NYSE:PSX), and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) appear to be interesting choices.
Three of our Fools break down the details on these great picks to get retirees -- or any investor digging for value in today's sky-high stock market -- started today. 

Image Source: Getty Images. 

Turning agricultural products into gold
Sean O'Reilly (Archer Daniels Midland): My pick for the ideal value stock as part of a retirement portfolio, Archer Daniels Midland, has a great deal to offer any Foolish investor. It boasts a forward P/E ratio of just 15, and earnings per share are expected to grow to $3.37 on average by fiscal 2020, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company is a bastion of value in a world where the forward P/E ratio of the S&P 500 index is 24.
Founded in 1898 as a milling company in Minneapolis, Archer Daniels Midland is an agricultural-products powerhouse. Today, it's a modern commodity operator, offering everything from oilseeds, corn, and rice for food manufacturing to ingredients for animal feed and cotton pulp for paper manufacturing. The company made a big move with its $3 billion acquisition of German natural-ingredients company Wild Flavors in 2014, pushing itself further into the increasingly important business of natural flavors, proteins, and health products.
The company is a prime example of sound financial management and execution. It generated $957 million of free cash flow in the 12 months ended March 31, up significantly from $593 million in fiscal 2016. In the company's Q1 earnings press release, CEO Juan Luciano touched on the reason for the improvement:

We are continuing to execute the long-term strategic plan that we launched in 2012, and we are seeing the results. We have strengthened our core, improving our cost positions and implementing measures to improve results where necessary. Our operational-excellence initiatives have delivered significant savings and efficiencies. And we continue to grow strategically by expanding into new geographies and increasing our capabilities in food, beverage, and feed. Those actions contributed to the improved results we saw in the first quarter despite muted margin environments in some businesses. The continued momentum in the execution of our plan gives us confidence that we will deliver sustainable value creation.

This is a rock-solid business sporting a low valuation compared with the rest of the market, all while it generates plenty of cash to do things like expand the business and maintain its healthy 3% dividend yield. For retired value investors, there's a lot to love.
A cheap dividend growth stock hiding in plain sight
Jason Hall (Phillips 66): Shares of Phillips 66 are trading a little above one-year lows, down more than 10% since the start of the year. At the same time, the company has seen its earnings fall sharply over the past couple of years, as refining margins have been squeezed by falling crude prices around the world. This situation has the company trading at more than 24 times the past year's earnings, a number that's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination.
But now's a bad time to evaluate Phillips 66 based on last year's earnings -- especially after the results the company posted to start the year. Not only was this a solid quarter for the company's refining business, which reported a near tripling of its profits year over year, but the midstream and chemicals segments also reported profit growth on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. All told, quarterly profit increased 40% year over year, and 267% sequentially. With the growth of its midstream and chemicals segments combining with an expected bounce-back in refinings, full-year profits are on track to come in well above last year's levels, and that makes Phillips 66 cheap, trading at 12 times projected 2017 earnings. 
Furthermore, the company's management is relentlessly focused on using cash flow growth to fund regular dividend increases. The company just announced an 11% dividend raise, putting the yield at 3.6% at recent prices. Since 2012, the company has increased its dividend 350%. 
Put it all together, and Phillips 66 is a dividend growth stock at a bargain price. That's ideal for retirement investors.

Trust the best in the world to help you beat the market
Steve Symington (Berkshire Hathaway): Normally I favor dividend-paying stocks for retired investors, so it might be a surprise that I'm arguing for Berkshire Hathaway as a compelling buy. As fellow Fool Matthew Frankel pointed out recently, though renowned value investor and Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett loves to pack his company's enviable portfolio full of generous dividend payers, he has famously shunned the prospect of his company paying a dividend. Instead, Buffett has consistently demonstrated his unrivaled ability to compound shareholder value by reinvesting in Berkshire's existing businesses, acquiring new businesses, or buying back Berkshire Hathaway shares. On the latter, Buffett has historically preferred to buy back shares only if Berkshire Hathaway stock falls below 1.2 times book value -- an exceedingly attractive price for a business of this caliber.
But at Berkshire's recent annual shareholder meeting, Buffett surprised investors by hinting that the company may consider initiating a dividend if it can't find a better way to put some of its roughly $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasury bills to work. In addition, Berkshire is looking at whether to raise its acceptable buyback floor to a slightly higher but still attractive level. Either way, trying to find the best way to put all of Berkshire Hathaway's money to work is an enviable problem to have. And with Berkshire Hathaway stock currently trading at a reasonable 1.37 times book value as of this writing, I think retired investors would do well to pick up shares and trust Warren Buffett to extend his market-beating ways.

As we head toward the Memorial Day holiday, many of the companies listed on the stock market will take a breather, too... at least as far as dividend raises are concerned. With the approach of summer, we're moving away from the latest earnings season, and there were relatively few payout hikes last week.
That doesn't mean the scene was idle, though. A clutch of companies declared higher distributions, including the following three notables.

Southwest Airlines
One of the more popular air carrier stocks on the market, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), is propelling its quarterly dividend 25% higher, to almost $0.13 per share. Additionally, the company's board authorized a new, $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, which replaces an expired initiative at the same amount.
At first, these moves might seem counterintuitive. On the face of it, Southwest's first quarter wasn't anything to jump in the air about, with revenue edging up only 1%, against costs that rose by nearly 9%. On the bottom line, adjusted net profit dove by 35%. Neither adjusted earnings ($372 million, or $0.61 per share) nor revenue (nearly $4.9 billion) hit the average analyst estimate.
Yet there was plenty to be cheered about in those results, not least of which was the company's high net margin -- no easy feat in an industry with persistently high costs. Another positive was that Southwest notched a new all-time high for first-quarter operating profit, at over $1.6 billion. That's almost triple what the company shelled out for dividends and share buybacks during the period. This bodes very well for the future of its payout.

LUV Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts.
Southwest's new dividend is to be dispensed on June 28 to stockholders of record as of June 7. At the most recent closing share price, it would yield 0.8%. That's well under the current 1.9% average yield of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500.
The carrier did not give an end date for its new share buyback program.
Northrop Grumman
Veteran aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), as per its once-a-year habit, has raised its quarterly dividend -- by 11% to $0.90 per share. The company didn't hesitate to mention that this represents the 14th straight year it has improved its payout.

NOC Dividend data by YCharts.
In contrast to fellow airborne stock Southwest Airlines, Northrop Grumman blew the market away with its first-quarter results. There was very little not to like: Sales were a sturdy 5% higher on a year-over-year basis, while net profit grew a very encouraging 15%. Both line items ($6.3 billion and $640 million, respectively) thrashed analyst estimates.
The world needs the kind of products made by Northrop Grumman and its peers; witness the recent series of arms deals signed by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states with the U.S. that will amount to roughly $350 billion. The immediate future looks quite good for the defense industry.
One slightly worrying development for Northrop Grumman in that otherwise stellar first quarter is operating cash flow -- high consumption plunged that line item into the red, to the tune of $439 million. The company should right that aircraft, though; it's sticking with its projections of a $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion surplus for this fiscal year. This should be sufficient to cover the company's dividend, and a shareholder-pleasing level of share buybacks.
Northrop Grumman will pay its next dividend on June 21 to investors of record as of June 5. It yields a theoretical 1.4% on the current share price.

            });
        

KeyCorp
KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), one of the numerous regional banking groups doing its thing in smaller markets, is bumping its quarterly dividend $0.01 (or 12%) higher to just under $0.10 per share.
KeyCorp is a bulkier entity than it used to be thanks to the company's acquisition of fellow regional First Niagara, in a $4 billion deal that was consummated last July. This helped KeyCorp increase its total revenue by 44%, net interest income by 52%, and per-share adjusted net income by 33%. The latter, by the way, topped analyst estimates -- the third quarter in a row the bank has achieved this feat.
KeyCorp has done a fine job expanding from its core Rust Belt operations. The First Niagara deal in particular gives it a presence in complementary Northeast markets, particularly upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. Due to synergies, it should also save money -- KeyCorp is on pace to cut annual expenses by around $450 million, up from an initial estimate of $400 million.
Which, of course, potentially means a significant bulge in the company's coffers. Last year, the bank managed to grow its free cash flow by almost 70% to $1.4 billion, and with the bulked-up operations and lower expenses, there's probably more where that came from. Last year's pile easily covered both dividend payouts and share buybacks, and I can't imagine that dynamic will change anytime soon.

KEY Free Cash Flow (Annual) data by YCharts.
KeyCorp's upcoming distribution is to be paid on June 15 to shareholders of record as of May 30. At the company's most recent closing stock price, it would yield 2.1%.

As for individual stocks, Trivago (NASDAQ:TRVG) and Forterra (NASDAQ:FRTA) made big moves following the companies' quarterly earnings reports.
Trivago takes a trip
Shares of Germany-based online hotel searching platform Trivago gained nearly 12% following quarterly results that showed a 68% spike in revenue even as the company expanded profitability. Wall Street applauded a 60% jump in shopper traffic that was enhanced by improved efficiency in translating hotel browsers into buyers. In addition, Trivago benefited from surging demand from hotel advertisers, particularly those targeting mobile shoppers.

Adjusted earnings rose to 7.2% of sales from 4.8% a year ago, and that boost helped the company book positive net earnings after three straight quarters of losses. In an investor presentation, management explained that a portion of its efficiency gain might be a temporary effect of advertisers optimizing their bidding strategies to perform better with Trivago's new display platform. ""We expect that ... these positive revenue effects will be partially mitigated over time,"" management noted.
However, most of the gains will likely stick around. ""The improvements in profitability were principally driven by the scaling of the business and our continuous improvements of our technology and algorithms, which we expect to continue to benefit from in the future,"" Chief Financial Officer Axel Hefer said. Trivago's full-year forecast calls for revenue growth of roughly 50% as profit margins rise slightly.

Forterra springs a leak
Forterra stock plunged over 24% after the drainage and water pipe specialist posted surprisingly weak first-quarter results and issued soft guidance for the current quarter. Net sales excluding acquisitions declined to $175.3 million from $187 million, which the company blamed on several factors, including project delays, lower selling prices, and unfavorable weather as compared to the year-ago period. Gross profit margin slumped to 11.5% of sales from 19% a year ago, mainly due to increased competition in its key Houston market. That drop combined with spiking costs on labor, freight, raw materials, and property to generate a net loss of $22.5 million compared to a loss of $3.9 million a year ago.
""Our financial performance is disappointing this quarter,"" CEO Jeff Bradley said in a press release, ""but we do not believe it is representative of the long-term strength of our business and our competitive position in the industry.""
Bradley and his team do think the same negative trends that pinched results this quarter will impact the second quarter, and so they lowered their Q2 forecast on both the top and bottom lines. Forterra aims to return to healthier growth beginning in the third quarter when it begins rolling out price increases. Executives hope demand will be more robust by then. Otherwise, the hikes could add even more pressure to Forterra's sales growth outlook.

For years, workers have been warned to save independently for retirement rather than rely on Social Security alone to pay the bills. While Social Security should replace a good 40% of your pre-retirement income, most people need at least 70% to 80% of their former earnings to stay afloat financially once they stop working. And new data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute tells us that in the early years of retirement, nearly 50% of households wind up spending more money, not less, than they did during their working years.
If your goal is to sustain a comfortable lifestyle in retirement, then you'll need to make a solid effort to save as much money as you can, as early as you can. But if you don't invest your savings wisely, you'll risk coming up short.

Getting aggressive pays off
The beauty of tax-deferred retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s is the ability to grow your savings without having to pay taxes on your investment gains year after year. This allows you to reinvest those gains in full and take full advantage of compounding. The problem, however, is that most Americans are saving too conservatively for retirement and limiting their investments' growth in the process.
According to a 2016 Wells Fargo study, 60% of savers in their 30s, 40s, and 50s are so focused on minimizing losses that they're not capitalizing on growth opportunities. Or, to put it another way, more people than not are shying away from stocks at a time in their lives when that added growth could have a huge long-term impact.
Of course, the risky nature of stocks has long been a considerable barrier to entry for otherwise cautious investors. And it makes sense. Stocks are among the most volatile investments out there, and if you're the risk-averse type, you're probably inclined to put your money elsewhere. But there's an upside to taking on the risk of stock investments, and it's the higher returns they're known to deliver. In fact, if you load up your portfolio with stocks, you might easily see double the return a bond-focused strategy would give you. And that could spell the difference between a comfortable retirement and one that's wrought with financial stress.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-84389');
            });
        


To illustrate this point further, take a look at the following table, which outlines the type of return your investment style is likely to yield and its impact on your ultimate savings balance:

TABLE BY AUTHOR. *ASSUMES A $500 MONTHLY INVESTMENT.
If you commit to saving $500 a month during your career and adopt an aggressive investment strategy, you stand to accumulate $680,000 in time for retirement -- a more than respectable nest egg. But if you limit yourself to conservative investments, you might end up with less than half that amount. And that forgone $344,000 is money you'll no doubt come to miss once you're retired and heavily reliant on savings to pay the bills.
Don't fear the stock market
Nobody wants to work hard and make sacrifices to save money only to lose a chunk of it in the stock market. But if you're willing to adopt a long-term investment strategy, which should be the case when saving for retirement, then you stand a strong chance of coming out ahead.

Consider this: Between 1965 and 2015, the S&P 500 underwent 27 corrections of 10% or more, but it ultimately recovered from each and every one. Now if patience isn't your most promising virtue, and you're the type who's inclined to act impulsively and pull out your investments the second they start to dip in value, then yes, you might lose out in the stock market. But if history tells us anything, it's that those who commit to sticking things out for the long-haul wind up making money -- sometimes lots of money -- from stocks.
If the idea of investing in individual stocks sounds daunting, then there's always the option to buy shares of an index fund. Index funds are a simple, low-cost alternative for getting a piece of the stock market action, and they offer the benefit of instant diversification. Both the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO) and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEMKT:VTI) offer decent stock exposure for newbies.
It's easy enough to adopt a conservative investment strategy and resign yourself to limited growth, but that's a move that can really hurt you in the long run. While investing in stocks might push you outside your comfort zone, when you think about it, the alternative -- not having enough money in retirement -- is actually a far more frightening prospect.

With the bullishness of the Trump era, dividend stocks may have moved to the back seat for a lot of investors. While cyclicals and financials have been big winners, defensive, dividend-paying stocks have lagged behind. 
Still, that provides a good opportunity to pick up some solid dividend stocks at relatively low prices. Dividend Aristocrats are perennial investor favorites. These are S&P 500 stocks that have hiked their payouts every year for 25 years or more. The exclusive status is a testament to their ability to generate consistent earnings growth, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.

Image source: Getty Images.

In today's market, here are three Dividend Aristocrats that look set to deliver continuing growth.
1. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 
In the last few years, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been a surprising turnaround story. The world's largest retailer was losing sales to Amazon.com and a host of other rivals, with comparable sales falling as recently as 2014. Under CEO Doug McMillon, the company has stepped up investments in wages and cleaning up stores to improve customer satisfaction, which has led to ten straight quarters of comparable sales increases.
The company has also invested in e-commerce, expanding its online grocery pickup service to hundreds of stores and purchasing Jet.com for $3.3 billion last summer and a few smaller online retailers earlier this year. While the company's shares are near a two-year high, profits have suffered due to those investments -- they have declined over the last two years, and are expected to remain flat this year.
Dividend growth has also been slow, as Wal-Mart has lifted its dividend just a penny per quarter in the last four years. However, that could change once profit growth returns, which is expected next year. Either way, Wal-Mart is stronger than it's been in years, and is leveraging its size and competitive advantages once again. While Amazon and the changing retail landscape still present a threat, Wal-Mart is quickly closing the gap.
2. Lowe's Companies 
Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) has been among the best retail performers since the recession. The home improvement specialist has ridden the housing recovery, and its stock has nearly tripled in value.
Same-stores have grown consistently, and the home improvement sector is protected from e-commerce and much of the forces that threatening other parts of the retail industry. Lowe's record as a Dividend Aristocrat is also encouraging: the company has hiked its dividend payout every year for 54 years. The last time it hiked its dividend payout it raised it 25% to $0.35 a quarter last year, and the company will raise it again in the coming months.
Lowe's payout ratio, or the percentage of earnings that go to its dividend payout, remains modest at 36%, meaning the company should be able to continue raising its dividend for many more years even if earnings growth doesn't quite keep up.
But the good news for Lowe's shareholders is that the housing market remains strong and other trends such as millennials' preference for spending on home improvements also seem to favor it over the long term.  Earnings per share is set to increase 16% to $4.64 this year, auguring another meaty dividend hike.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-74435');
            });
        

3. Sherwin-Williams
Another home-improvement retailer worth a closer look is Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), the paint manufacturer and retailer. Founded 150 years ago, the company has been around longer than almost any other S&P 500 stock, and has grown thanks to a combination of steady organic sales growth and savvy acquisitions. 
Like Lowe's, the stock has nearly tripled over the last few years as the company has benefited from the improving housing market and grown through acquisitions like Comex and Valspar, the latter of which is expected to close later this year. 
In the company's most recent quarter, comparable sales jumped 7.5%, and management expects earnings per share to increase 10% for the full year.
The paint specialist has raised its dividend for 37 years in a row, and, though it only raised it by a penny last year as it may have been saving money for the Valspar acquisition, it hiked its dividend by more than 20% in the two years prior. Sherwin-Williams has a payout ratio of just 26%, but only offers a yield of 1%. Still, with the strength in the housing market and the power of a 150-year-old brand name, the stock should continue to outperform.

Not all large-capitalization stocks are boring and stodgy: far from it. For investors who know what to look for, many of the world's premier large-cap companies have unique situations brewing that could prove extremely profitable for owners of their shares.
To get Foolish investors started, we asked three of The Motley Fool's contributing writers to offer up their best picks for savvy investors in the large-capitalization space. In response, they identified General Electric (NYSE:GE), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). Read on for all the key details.

Image source: Getty Images.

Sean O'Reilly (General Electric): There's something big going on over at General Electric, which is why it's my pick as a large-cap stock. GE is the quintessential industrial conglomerate. Founded over 100 years ago, it has its hands in a multitude of sectors, including gas and steam power systems through its power segment, wind-turbine manufacturing through its renewable energy segment, and aircraft engines through its aviation segment. Its energy connections and lighting segment offers power conversion solutions to both industrial and grid customers. And thanks to the acquisition of a majority stake in Baker Hughes, GE is now one of the world's largest players in oil and gas services.
GE is a true large-capitalization stock, currently valued at approximately $240 billion. The first thing investors should know about GE is that it's almost done with its plan to drastically reduce its investments in its GE Capital subsidiary. This is a big deal because it frees up ree up billions of cash that can be reinvested in industrial operations, or returned to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. This is not only good because GE Capital has frequently been more trouble that it was worth (particularly during the 2008 financial crisis), but also because recent results in these operations have been solid: Organic revenues were up 7%, orders increased 10%, and industrial operating margins expanded 1.3% over the same quarter in fiscal year 2016. First-quarter earnings from ongoing operations (defined by GE as industrial plus verticals) came in at $0.21 per share, flat year over year, but a 12% gain once asset sale gains and restructuring charges are factored in.
All of this lends itself strongly to the idea that GE's future is bright, because the disposal of the vast majority of GE's financial assets, $198 billion at last count, means GE will no longer be deemed ""systemically important"" by regulators -- freeing up tons of cash. As was reiterated by management in their first-quarter conference call, GE will return somewhere between $19 billion and $21 billion to shareholders via buybacks and dividends this year alone.

Investors can expect these initiatives to bear fruit through the end of the decade, with analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence expecting earnings per share to grow from $1.63 this year to over $2.00 by fiscal year 2019. Strong EPS growth, and a renewed focus on what it does best make GE a solid pick for Foolish investors.
Big and getting bigger
Travis Hoium (Apple): The biggest company on the stock market is still a smart buy today. Yes, despite its $800 billion market cap, Apple is still a great value for investors, because it's a cash flow machine with no signs of stopping soon. You can see below that Apple's cash levels have exploded the last five years, even as it's been paying investors bigger and bigger dividends:

AAPL Cash and Equivalents (Quarterly) data by YCharts.

Apple hasn't lost its hold on the smartphone market and accompanying ecosystem. Customers who buy an iPhone, iPad, or Mac are quickly brought into an ecosystem that drives services revenue, which topped $7 billion last quarter alone, and makes owning other Apple products more attractive. And while new iPhones and other products bring excitement to the company, the ecosystem is what keeps Apple customers coming back time after time.
Even if Apple isn't the revolutionary company it was a decade ago, it can still use its immense cash flow to buy back shares and provide a great dividend. Those are qualities in a large-cap stock that investors should love, and they make Apple a great buy today.

The wind at its back
Brian Feroldi (Medtronic): The demand for high-quality healthcare is poised to rise considerably in the years ahead, thanks to steady growth in the global middle class. That should prove to be a meaningful tailwind for all companies that sell healthcare products like medical devices. That's why I believe that Medtronic is a great large-cap stock for investors to take a look at today.
Medtronic is a highly diversified medical-device maker that has its hand in a number of healthcare markets. The company has a long history of buying or building innovative products that treat a range of diseases. Currently, Medtronic's business is broken down into four segments -- diabetes, cardiac and vascular, minimally invasive, and restorative therapies. The company sells hundreds of individual products across these four categories around the world.
One big benefit of this extreme diversification is that the company's financial statements are remarkably resilient to the competitive landscape or changes in the global economy. That has allowed Medtronic's financial statements to flourish even when a few of its business segments are under pressure.
Medtronic's financial resiliency has worked out beautifully for long-term shareholders. The company now boasts a 39-year history of increasing its dividend payment and regularly buying back stock. Those factors have helped the stock thump the S&P 500 over the last five years:

That has allowed Medtronic's financial statements to flourish even when a few of its business segments are under pressure.
Medtronic's financial resiliency has worked out beautifully for long-term shareholders. The company now boasts a 39-year history of increasing its dividend payment and regularly buying back stock. Those factors have helped the stock thump the S&P 500 over the last five years:

A few years ago, a start-up called GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) carved out a high-growth niche in the stagnant camera market with its Hero action cameras. Sales of those cameras surged until 2015, but started sliding after GoPro -- and a growing number of rival camera makers -- seemingly saturated the specialty market.

GoPro's annual revenue, 2013-2017. Data source: Quarterly reports, Analyst estimates.

Today's action-camera makers face two main challenges. First, smartphone cameras are good enough for many mainstream consumers, calling into question the need for stand-alone action cameras. Second, intense price competition and hardware commoditization are driving prices down.
To counter those headwinds, manufacturers are developing next-generation cameras for capturing 360-degree content. These panoramic videos can be viewed by swiping through a video, moving the mobile device, or wearing a virtual reality headset. These ""niche within a niche"" devices include Samsung's Gear 360, Ricoh's Theta, Kodak's PixPro SP360, and GoPro's upcoming Fusion.
Despite the recent speed bumps, the action-camera market could still keep growing. Research firm Global Market Insights expects the size of the global action camera market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than 22% between 2016 and 2023 -- so companies like GoPro could still have room to run.

Invest in a business a fool can run because someday, a fool will.
The above quote isn't one of my favorites from legendary investor, Warren Buffett. The CEO of a company sets the tone, drives the culture, and guides the strategy of a business. Having a fool (lowercase ""f"") at the helm can often steer the company in the wrong direction. Nevertheless, I do believe that Buffett was referring more to the importance of a strong business model rather than discounting leadership entirely. After all, many of his acquisitions at Berkshire Hathaway occurred with the caveat that current management remain in place.
When beginning to research a business for the first time, I typically start by analyzing the strength of its leadership team. Poring over financial statements is one way to judge a management team. However, many aspects of the job are intangible and can be difficult to judge. So how does an investor evaluate a strong CEO and executive team?
Although not an exhaustive list, I like to start by looking at three factors -- experience, employee satisfaction, and whether executives and shareholders are tied at the hip in terms of compensation. Let's see where Accenture (NYSE:ACN) falls within this framework.
An experienced management team

Image source: Accenture.https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/blog-pierre-equal-makes-us-greater-than

Pierre Nanterme has led Accenture since January 2011 (he is also the company chairman). Although he has only been in the corner office for about six years, Pierre is a 33-year veteran of the company, holding various leadership roles during this time. Investors have had plenty to cheer the past six years, as the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 handily.

Data by YCharts.

During his tenure, Accenture has increased revenue and free cash flow at an annualized rate of 27% and 34%, respectively. The company's strong performance has led to Nanterme's being named Fortune's ""Businessperson of the Year"" in 2015. He was also on Harvard Business Review's 2016 list of ""Best-Performing CEOs in the World.""
For a company with over 400,000 employees and operations that span 55 countries, a CEO is highly dependent on his or her lieutenants. At Accenture, that group appears to be equally capable. The average tenure of its 13-person executive team is 28 years. Only one executive has been with the company less than 10 years. Normally, I would be turned away from a company with a management team with so many miles under their belts. However, the average age of the executives is under 54, with a long way to go before retirement. This is telling in that most of the executive team has stuck with the company since they were in their 20s, likely just coming out of graduate school. The company promotes from within, and Accenture's culture is ingrained in its management.
The right incentives
Although I might disagree with Buffett on the value of leadership, I am a big believer in his partner Charlie Munger's thoughts on the power of incentives:

I think I've been in the top 5% of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I've underestimated it.

Incentives are a powerful driver of human behavior, which is why I believe it's one of the most important metrics when analyzing leadership. According to company filings for fiscal 2016, Nanterme's compensation was 74% long-term equity incentives, 16% annual cash bonus, 5% base salary, and 5% one-time discretionary cash bonus. As for the entire executive team, a significant portion of their compensation is tied to meeting performance objectives over a three-year period. The metrics on which the executive team is judged are as follows:

Broad-based revenue growth
Sustained margin expansion
Strong earnings growth
Cash returned to shareholders

I wouldn't mind seeing part of the compensation tied to free cash flow growth rather than earnings growth, as earnings can often be manipulated. Otherwise, the executive compensation plan for the company strongly aligns with shareholders' interest. Another item to note is that insider ownership made up only 0.21% of all shares outstanding. But as of March 28, the CEO did own over $30 million in Accenture stock.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-10680');
            });
        

Employee satisfaction
According to a study by the London Business School, companies with high employee satisfaction outperformed their peers by 2.3% to 3.8% per year over a 28-year time horizon. The results also suggest that it's employee satisfaction that drives good performance, rather than the other way around.
In 2017, Accenture was ranked #88 in Fortune's list of ""100 Best Companies to Work For"" -- this marked the ninth year the company has been featured on the list. And according to data from Glassdoor, 82% of respondents would recommend the company to a friend, while 94% approve of the CEO. The overall employee rating of the company is also trending upwards. While Glassdoor data can sometimes be distorted by small sample sizes, Accenture has 24,000 reviews. Here is a glimpse of professional life at the company.

Image source: Glassdoor.

The importance of employee satisfaction is not lost on management. In fact, Mr. Nanterme was once the company's Chief Leadership Officer, putting him in charge of developing the company's leadership program. And his investments in leadership have continued since becoming CEO -- the company spent $941 million in 2016 on training and professional development, a 12% increase from fiscal 2015.
As the stock has more than doubled in price over the last five years, Accenture shareholders have been treated well. With a strong and experienced leadership team, an economically aligned compensation program, and happy employees, it appears the foundation for strong future returns is also in place.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/21/3-things-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-this-week.aspx,2017-05-21,"
Stocks partially recovered from a sizable one-day drop last week to end up with just minor declines. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) indexes shed less than 0.5% and remain up about 5% year to date.

Data by YCharts.
Earnings season promises to continue producing volatility for investors over the week ahead. A few of the most anticipated reports set to be released include those from Tiffany (NYSE:TIF), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA).
Tiffany's profit margin
Tiffany shares have rebounded lately, after the luxury retailer posted decent quarterly results in March and predicted a return to sales growth in fiscal 2017. Sure, sales dropped 3% worldwide over the holiday season because of what management described as softness across all its jewelry categories, but the combination of falling costs and rising prices helped push gross margin up nearly two percentage points to 62% of sales, protecting bottom-line profitability.
Executives aren't expecting general selling conditions to improve much in the new fiscal year, but the company does believe sales growth will return in 2017 following two straight years of declines. A roughly 9% increase in earnings, meanwhile, would put the company within striking distance of the $484 million it earned in 2015, its most profitable year on record. 
Costco's customer traffic
Costco will announce its fiscal third-quarter numbers on Thursday, just before the company delivers a $3.1 billion special dividend, equating to $7 per share. The warehouse giant's stock has kept pace with the market over the past year through major operating challenges, including grocery price deflation and a sharp slowdown in customer traffic growth. Comparable-store sales are up 2% over the past six months, compared with 4% in 2016 and better than 6% in each of the prior five fiscal years. 

Image source: Costco.

Investors will be watching how comps play out but will likely pay more attention to Costco's membership trends. Renewal rates and membership fees were weaker than expected over the past few quarters due mainly to its shift to a new co-branded credit card. But now that the changeover is behind it, and with membership prices slated to rise on its huge subscriber base, fee income should rebound. Management is hoping that its renewal rates improve, or at least hold steady, even as the price of a Costco membership rises.

Ulta Beauty's 2017 forecast
Ulta Beauty has had no problem booking healthy sales gains even as customer traffic slows in the broader retail industry. In fact, the spa and beauty specialist's comps trounced management estimates last quarter by rising 16.6% to a near record high. Ulta enjoyed an 11% increase in shopper traffic and a 6% jump in average spending per visit last quarter.

CEO Mary Dillon and her team forecast a 10% comps gain in the first quarter. While that would mark a sharp slowdown from prior periods, it would still edge past their long-term guidance projecting 8% annual gains in fiscal 2017 through 2019.
Investors should also watch for the e-commerce business to contribute a growing portion of sales gains over time. And as long as comps remain at or near management's long-term targets, Ulta's store expansion plans are likely to stay aggressive. The company aims to add 100 new locations to its base this year.

",3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/24/3-cheap-stocks-you-can-buy-right-now.aspx,2017-05-24,"
There's little question that the stock market is currently expensive. The S&P 500 sports a price-to-earnings ratio in the mid-20s, well above its historical average, and many high-quality stocks trade for even loftier multiples. Cheap stocks in this environment are few and far between.
But if you look hard enough, there are still some bargains to be found. Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA), and Chicago Bridge & Iron (NYSE:CBI) are all trading at depressed valuations. All three stocks come with significant risks, and all three could burn you if things go wrong. But there's plenty of upside if the worst-case scenarios fail to play out.

Image source: Getty Images.

A retailer with a big problem
Bed Bath & Beyond is doing better than many other retailers. Fourth-quarter comparable sales grew by 0.4%, driven by 20% growth in online sales. The stores suffered a low single-digit decline, but an overall increase in sales makes Bed Bath & Beyond's results look stellar compared to some parts of the retail sector, particularly department stores.
The bottom line, however, is different story. As Bed Bath & Beyond shifts sales online, and as it continues to send out an unending stream of its ubiquitous ""20% off"" coupons, margins are taking a hit. Both gross and operating margins have been in decline since 2012, and net income has slumped by 34% from its peak. Share buybacks have boosted per-share earnings, but the company expects EPS to fall by as much as 10% in 2017.

BBBY data by YCharts.
Slumping earnings have dragged down the stock price, creating an interesting situation for investors looking for cheap stocks. Assuming EPS does fall by 10%, the stock currently trades for just 8.5 times forward earnings. The market is betting that things keep getting worse, and they very well may. But if Bed Bath & Beyond can stabilize the bottom line, that valuation will look overly pessimistic in retrospect. There's significant risk here, especially if sales begin to decline. But the valuation makes opening a small position tempting.
A small, cheap tech company
Acacia Communications makes optical interconnect products, counting cloud infrastructure providers and communication service providers as customers. Like with any small tech company, predicting the future is next to impossible. But Acacia has enjoyed both strong growth and impressive profitability over the past few years, and the stock is priced at what looks like a pessimistic level.

ACIA data by YCharts.
Shares of Acacia are down about 60% from their peak, and they recently took a big hit when the company guided for a significant revenue decline during the second quarter. The culprit is weak demand in China, which is affecting not only Acacia but the entire industry. The company expects this to be a temporary slowdown, with growth returning during the second half.
Acacia's market capitalization is now around $1.85 billion, about 15 times last year's adjusted earnings and 22 times analyst estimates for 2017 adjusted earnings. If the China slowdown turns out to be truly temporary, the stock could soar as the company returns to revenue and earnings growth in 2018. But if weak demand persists for longer than expected, the stock could tumble further. If a cheap small-cap tech stock is what you're after, Acacia is one to consider.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-26554');
            });
        

A beaten-down, century-old company
Shares of Chicago Bridge & Iron, a century-old engineering and construction company, have been hammered over the past few years. The stock is down a whopping 77% from its peak in early 2014, driven by a couple of factors. First, an ongoing legal dispute between CB&I and Westinghouse over CB&I's sale of its nuclear construction business could cost the company billions of dollars. Second, weak demand for its services, particularly in the energy sector, has led to slumping revenue and profits.

CBI data by YCharts.
Revenue tumbled 17.4% in 2016, and CB&I reported a $313 million net loss, its second consecutive year of losses. Adjusted net income was $438 million last year, with the discrepancy due to various charges related to cost-to-complete estimates for its projects. The company expects to produce adjusted EPS between $3.50 and $4.00 in 2017, putting the stock price at just 5.4 times the midpoint of that range.
The Westinghouse lawsuit creates a lot of uncertainty, especially since CB&I's market capitalization is now just $2 billion, the same amount Westinghouse claims it's owed. On top of that, the company will need to turn its business around and return to earnings growth. A new CEO is taking the helm on July 1, with a challenging task ahead.
If the lawsuit doesn't go terribly wrong for CB&I, the stock could soar due to its beaten-down valuation alone. There's a lot of uncertainly and a lot of risk, but a single-digit earnings multiple should put the stock on your radar.

The agricultural market has been hit hard in recent years. A confluence of factors, ranging from oversupply in North America to crop-destroying floods and droughts in South America, have kept a lid on growth for the industry's leading companies. Ingredion (NYSE:INGR), which focuses on selling corn-based sweeteners and texturing ingredients to food and beverage industries, hasn't been spared. From 2014 to 2016, the ingredients leader reported full-year revenue of $5.67 billion, $5.62 billion, and $5.7 billion. 
The good news is that the stock has performed remarkably well in that span, easily beating the total returns of the S&P 500. Why? Ingredion has begun traveling the well-worn path of other mature businesses. That is, the company has grown EPS and cash flow by focusing on optimizing existing operations, rather than prioritizing top line growth. Management expects that to continue this year -- along with a mix of growth investments. A look at initiatives under way hint at what's next for investors. 

Image source: Getty Images.

The path to a cash cow
Investors seeking out a stable company with reliable earnings and cash generation may want to consider giving Ingredion a hard look. It provides a range of ingredients that are valuable to many diverse industries. Customers reside in food, beverage, animal nutrition, paper manufacturing, brewing, and several other markets. The company classifies the products it sells into three categories: 




Product Type

Description

% of 2016 Sales





Starch ingredients


Corn starches are in most foods you eat because of their broad applications, from adhesion to fat replacement to texturing.


46%




Sweeteners


Most ingredients in this group are sugar-containing syrups, such as high fructose corn syrup, but several sugar-free sweeteners are available, too.


37%




Co-products


Byproducts from corn processing are sold to animal feed markets and even to become salad dressings and cooking oil.


17%





Data source: SEC filings. 
Yet while Ingredion has made itself valuable to various customers, it has struggled to grow revenue in recent years. Thus, it has doubled down on a popular strategy for ""creating shareholder value"", as nearly every company that follows it explains. This includes reigning in unnecessary costs, investing in margin expansion over revenue growth, and initiating a share buyback program. The moves are aimed at increasing EPS and cash flow, even if the top line fails to grow very much.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-40122');
            });
        


Investors can't exactly be upset with the strategy. Full-year 2016 results demonstrated that it is in fact working.

Additionally, share count has already been reduced 1.1% since the end of last year, which will further boost EPS. 
Of course, there is only so much fat that can be cut out of operations, which have a limit to the efficiency they can achieve. There's no way of knowing if the company is nearing that threshold, but it stands to reason that the party will end eventually. What happens then?

Management's strategy for tapping into long-term growth opportunities centers mostly on increasing the share of high-margin specialty ingredients that respond to food industry trends, such as consumer demands for ""clean labels"" and ""natural"" ingredients. Today these are grouped within the starch and sweetener product categories, but specialty ingredients would have accounted for 26% of total sales in 2016 had they been reported separately. That's up from 24% in 2014. 

INGR Total Return Price data by YCharts
The growth in specialty ingredients is important, especially since other starch and sweetener products are falling out of favor (hello, stevia). Ingredion is currently expanding its portfolio through acquisitions, including that of TIC Gums in late December, although it may be missing out on larger and longer-term opportunities presented by industrial biotech. Either way, the last three acquisitions were specifically geared toward specialty ingredients, which again shows the priorities of management when using cash if it has to.
What's next for Ingredion investors?
Ingredion's mature business is becoming a cash cow, which should allow for much higher dividend payments or additional acquisitions, or perhaps a mix of both. A growing war chest in coming years could even allow it to rapidly play catch up on missed opportunities, such as in stevia ingredients or with innovative industrial biotech manufacturing platforms. It may take years to see a significant impact from increasing specialty ingredients sales that offset declines in other areas of the business, but the current strategy appears to put the company on solid long-term footing.

The agricultural market has been hit hard in recent years. A confluence of factors, ranging from oversupply in North America to crop-destroying floods and droughts in South America, have kept a lid on growth for the industry's leading companies. Ingredion (NYSE:INGR), which focuses on selling corn-based sweeteners and texturing ingredients to food and beverage industries, hasn't been spared. From 2014 to 2016, the ingredients leader reported full-year revenue of $5.67 billion, $5.62 billion, and $5.7 billion. 
The good news is that the stock has performed remarkably well in that span, easily beating the total returns of the S&P 500. Why? Ingredion has begun traveling the well-worn path of other mature businesses. That is, the company has grown EPS and cash flow by focusing on optimizing existing operations, rather than prioritizing top line growth. Management expects that to continue this year -- along with a mix of growth investments. A look at initiatives under way hint at what's next for investors.

The path to a cash cow
Investors seeking out a stable company with reliable earnings and cash generation may want to consider giving Ingredion a hard look. It provides a range of ingredients that are valuable to many diverse industries. Customers reside in food, beverage, animal nutrition, paper manufacturing, brewing, and several other markets. The company classifies the products it sells into three categories: 




Product Type

Description

% of 2016 Sales





Starch ingredients


Corn starches are in most foods you eat because of their broad applications, from adhesion to fat replacement to texturing.


46%




Sweeteners


Most ingredients in this group are sugar-containing syrups, such as high fructose corn syrup, but several sugar-free sweeteners are available, too.


37%




Co-products


Byproducts from corn processing are sold to animal feed markets and even to become salad dressings and cooking oil.


17%





Data source: SEC filings. 
Yet while Ingredion has made itself valuable to various customers, it has struggled to grow revenue in recent years. Thus, it has doubled down on a popular strategy for ""creating shareholder value"", as nearly every company that follows it explains. This includes reigning in unnecessary costs, investing in margin expansion over revenue growth, and initiating a share buyback program. The moves are aimed at increasing EPS and cash flow, even if the top line fails to grow very much.

In just the last six months, the S&P 500 has gained 10%, and while a rising tide usually lifts all boats, there are some companies that haven't done as well. In fact, it's as though they're holding on to the anchor and sinking fast.
Below, I'll take a look at why Fossil (NASDAQ:FOSL), Hertz (NYSE:HTZ), and J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) have not only seen their stocks decline, but have lost half their value or more. These stocks have sprung serious leaks suggesting there is something very wrong with their operations. So read on to find out what challenges are besetting these companies.

Image source: Fossil.

Fossil
Watchmaker Fossil is caught in the vortex of two forces that threaten to rip it apart: the decline of brick-and-mortar retail and the move away from traditional timepieces toward smartwatches. The centrifugal forces have sent Fossil's stock careening 58% lower in the last six months.
Shoppers aren't going to the mall anymore. As e-commerce continues to grow, and particularly as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) provides one-stop shopping for virtually everything a consumer might need, a trip to the mall just isn't as necessary as it used to be. That's forcing retailers to shut hundreds of stores, and when one of these outlets closes, that's one less location where Fossil can sell its goods.
More concerning for the watchmaker is that it has completely missed the demand for smartwatches. You would think a company in this business would have seen the potential for the trend, but Fossil was very late in climbing on board. While it promised to make a big bet on technology and launched 100 wearables, that was more a desperate move than a carefully thought-out strategy. It has already lost substantial ground to Apple, Samsung, and Fitbit (even the latter was caught flat-footed by the preference for smartwatches as opposed to single-purpose fitness trackers). Now it's scrambling to catch up, which means any play Fossil makes is going to be simply a me-too item in a very crowded field.
Fossil's first-quarter results showed a 17% drop in sales in the Americas, generating a net loss of $1 a share, which was nearly four times worse than the $0.27-per-share loss Wall Street expected. Time does not appear to be on Fossil's side.

J.C. Penney
You can take the overview of retail troubles above and use it to explain what's causing J.C. Penney's woes. The department store chain was only just beginning to get its bearings after a near financial collapse a few years ago when retail's problems added instability.
Unlike the watchmaker, though, J.C. Penney's recent earnings results were slightly better than expected. While sales still fell year over year, and it posted a surprise adjusted profit of $0.06 per share, that was only the result of a one-time operating-asset sale. Customer traffic is down, and it looks like it will need to close hundreds of more stores to shore up its finances (that would hurt Fossil too, by the way, as it sells its watches in J.C. Penney's stores).
Management tried to remain upbeat about its prospects and said that while February was a lousy month for everyone in retail, J.C. Penney's March and April were much better in comparison. Investors weren't buying it, however, and caused its stock to drop nearly 25% in the days following the earnings report. The stock has lost its value since November.
Department stores like J.C. Penney and Macy's simply have too many stores. Because of the seismic shift in consumer shopping habits, the retailers need to dramatically shrink their footprint to be able to reflect decreasing demand, but the ripple effect such moves have only compounds the problems facing the chains.
Malls are turning into ghost towns once again, and investors in department stores like J.C. Penney should be scared for what that ultimately means.

Hertz
In a way, the problems at car rental giant Hertz aren't all that different from those afflicting Fossil and J.C. Penney in that it, too, needs to deal with changing consumer preferences. Hertz's issues, though, don't stem from the way people shop, but rather from how they get around. With the proliferation of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft making it easy for travelers to get a ride when and where they need it -- and at significantly lower cost -- the need to actually rent a car has diminished.
Moreover, Hertz is also confronted with depressed used-car pricing. A large part of Hertz's business (which applies to any car rental company, for that matter) is selling the used cars that are retired from its fleet every year. The growth in car leasing from the automakers has created a glut of used cars on the market that is pushing prices lower, and the National Automobile Dealers Association says its used-car pricing index remains at its lowest point since 2010.
Compounding the problem are Hertz's own turnaround efforts, which include changing over its rental fleet faster. It has been dumping many of the compact and standard sedans in its fleet in favor of more popular SUVs.
The transition is a double-edged sword because it means Hertz's business is taking a big hit up front, but it just might bolster the business later as it would allow the company to charge higher rates for vehicles.
Still, Hertz needs to contend with customers opting for a lift with the ride-sharing apps. Hertz has tried to minimize the damage by partnering with both Uber and Lyft to allow people to rent a car and then drive for the services, but that only seems to delay the day of reckoning.
Hertz is in the midst of an industry upheaval, though not necessarily one the company shouldn't eventually be able to drive through.

",3 Stocks That Have Been Cut in Half in the Last 6 Months
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/23/3-top-stocks-that-are-cash-cows.aspx,2017-05-23,"
Cash is king, especially when it comes to investing. Companies that are cash cows have more financial flexibility to create shareholder value through dividends or share repurchase programs, to make ground-shaking acquisitions that fuel long-term growth, and to reinvest in their most promising opportunities.
Companies with strong cash flow from operations, or CFO, may not be the fastest-growing stocks on the market, but they do offer great opportunities for long-term investors to corral the power of compound interest. Investors interested in owning stable businesses with leadership positions in their respective industries should put Ecolab (NYSE:ECL), Petrobras (NYSE:PBR), and American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK) on their investing radar.

Image source: Getty Images.

Slow and steady growth for the long haul
Ecolab is a great case study in the power of compound interest. The nearly $6 billion acquisition of Nalco in December 2011 transformed it into a leading water technologies company overnight. Even today, the acquisition continues to provide ample growth opportunities in industries as diverse as food and beverages, oil and gas drilling, and life sciences. Amazingly, despite relatively tame top-line growth in the years since, investors have enjoyed an explosion in CFO -- which has coincided with impressive stock gains in the past 10 years.

ECL Total Return Price data by YCharts
Consider that in 2012, the first full year after the Nalco acquisition, revenue and cash flow from operations totaled $11.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Last year those metrics grew to $13.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. While the top line has grown just 11% in that time, admittedly affected by a major slowdown in business from the energy sector, CFO has increased 58%.  
How did Ecolab achieve that? By focusing on cost efficiency and high-margin opportunities across various industries. The good news for investors is that the ride should continue for the foreseeable future. Management is guiding for a 10% increase in adjusted EPS (using the midpoint) in 2017 compared with last year, and the energy segment is only just beginning to regain its footing. It may be hard to believe, but barring an economic slowdown, growth and cash generation could accelerate in 2018. That could lead to growth-driving acquisitions in critical sub-segments identified by management, such as the newly created life-sciences unit. 
How do you say ""cash cow"" in Portuguese?
Petrobras, the state-owned oil giant from Brazil, has had a rough few years after being at the center of the political scandal that led to a major recession, the impeachment of a president, and increasing enforcement of austerity measures in South America's leading economy. The stock was rightly sold off en masse as investors worried about political, economic, and industry uncertainty, but through it all the company maintained an amazing level of operating cash flow. In fact, Petrobras now generates more cash from operations than better-known multinationals including BP, ExxonMobil, and Total SA.

PBR Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts
The industry-leading cash flow helped the stock gain 137% in 2016, as investors gained confidence in accelerated efforts to refocus the business on core segments and clean up the balance sheet. Strong cash flow will certainly be needed for the latter -- Petrobras ended the first quarter of 2017 with an astonishing $105 billion in debt. The good news is that figure is a major improvement from the even-more-astonishing previous level of debt, which peaked at $162 billion in 2015.
So, Petrobras has high levels of debt, a relatively moderate amount of uncertainty, and is doubling-down on expensive deepwater assets. Why should this cash cow be on your radar? Well, it seems that the market is far from fairly valuing the company assuming debt reduction levels are met. It's worth about half of BP and Total SA, and one-fifth of ExxonMobil.

PBR Market Cap data by YCharts
It also boasts the best price-to-book and EV-to-CFO ratios among the group.

PBR Price to Book Value data by YCharts
It definitely has a long way to go before it can return to previous levels of profitability -- or profitability at all -- but it's the closest it has been in years. If that's coupled with a long-term focus on maintaining more reasonable debt levels, then Petrobras could become a blue-chip oil stock in due time. Then again, in Brazil, nothing seems certain at the moment.

            });
        

Keeping the cash (and water) flowing
Similar to Ecolab, American Water Works Company is a poster child for the awesome power of compound interest. The stock has more than doubled the returns of the S&P 500 in the past decade when dividends are included for both, and it's also more than doubled CFO in that span. That's easy to do when your main task is to keep the water flowing to residential and industrial customers, even if year-over-year growth rarely breaks out of the mid-single digits.

AWK Total Return Price data by YCharts
The water service provider reported CFO of $1.28 billion last year, a 43% increase from 2013. Better yet, management has determined that one of the best uses of that cash is, simply, increasingly higher dividend payments. Shareholders now collect 41.5 cents per share each quarter, up sharply from quarterly payouts of $0.28 in 2013. The stock has nearly doubled in that time -- before accounting for dividends -- and the business sees no signs of stopping. It may just be one of the steadiest cash cows on the market for long-term investors. 
What does it mean for investors?
As these three stocks demonstrate that cash really is king. A strong cash flow from operations can power stock gains even when a major business segment gets stuck in a multi-year rut, as Ecolab has proven by mostly outrunning woes from oil drilling. It can also power the creation of shareholder value, as demonstrated by the rapidly growing dividend from American Water Works. And sometimes, a strong cash flow is enough to buy a heavily indebted company facing political scandals the benefit of the doubt as management executes against long-term strategies.
Long story short, strong cash flows from mature businesses provide plenty of financial flexibility and stability. Knowing that, why shouldn't every portfolio own at least one cash cow?

Video games are becoming more valuable thanks to favorable industry shifts like the drive toward digital purchasing. These changes have helped produce market-thumping gains for shareholders lately. In fact, industry leader Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) is the second best-performing stock on the S&P 500 in 2017 as of this writing, with a 53% spike so far. Its rival Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) isn't far behind, at a 35% increase on the year.
Below, we'll take a closer look at the top developers that might make the best bets for long-term investors.

Activision Blizzard
Activision Blizzard is a collection of development studios that each dominates its respective segment. The Blizzard business focuses on PC gaming with hits like World of Warcraft and Overwatch. The Activision side, meanwhile, owns the Call of Duty franchise, which has consistently been the most popular console game in the industry for the last decade. Also, the publisher's King digital segment tops the mobile download charts with Candy Crush.

Activision Blizzard's business is shifting in two positive ways right now. First, the move toward digital downloading has cut costs while also allowing the company to extend the lifecycle of its titles. Rather than collecting nearly all a game's profits around its launch window, for example, Activision is increasingly using content updates to keep players engaged throughout the year, making for a more profitable operation.
Second, the company's deep portfolio is lowering the risk of a flop in any single franchise. Last year, its biggest four titles accounted for 75% of revenue. Back in 2013, just three franchises, Call of Duty, Skylanders, and World of Warcraft, were responsible for 80% of sales and an even greater portion of earnings.

            });
        

Electronic Arts
Electronic Arts frequently clashes with Activision Blizzard at the top of sales charts. Its Battlefield franchise is one of the most popular shooters on consoles, and it enjoys a strong PC business led by intellectual property like The Sims. EA also covers the sports segment well through FIFA, the world's biggest sports gaming franchise, along with Madden and other professional sports titles.
The company generated $1 billion in profit over its last fiscal year through $4.3 billion of revenue. Activision Blizzard booked nearly the same amount of earnings, although from a much larger sales base of $6.6 billion.
EA's financial performance has been spectacular over the past four years as gross profit margin improved to 75% of sales from 62%, and annual operating cash flow jumped to $1.5 billion from $800 million. One of the most promising trends investors are watching for in its future is the trend toward subscription services, like EA Access. Platforms like that boost recurring revenue while pushing profitability higher.
Take Two Interactive
Take Two's (NASDAQ:TTWO) biggest video game hits include BioShock, Borderlands, NBA 2K, and Red Dead. But the publisher is best known for Grand Theft Auto, which is among the industry's most iconic franchises with over 240 million unit sales over its life to date.
Take Two hasn't been able to translate that solid portfolio into consistent earnings, though. Its deep dependence on the GTA franchise, for example, helped produce a 53% revenue slump in 2015, and the publisher has generated a net loss in three of the past five years, too. Take Two isn't quite as well positioned to take advantage of the stampede toward digital as its bigger rivals, either. E-commerce sales represented less than half of its business last year, compared to 54% for EA and 74% for Activision Blizzard.
While they wait for Take Two to build up a more diverse business, investors should focus on Activision and EA as the best vehicles to gain exposure to this industry. Sure, neither is particularly cheap right now, at over 35 times the past year's profits. But for my money, Activision represents the better bet even though EA is likely to have a stronger 2017. Over the long term, the leading publisher is ideally positioned to profit from any number of positive trends in the industry, including digital sales, mobile advertising, eSports, and game broadcasting.

Retirees should generally buy low-risk stocks that generate reliable income. But in today's frothy market, it may seem risky to buy dividend stocks -- especially if interest rate hikes convince investors to dump richly valued income stocks in favor of bonds with comparable yields. 
However, there are still plenty of dependable dividend stocks on the market with below-average valuations. Today I'll examine one of my favorite long-term income plays, AT&T (NYSE:T), and explain why it could still be a solid dividend stock for retirees.

A dividend aristocrat
After a company raises its dividend annually for 25 straight years, it becomes an elite ""dividend aristocrat"" and highly valued by income investors. AT&T has hiked its payout annually for 32 straight years, which puts in on that short list of 52 companies. 
That coveted status indicates that AT&T won't stop raising its dividend anytime soon. AT&T's closest rival, Verizon (NYSE:VZ), has only raised its dividend annually for ten straight years.
A high yield and sustainable payout ratios
AT&T pays a forward dividend yield of 5.1%, which is more than double the S&P 500's current yield of 2%. It's also slightly higher than Verizon's forward yield of 5%.
A high yield is tempting, but we should always check a company's payout ratio -- the percentage of its earnings or free cash flow (FCF) which is spent on dividends -- to see if the dividend is sustainable. If that ratio exceeds 100% for an extended period, a dividend cut could be in the cards. 
Over the past 12 months, AT&T spent 95% of its earnings and 70% of its FCF on dividend payments. Verizon spent 77% of its earnings on dividends during the same period, but those payments used up over 100% of its FCF -- which remained negative over the past year due to declines in its wireless business, debt and pension obligations, and its planned buyout of Yahoo's internet business.

            });
        

A low valuation and reliable growth
AT&T trades at 19 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 21 for domestic telecom companies. That's slightly higher than Verizon's P/E of 16, but investors may be willing to pay a premium for AT&T's slightly higher yield and more sustainable payout ratios. 
As for the growth of its core business, AT&T has been expanding aggressively with two major deals. First, it acquired DirecTV in mid-2015, which made it the largest pay TV provider in the world and broadened its bundling options for wireless and wireline plans.

Second, it agreed to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), which will add valuable media properties like HBO and Warner Bros. to its portfolio. AT&T intends to bundle all these products together with cross-platform streaming and ""sponsored data"" -- which offers data-free streaming to its wireless subscribers.
For now, analysts expect AT&T's revenue to slip 1% this year and rise 1% next year. Earnings are expected to rise 3% this year and 2% next year. However, those estimates don't include the benefits of the Time Warner deal yet, since the megamerger still hasn't been fully approved by regulators.
Predictable stock performance
AT&T's 16% gain over the past five years underperformed the S&P 500's 70% growth, but retirees will likely value price stability and steady dividends over price appreciation. AT&T's stock has held steady all these years due to two factors. 
First, its moat is so wide that only a handful of companies, like Verizon, can keep competing. That moat will be further widened by the DirecTV and Time Warner deals. Second, AT&T's high dividend yield and low valuation set a floor under the stock, enabling it to rebound from even the worst market meltdowns.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-79536');
            });
        

So is AT&T an ideal retirement play?
I believe that AT&T is one of the safest income-generating retirement stocks on the market. However, retirees should still be aware of the company's two main weaknesses. First, its postpaid wireless growth is slowing down due to market saturation and tougher competition from rival telcos. 
Second, AT&T is taking on a lot of debt to finance the DirecTV and Time Warner deals -- although the overall threat to its long-standing dividend is minimal. If you believe that AT&T can counter those two challenges, it's probably time to add this high-yielding, classic dividend play to your retirement portfolio.

As some of the greatest investing minds will tell you, buying and holding high-quality companies over the long term is going to give you the best chance of generating a healthy return on your investment. This has been a modus operandi for Warren Buffett, and it can work for patient investors, too.
According to an analysis conducted by J.P. Morgan Asset Management, buying and holding the S&P 500 index between Jan. 1, 1995, and Dec. 31, 2014, would have netted a return of 555%, or a healthy 9.9% per year. Mind you, this return was achieved despite both the dot-com bubble bursting and the Great Recession. If you missed just the 10 best trading days of this over 5,000-day period, your return was more than halved, and if you missed a little more than 30 of the best trading days, you'd have lost money.

For some investors, this is all the evidence they need to park their money in low-cost index funds over the long run. However, simply matching the performance of the market isn't good enough for certain investors (including yours truly). They want to beat the market.
How does a 153,500% return over 33 years sound?
Over the past couple of decades, a number of stocks have absolutely crushed the broader market, many of which are tech-based. Technology giant Apple, software kingpin Microsoft, and e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com have returned a respective 25,500%, 71,600%, and 63,800%, respectively, when rounded to the nearest 100% since their inception. This means an initial $1,000 investment would have yielded over $700,000 in the case of Microsoft.
But another non-tech-based company has essentially gained as much as all three of these household names combined since it debuted. With a gain of almost 153,500% since September 1984, inclusive of splits, biotech blue-chip Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) would have turned a $1,000 investment in to more than $1.53 million as of today.
How on earth are these returns possible? Let's try to summarize in a few points why Amgen is such a great company.

A vast product portfolio
The easiest answer as to why Amgen has been so successful is the company's product portfolio. Since the late 1980s through today, innovation has driven Amgen's results. In the late '80s through mid-'90s, Amgen used the discovery of Epogen, Neulasta, Aranesp, and Neupogen to drive its results. Even today, Neulasta, a white blood cell-enhancing medicines for those undergoing cancer treatment, is its best-selling drug with $1.21 billion in sales during the first quarter.
However, Amgen's product portfolio has grown considerably more diverse over time. Within the past two years, it's expanded into a completely new indication and cardiovascular medicines, and it has an even keener focus on cancer than in years past. Examples include multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis, which has a shot at generating $800 million in annual sales in 2017, as well as Repatha, an injectable LDL cholesterol-lowering drug that could transform how high-risk patients fight high cholesterol levels.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-89485');
            });
        

A healthy pipeline
On top of having a diversified product portfolio, Amgen's strength in recent years has been a result of it advancing a number of late-stage products (many of which have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration). It's brought around a half-dozen new therapies to market since Dec. 2014 and currently has more than 30 ongoing clinical trials. Some of these offer label expansion opportunities for existing medicines, while others are completely novel therapies.
Beyond just its traditional drug development pipeline, Amgen is working to develop a small army of biosimilar therapies. Biosimilars are copycat versions of biologic drugs that are priced at a discount to brand-name therapies. Included in its biosimilar pipeline is a drug that could give Humira, the current best-selling drug in the world, a run for its money.

Acquisitions
Though Amgen has done an excellent job of developing drugs internally and expanding the indications of owned drugs, acquisitions have played a critical role throughout its history.
For instance, Amgen acquired Immunex in May 2009 for what seemed like a hefty price of $16 billion. However, that $16 billion would prove to be something of a steal with Amgen getting the rights to anti-inflammatory drug Enbrel. Last year, Enbrel generated $6 billion in sales for the company, with much of its growth in recent years a result of Amgen's exceptional pricing power.
More recently, Amgen acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals for $10.4 billion in order to get its hands on Kyprolis and Onyx's other developing cancer therapeutics. Kyprolis is in a very competitive cancer space, but it's nonetheless been growing by a double-digit percentage since it was acquired.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-77741');
            });
        

Shareholder returns have helped a lot
Of course, we can't forget to tip our caps to Amgen's management team for its capital return policy. Amgen began paying a dividend to investors in 2011 (dividends from biotech stocks were somewhat unheard of prior to Amgen declaring a dividend six years ago). Over the past six years, this payout has more than quadrupled to $1.15 each quarter from $0.28.
Furthermore, Amgen was no stranger to using share repurchases to buoy its share price during the 2000s, which is when its drug innovation slowed a bit. Having fewer shares outstanding can help boost earnings per share and make a company appear more attractive to investors.

Amgen's probably not done yet
Best of all, Amgen's run may not be anywhere near done. A lot is going to depend on how successful it is in building its cardiovascular portfolio and in expanding the uses of its approved cancer therapeutics.
Right now, Amgen is valued at less than 13 times Wall Street's estimated 2017 EPS of $12.46, and the company is on track to possibly generate more than $14 per share in full-year EPS by the end of the decade. Given its ability to trim costs if necessary and its ample cash flow to snap up attractive acquisitions, it's not inconceivable that Amgen's stock could double within the next decade.

Anyone who reads articles about finance and investing has a right to be skeptical of what they read. Who's to say that the writer doesn't have an ulterior motive? Are they trying to get you do do something that will directly benefit them? There's also the problem of financial content providers offering up advice that they themselves wouldn't take.
So in the spirit of full disclosure -- and of eating one's own cooking -- I want to share with you the three biggest stock holdings in my portfolio: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), American Tower (NYSE:AMT), and Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD). Here's a brief explanation of why I continue to hold onto these companies.  

Image source: Getty Images

A non-tech approach to Apple
I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a techie. I'm usually the person who says ""Why the heck would anyone want that,"" when a new device, app or service appears, only to discover I was completely wrong as it takes off. So I can't speak with any authority on the tech behind Apple's products. The reasons that it's one of my three largest holdings have nothing to do with it being a tech company, though.
Two factors make Apple appealing as an investment to me: pricing power, and shareholder-friendly buybacks and dividends. The one thing that even I can understand about technology is that it rapidly becomes commoditized, which typically makes competition in products such as smartphones and laptops a race to the bottom, where margins go to die. Apple has separated itself from its rivals in that regard, thanks in large part to the brand it has nurtured for all these years.
When the first iPhone was launched in 2007, the initial retail price was $499, which at the time seemed absurd to me. Yes, I even remember saying at the time, ""My Nokia brick phone does everything I need already."" Despite its high price, the iPhone sold like gangbusters, to the point that today it owns a 30% share of the U.S. smartphone market, plus significant market share overseas. Furthermore, rumors floating around suggest that the new iPhone 8 will start at $999. Sure, the tech in the iPhone 8 is far beyond what that first model offered, but what is incredible is that there's still such huge demand for the company's products at those premium prices when there are so many lower-cost options out there.
That kind of pricing power translates to almost unfathomable amounts of free cash flow -- so much so that there is no way Apple can spend it all on developing new products. So instead, it's spending tens of billions of dollars on share buybacks and paying an increasing dividend. While some may periodically criticize the company for the timing of those stock repurchases, it's hard to argue against the long-term impact of reducing its share count. 
Perhaps this isn't the most insightful or eloquent investment thesis for Apple, but it's mine, and I feel comfortable riding it for several more years.
An unsophisticated investment approach to data
American Tower is another company leveraged to the world of technology, but it does so in the least technological way possible. It's a real estate investment trust that owns cellular network towers and leases space on them to wireless service providers. The most influential factor in why it is one of my largest holdings is it also happens to be one of my first stock holdings -- along with Apple, not surprisingly. The investment thesis I developed around American Tower is based on two things: the long-term trend toward greater data usage, and the long-term growth of its dividend payment.
Again, I'm not a tech guy, but it doesn't take a tech genius to look around and see everyone's faces buried in smartphones and realize it takes an impressive amount of infrastructure to support that much data usage. And when you look at the numbers, they're staggering. Total data traffic in the U.S. alone in 2016 was 13.75 exabytes -- or 13.75 trillion megabytes. That's 3.3 times more than total data used in 2014. Moreover, American Tower estimates that U.S. data traffic will increase to 34.8 exabytes by 2020 as wireless carriers start to roll out 5G service.
For wireless carriers, increasing data usage means they need to deploy more equipment to support their respective networks, and that hardware gets mounted on towers owned by companies like American Tower. And by leasing space on each tower to multiple tenants, those companies drastically improve their return on investment. 
And naturally, the rising data use trend isn't just happening in the U.S. One of the most intriguing opportunities for American Tower is in the developing world, where wired connections are fewer and farther between. American Tower is investing heavily overseas in places where wireless penetration is high, but broadband penetration is still developing. In markets like that, the economics of cellphone towers are spectacular.

All that aside, here's what puts American Tower over the top for me as an investment: It's a business with high levels of recurring revenue and few maintenance capital obligations. Those factors make it ideally suited to generating free cash flow that can be returned to investors. While American Tower's 1.93% dividend won't wow anyone, management has grown that payout by 181% over the past five years. 
American Tower is probably the most unsexy way to invest in the sexy trend of increasing data use around the world, but the company has proven thus far to be a great long-term investment, and it's one I plan to hold onto for a long time.

If I had to pick one energy investment, this is it
Of all the companies in the oil and gas sector, I can't think of one I would want to own over the long haul more than Enterprise Products Partners. As a midstream operator that focuses on the transportation, logistics, and processing of hydrocarbons, it has the benefit of being largely insulated from the ups and downs of oil and gas prices. As it stands today, more than 85% of the company's gross profits come from fixed-fee contracts with volume commitments. This type of contract structure ensures Enterprise has a relatively steady revenue stream that supports the sustained growth of its network, and allows it to pay a generous distribution to its shareholders.
There are a lot of similar companies in this business, and many of them share many qualities with Enterprise, like those fixed-fee contracts and handsome payouts. What separates Enterprise from the rest, though, is the way in which management handles the business. 
One element where Enterprise's excellence first shows up is in its corporate structure. It doesn't have multiple subsidiaries below it, and the parent organization above it doesn't charge management fees (known in this sector as incentive distribution rights). Instead, that parent entity -- a holding company -- owns a significant portion of stock, but its holdings are of the same share class any retail investor can buy today. That means management's goals are more directly aligned with the interests of the other investors than is common among other companies in this business. This simpler structure also means Enterprise enjoys a lower cost of capital than rivals that carry the burden of incentive distribution rights. Also worth mentioning is that's it's just easier to understand Enterprise's financials because you don't have to follow the money through many corporate layers.
The other thing that sets Enterprise's management apart is they have been great stewards of shareholder capital over the years. They have struck a great balance of paying a high-yield dividend, giving themselves plenty of room to grow that dividend every quarter, and retaining enough cash to grow the business without having to rely exclusively on external capital sources like debt and equity. These traits don't lend themselves to the production of intermittent blowout quarters, but they do translate to steady returns that have, over the years, obliterated the S&P 500 on a total return basis.

I don't know how much longer it will be before the U.S. and other developed countries start to shift away from fossil fuels in a meaningful way, but my guess is that it's still quite a few years away. As long as oil and gas provide the lion's share of our energy, then the company I want to own more than any other in this industry is Enterprise Products Partners.

For wireless carriers, increasing data usage means they need to deploy more equipment to support their respective networks, and that hardware gets mounted on towers owned by companies like American Tower. And by leasing space on each tower to multiple tenants, those companies drastically improve their return on investment. 
And naturally, the rising data use trend isn't just happening in the U.S. One of the most intriguing opportunities for American Tower is in the developing world, where wired connections are fewer and farther between. American Tower is investing heavily overseas in places where wireless penetration is high, but broadband penetration is still developing. In markets like that, the economics of cellphone towers are spectacular.

All that aside, here's what puts American Tower over the top for me as an investment: It's a business with high levels of recurring revenue and few maintenance capital obligations. Those factors make it ideally suited to generating free cash flow that can be returned to investors. While American Tower's 1.93% dividend won't wow anyone, management has grown that payout by 181% over the past five years. 
American Tower is probably the most unsexy way to invest in the sexy trend of increasing data use around the world, but the company has proven thus far to be a great long-term investment, and it's one I plan to hold onto for a long time.

If I had to pick one energy investment, this is it
Of all the companies in the oil and gas sector, I can't think of one I would want to own over the long haul more than Enterprise Products Partners. As a midstream operator that focuses on the transportation, logistics, and processing of hydrocarbons, it has the benefit of being largely insulated from the ups and downs of oil and gas prices. As it stands today, more than 85% of the company's gross profits come from fixed-fee contracts with volume commitments. This type of contract structure ensures Enterprise has a relatively steady revenue stream that supports the sustained growth of its network, and allows it to pay a generous distribution to its shareholders.
There are a lot of similar companies in this business, and many of them share many qualities with Enterprise, like those fixed-fee contracts and handsome payouts. What separates Enterprise from the rest, though, is the way in which management handles the business. 
One element where Enterprise's excellence first shows up is in its corporate structure. It doesn't have multiple subsidiaries below it, and the parent organization above it doesn't charge management fees (known in this sector as incentive distribution rights). Instead, that parent entity -- a holding company -- owns a significant portion of stock, but its holdings are of the same share class any retail investor can buy today. That means management's goals are more directly aligned with the interests of the other investors than is common among other companies in this business. This simpler structure also means Enterprise enjoys a lower cost of capital than rivals that carry the burden of incentive distribution rights. Also worth mentioning is that's it's just easier to understand Enterprise's financials because you don't have to follow the money through many corporate layers.
The other thing that sets Enterprise's management apart is they have been great stewards of shareholder capital over the years. They have struck a great balance of paying a high-yield dividend, giving themselves plenty of room to grow that dividend every quarter, and retaining enough cash to grow the business without having to rely exclusively on external capital sources like debt and equity. These traits don't lend themselves to the production of intermittent blowout quarters, but they do translate to steady returns that have, over the years, obliterated the S&P 500 on a total return basis.

I don't know how much longer it will be before the U.S. and other developed countries start to shift away from fossil fuels in a meaningful way, but my guess is that it's still quite a few years away. As long as oil and gas provide the lion's share of our energy, then the company I want to own more than any other in this industry is Enterprise Products Partners. 

",My 3 Biggest Stock Holdings
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/16/why-rite-aid-hr-block-and-nantkwest-slumped-today.aspx,2017-05-16,"
Tuesday was a relatively quiet day for the stock market, with the Nasdaq Composite pushing further into record-high territory even as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials posted very small declines. The ongoing tension between a strong U.S. economy and numerous potential threats from the geopolitical and global economic environment continued, and that's a key reason why there have been so many days of minimal changes in stock market indexes lately. Yet among individual stocks, there were definitely some companies facing troubles, and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), and NantKwest (NASDAQ:NK) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Rite Aid once again faces new merger questions
Shares of Rite Aid dropped 8% after reports surfaced that federal regulators are directing even more scrutiny at the drugstore chain's potential merger with industry rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). The deal has already hit several roadblocks along the way, forcing the parties to find divestitures to satisfy antitrust concerns and leading Walgreens to cut its proposed purchase price for Rite Aid. Yet now, even after all the concessions that Rite Aid has made, the prospect for further questioning makes the odds even worse that the merger will take place as planned. That would be a particularly difficult outcome for Rite Aid, and the declines in its stock price reflect the about-face that having to figure out a way forward as an independent company would require from the drugstore chain.

H&R Block faces a leadership transition
H&R Block stock fell 6% in the wake of the announced departure of CEO Bill Cobb. The tax preparation giant said that Cobb will retire as chief executive and from the board of directors as of July 31, and it has named Thomas Gerke as interim CEO as of Aug. 1. Cobb is seen as having done a good job of bringing H&R Block back from difficult times, with an increased emphasis on tax prep rather than some more controversial businesses like finance. However, the prospects for tax reform that could dramatically simplify taxes for average Americans could pose a major threat to H&R Block's business model, and having to deal with a transition in leadership at the same time puts H&R Block at somewhat of a disadvantage compared to its peers in the space.

            });
        

NantKwest gives back some ground
Finally, shares of NantKwest declined 17%. The clinical-stage biotechnology company likely saw traders take profits after last week's huge run-up following the granting of Investigational New Drug status to its NANT cancer vaccine. The designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows the company to use early stage clinical trials to look at how the vaccine works with pancreatic cancer patients. However, with the stock having risen by more than 50% between last Tuesday and yesterday, investors apparently decided that the extent of the gains in NantKwest stock had gotten ahead of themselves. Shareholders will want to look closely at NantKwest's upcoming presentation at a healthcare conference later this week to find out the latest about the company's future plans.

Sliding hepatitis C sales have made Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) shares one of the market's worst performers since 2015. However, its HIV drug sales are growing, and Gilead Sciences has tens of billions of dollars in cash it can use to kick-start growth through mergers and acquisitions. Is this company showing signs that it's about to turn a corner?


In this clip from The Motley Fool's Industry Focus: Healthcare podcast, analyst Kristine Harjes is joined by Todd Campbell to discuss Gilead Sciences performance this year, its product pipeline, and the obstacles it has to overcome to see its shares head higher again.

A full transcript follows the video.







This video was recorded on May 17, 2017.

Kristine Harjes: We said we were going to talk about Gilead Sciences, and that was not a lie. It is now time to dive into Gilead.
Todd Campbell: This one hits a little bit close to home for me, Kristine, and I think maybe it does for you, too?
Harjes: As a shareholder? Yeah.
Campbell: Yeah. This is a stock that is a behemoth in biotech. And unfortunately, its shares have fallen from $120 to about $65 since the summer of 2015, making the comparison even worse when you look at the fact that the S&P 500 has rallied and has been flirting with new highs. This stock has gotten clobbered. And it's been a tough run for shareholders like me, and I have to -- can we do a little confessional here?
Harjes: Let's hear it.
Campbell: I confess, I made a grave error in the way I normally approach stocks. I usually buy stocks -- we talked about this last week -- based on a particular catalyst, and then when I'm evaluating whether or not to hold the stock, I see if anything's changed that catalyst. Now, normally, if the catalyst has failed to pan out or change, that's a signal to me that I should sell or exit the stock. My catalyst did, indeed, change for Gilead, and I did not sell the stock. My cost is somewhere in the $90s, I'm down 20%-25%.
Harjes: What was the catalyst that you were looking for?
Campbell: I really thought their leadership in developing hepatitis C drugs was going to allow them to continue to innovate and dominate the market, which they have. But I also felt they would be able to innovate shorter and shorter treatment duration, getting it down to as little as four weeks over time from the 12 weeks it is currently. And it does look like that's not in the cards. It looks like they're slowing down their efforts to continue to move the needle in developing new products for hepatitis C. I also underestimated the negative drag and impact of price concessions they would be forced to make to stay ahead of competitors like AbbVie. And, I also had bought it originally because I had some good thoughts that they would do well with their push into cancer drugs, and unfortunately that was a bust. Yet I looked at it and said, this is still a very profitable company, and now they're paying a dividend, and they have a ton of cash on the balance sheet, so I guess I'll stick around. Obviously, so far, that's been the wrong choice.
Harjes: The thing is, you talked a lot about hepatitis C, and I think that is what most people focus on with this company. But if you look at what has happened to the company over the course of its HCV life cycle, its first hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, was approved in December 2013. At the time of approval, Gilead's market cap was $114 billion. Today's market cap of $86 billion is 25% lower than that. For me, I look at this company and I just can't help but think that the market has overreacted to its hepatitis C woes. And you're totally right about cancer not quite panning out, but I don't think there is as high hope and drama and expectation tied into its oncology efforts, necessarily, as it was for HCV sales.
Campbell: Yeah. I agree with you, in some respects. But here's the problem: We have yet to find a floor on those hepatitis C sales. In Q1, revenue came in a $2.6 billion across their hepatitis C franchise. That was down from $4.3 billion the year before.
Harjes: Yeah, that's a 40% decline.
Campbell: Yeah, massive drag. As a result, Q1 total sales were $6.5 billion. That was down 16.5%. EPS fell from $3.03 last year to $2.23 this year, ouch.
Harjes: Yeah, and I totally agree that that does hurt. But I think with this company, it's important to remember that they have other things going on. In particular, their HIV products were very good in the last quarter. And that was how this company really made its name. Its HIV and HBV product sales were up year over year in the first quarter 13% to $3.3 billion. That's a good thing. Sales fell for some of the older products, but it was made up for by the newer ones like Genvoya and Descovy and Odefsey.
Campbell: Right. They've enjoyed a lot of growth, and that's because they reformulated Viread. They made it safer, and now they've been rolling out combination therapies that replace Viread in those combinations with TAF, this new formulation. I imagine that we'll probably see a leveling off in sales growth there once all the combination therapies have been launched. But yes, they remain a dynamo in that business. It's a great business for them, and it's been a growing business for them; it just hasn't been growing fast enough to offset the slide in sales in hepatitis C. So, you look at it from an investment standpoint now, and you say, OK, well, we know that HIV is going to be stable to growing. That's good. And we know that hepatitis C is declining, and we don't know where the floor is.
Harjes: And that's bad.
Campbell: Yeah, that's bad. So, we say, what's the catalyst, what's going to cause this stock to get back to growth? Because, ultimately, we want to see sales grow, earnings grow. Shares will follow earnings over time. So we look at it and say, they have, first of all, a lot of money on the balance sheet, isn't it something like $32 billion?
Harjes: I have this right here -- $14.7 billion in cash. That's without their short-term investments.
Campbell: Yeah, and securities that they can sell as well. And they spend a ton on research and development. I think their run rate now on research and development is something like $3.6 billion. So they have a pipeline and they're working on that pipeline. So you say, maybe new drugs coming out of that pipeline, or acquisitions, because of all this cash, can spark growth, right?
Harjes: Yeah. So you have the organic side and you have the inorganic side. And when you look at the organic side, what are they actually developing themselves, they do have some exciting things going on. But it's going to be a while before we hear about any of them. And so that's when you get this pressure for the inorganic growth. And there has been so much speculation about who is Gilead going to buy, when are they finally going to pull the trigger? I do think, at least in the short term, that's the catalyst to watch. What are they going to do with that money? Who are they going to buy? When will they actually make a move to try to bolster their portfolio and get some more internal catalysts to get revenue moving in the right direction before, say, 2020, when they start getting data for all of the really awesome drugs in their pipeline that are not quite ready for market yet.
Campbell: Yeah. If you look at the lead candidates in the pipeline, you have filgotinib, which is the autoimmune-disease drug they're working with Galapagos on. Data for that should start rolling in, I think, as early as next year, stretching through 2020, depending on the indication and the trial we're talking about. Then there's another one for something called NASH, which is another liver disease, but, again, we won't see data from that until the 2020s as well. So you look at that and say, OK, there's not a whole heck of a lot that's going to, as far as drugs that are going to hit the market that could really make a big deal here. So what would be the M&A target? Can they buy something? Then, assuming they can cut a lot of overlapping expenses, maybe they can get operating margin moving in the right direction again. But only time will tell. We have to see how that plays out. And Gilead is being patient. They have the war chest, and they have the money, but they look at it from an operational standpoint, saying, ""I don't want to pay too much for this company when, three years from now, I could get it for a bargain.""
Harjes: Well, that, and they look at their own company and they say, ""Holy moley, this is cheap."" Gilead spent $14.8 billion on shareholder rewards in the last 16 months; $12 billion of that was on share repurchases. So this company is not interested in buying other overpriced assets when it could just buy back its own stock at pretty low valuations.
Campbell: Yeah. Although you take the other end of that coin and say, from a shareholder standpoint, is that the best use of your dollars? So far it has not been, because shares have still declined. So you brought back a lot of shares at a lot higher prices. Has that been the best use of your money, where if you had gone out and bought something like Medivation or something, to kick-start growth that way, would that have been a better reward for shareholders? Who knows? We don't know. The reality is, this remains a biotech behemoth. They're not going away. At some point, somewhere down the line, they're going to do something that will restart growth. The question will be, where will shares be at that point? Is this the low? Was $80 the low? Was $90 the low? I don't know.
Harjes: Right. And when they do it, we will absolutely have you covered here on Industry Focus.

With the S&P 500 down 1.5% over the past week, it seems turmoil in the Trump Administration isn't doing investors a lot of favors. But give Donald Trump credit where credit is due. His administration is doing great things for one segment of the stock market:
The defense industry.

Introducing Uncle Sam: Arms dealer to the world
We know this because late last month, the Trump Administration Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of a whole slew of big ticket arms deals in the works -- weapons sales that promise to pour literally billions of dollars of new revenues into the coffers of some of America's biggest defense contractors.
On one particularly big news day, April 28, the DSCA announced that it has notified Congress of no fewer than seven separate pending arms sales that it plans to push through. These deals are aiming to sell:

110 radar-seeking air-to-ground ""HARM"" missiles to Australia, generating sales of $137.6 million for prime contractors Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).
Four P-8A Poseidon submarine-hunting jet aircraft to New Zealand -- a $1.46 billion payday for Boeing (NYSE:BA).
13 76 mm cannon for installation aboard Israeli Navy SA'AR 4.5 and SA'AR 6 Missile Patrol Boats at a purchase price of $440 million. (Italian firm Leonardo S.p.a.'s DRS North America subsidiary will be the contractor on that one.)
Nine Bell 429 light utility helicopters to Slovakia, yielding sales of $150 million for Textron (NYSE:TXT).
And five CH-47D Chinook helicopters, sold out of U.S. government surplus to Greece for $80 million.

Also included in the DSCA's list of pending contracts are two directed toward the NATO Support and Procurement Agency, specifically:

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-28868');
            });
        



A $300 million sale of C-17 Globemaster III logistics support services, with Boeing acting as prime contractor; and
A $33.5 million sale of Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) components, used to protect C-17s from anti-aircraft missile attack, supplied by Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC).

Add them all up, and the global shopping list for U.S. arms comes to more than $2.6 billion in total value, with most of that going to benefit prime contractors Orbital ATK and Raytheon, Boeing, Textron, and Northrop Grumman -- some of the largest defense contractors on the planet, and stalwarts of the U.S. defense industry, each and every one.
And that's just the sales announced on April 28. Since those deals were announced, DSCA has also notified Congress of sales of military apparel to India, MD 530 ground attack fighters to Kenya, and air defense missiles to the United Arab Emirates -- additional billions of dollars worth of revenue for the companies involved.
What it means for investors
President Trump has proposed a new military budget that will feature tens of billions of dollars in increased defense spending for the Pentagon. But already, the President's administration is pushing Congress to approve billions of dollars in new weapons sales to America's allies. Between increased military spending at home and increased sales of military hardware abroad, it's boom times for the defense industry in America.
So is it any wonder that the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEMKT:ITA) is up 16% since the November election? Heck, if every single stock in the defense industry wasn't so clearly overvalued already, I might even buy a few of them myself.

Valeant has been labeled as the largest-ever money loser for the hedge fund industry, as the company's shares bombed from a peak of more than $257 in 2015 to a recent price of $14 per share.
Because Valeant is based in Canada, it was excluded from many of the largest U.S.-based index funds and ETFs, and thus its owners were primarily comprised of actively managed hedge funds and mutual funds. At one time, Ackman-managed funds were the company's single-largest shareholder, accounting for as much as 20% of Pershing Square's portfolios.
After falling in value, Pershing Square cut and ran from its Valeant investment. In a statement surrounding the sale, Ackman wrote that ""at its current market value, the Valeant position represented 1.5% to 3% of the various Pershing Square funds; however, the investment required a disproportionately large amount of time and resources.""
Pershing Square liquidated its positions in the company, and Ackman, who had a board seat at the company, chose not to stand for reelection. A report by Reuters suggested that Pershing's funds lost at least $3 billion on its Valeant investments.

Snacking on profits
Pershing Square sold 3 million shares of Mondelez International in the first quarter, reducing its stake by 13%.
This was the second time in a year that Ackman has cashed in on Mondelez. The stake was roughly halved in the first quarter of 2016, when Ackman reportedly sold Mondelez to paper over losses in Valeant. (The nitty-gritty details: Pershing Square's funds owned Valeant call options, and were short Valeant put options, which exposed its funds to outsize losses as Valeant shares cratered in value.)
Ackman wrote favorably of the Oreo maker in his most recent letter to investors in Pershing Square's closed-end fund:

Mondelez is one of the few large-cap packaged food companies that is demonstrating both margin expansion and top-line organic growth. Given Mondelez's innovation pipeline and market share opportunities, we expect organic sales growth to improve in the second half of the year. Over the long-term, we believe that Mondelez's categories and geographic footprint give it a significant competitive advantage, especially in the emerging markets where Mondelez's large market shares and robust routes to market should drive accelerated growth.

Pershing Square held about 20 million shares at the end of the first quarter, according to the 13F filing. Notably, the food company's recent profit growth has come from higher prices and cost cuts rather than increased volume.

Gassed out
Pershing Square reduced its stake in Air Products & Chemicals, a company that first appeared in its regulatory filings in the third quarter of 2013, locking in a gain for its investors.
The stock's price doesn't fully reflect Pershing Square's gains on the stock over the period, as Air Products & Chemicals spun off Versum Materials (NYSE:VSM) in the third quarter of 2015. Versum never appeared in a Pershing Square 13F, so one can conclude it was sold within the same quarter in which the shares were distributed to APD shareholders.
Ackman wrote in a letter to Pershing's investors that improvements in Air Products & Chemicals will largely rest in its ability to deploy capital or return excess cash to shareholders:

We believe the biggest driver of APD's earnings growth over the coming years will be the company's deployment of its excess capital. The company has $2.5 billion of excess cash and an additional $2.5 billion of debt capacity and will generate additional excess capital of $1 billion per year after paying dividends for a total of $8 billion of capital available for investment over the next three years. Absent sufficient attractive opportunities to deploy capital, we would expect Air Products to return capital to shareholders.

Air Products' own guidance for the 2017 fiscal year calls for earnings of $6.00 to $6.25 per share, a 6% to 11% improvement over 2016.
Ackman wrote that ""[w]hile management has been cautious on the economy, APD's business has historically closely tracked industrial production. U.S. industrial production has been negative in recent years, but has now turned positive since the election for the first time in the last 18 months."" Alas, Pershing Square's regulatory filings show that it has sold shares in each of the last three quarters.
Is Ackman losing his edge?
In a sign that the Pershing Square brand has lost some of its cachet after massive losses in Valeant, shares of its publicly traded closed-end fund recently traded for a 15% discount to their net asset value. On numerous occasions in 2015, shares briefly traded at a premium to net asset value.

Image by author. Data source: Pershing Square Holdings.

A discount to net asset value suggests that investors believe Pershing Square Holdings won't generate returns high enough to top the fund's lofty management fee. The closed-end fund carries stated fees of 1.5% plus 16% of returns, high by closed-end fund standards but fairly typical in the world of hedge funds.
Through May 9, 2017, the fund returned just 1.2% year to date, net of fees, from a portfolio of U.S. stocks, lagging the S&P 500, which returned about 7% over the same period.
But even after attention-grabbing losses in Valeant, Pershing Square's most loyal investors have earned market-beating returns. Pershing Square's oldest fund has earned 503% over a 13-year period ended Dec. 31, 2016, easily beating the 163% return of the S&P 500 over the same period. 
With that kind of record, Pershing's 13F is still one worth paying attention to.

",Stocks Billionaire Bill Ackman Is Selling Now
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/19/can-amazoncom-weather-a-recssion-and-market-downtu.aspx,2017-05-19,"
In many ways, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) seems recession-proof. The company's e-commerce operation has a reputation for offering low prices, and its Prime membership program offers significant value for just $99 a year, providing members with free two-day shipping on millions of items as well as video streaming and a slew of other benefits.
Since its inception, Amazon has staked its reputation on value, using efficiencies and the flywheel effect to drive it, and customers have bought into the proposition. Its cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services, is also likely to weather a recession as companies need data storage and other cloud services regardless of the economic climate.

Image source: Amazon.com.

 Amazon'd business fared well during the recent financial crisis, as revenue grew by 29.2% in 2008 and 28.4% in 2009. While those numbers were slower than the company's revenue growth in the years before and after, they still represent an exceptional growth rate at a time when many retailers were losing sales and overall retail sales were falling.
Earnings per share growth was also solid back then, increasing 33% in 2008 and then 37% in 2009. Back then, Amazon's profit margins were better than they are today as the company had yet to make massive investments in fulfillment centers, AWS, and other infrastructure that it has since. In 2009, it had profit margin of 3.7%, much better than the may of its competitors.
But what about Amazon's stock during a recession-fueled market downturn? How might it do?



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-98528');
            });
        


Don't get too excited 
While Amazon has proven that it can thrive even during a recession, the stock's performance has not always followed suit. Amazon shares lost nearly two-thirds of their value from their peak early in 2008 at $97.43 to their bottom at $34.68 in November 2008, a drop of 64.4%. The S&P 500 fell, by comparison, 56.8%.
In other words, despite Amazon's sustained revenue and profit growth during the recession, the market still punished it more than it did the average stock. That's because high-valued growth stocks like Amazon tend to fall more in bear markets as investors flee to safety and dividend payers.  
While the broad market plunged through 2008, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) stock actually gained that year as the retail giant is widely perceived to be recession-proof and its stock pays a dividend. Wal-Mart shares ultimately fell during the worst of the sell-off, but only lost 27% from their peak in September 2008 to their nadir in February 2009.
Now vs. then
 Amazon stock would probably face a similar tumble in a new market downturn as it did in 2008. Despite the e-commerce giant's strong profit growth recently, the stock still trades at a triple-digit price-to-earnings ratio. Amazon's share price has largely soared on the strength of its revenue growth and its evident competitive advantages, as the market expects profits to eventually justify its market cap over $400 billion. Amazon is such a unique company that it's difficult to value the stock, as future profits are highly unpredictable. The stock is particularly volatile for a company of its size, and often swings by double digits on its earnings reports.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-43715');
            });
        


That means that a bear market would be likely to push Amazon's stock down significantly, as it would with most growth stocks, since it would compress the overall valuation of the market. But the upside of such a move is that it would present an excellent buying opportunity to pick up new shares, as Amazon the business should be able to continue growing even in a down economy.
In fact, a recession could even make Amazon stronger as it would likely pressure a number of its retail rivals and force some of them out of business. Though Amazon stock would likely take a hit from a market downturn, over the long term the stock should be even stronger because of it.

",Can Amazon.com Weather a Market Downturn?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/22/apple-is-boring-and-thats-ok.aspx,2017-05-22,"
I read an article recently that questioned whether Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had lost its ""innovation mojo."" It's not the first piece of journalism to address Apple's ability to impress consumers like it once did, and it won't be the last. And, to be fair, I think it's a perfectly reasonable question to ask.
Apple's so-called innovations over the past few years have, for the most part, been slight upgrades (fingerprint sensors for the iPhone, a larger iPad with Apple Pencil, the Apple Watch, etc.) or a move into markets that were already established by other companies. In short, there's been nothing earth-shattering from Apple for quite some time.

Image source: Getty Images.

And for that reason, the case could be made that Apple is, well, a little boring. But the company has made it very clear, particularly in its latest quarter, that boring can be beneficial for investors.
Here are five quick reasons why a perceived, or real, lack of innovation from Apple hasn't mattered all that much.
1. Revenue, profits, and share buybacks are up
Apple reported a revenue increase of 4.5% year over year in the fiscal second quarter of 2017 and an earnings per share jump of 10.5%. That's not all that exciting, but consider that Apple's fiscal Q2 was the second consecutive quarter of growth after three consecutive quarters in 2016 of declining revenue.
As a result of the strong quarter, Apple increased its share buyback program. ""Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said. This boosts the company's capital return program to $300 billion and increases Apple's value for investors (what a snooze-fest, right?)
2. iPhones are still flying off the shelves
The company sold 51.8 million iPhones in the third quarter, which accounted for about 63% of the company's total revenue.
""We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,"" Apple Cook said. 
Strategy Analytics estimated that the iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone worldwide in the first quarter of this year, with the iPhone 7 Plus taking the No. 2 spot. Apple is still creating one of the most sought-after mobile devices, even after nearly a decade of iPhone sales. Seriously, can this company get any duller?

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-98610');
            });
        

3. Service revenue is growing 
Apple brought in $7 billion from the company's service segment in the most recent quarter, an increase of 18% year over year. This segment may not be as flashy as the iPhone, but it's been Apple's second-largest revenue stream for two straight quarters now, and it accounted for 13% of total revenue in Q2.

Image source: Apple.

This is an important category because it shows Apple's ability to bring in recurring revenue in addition to its hardware sales. Apple's active subscriptions now total 165 million, up from 150 million in the quarter ending in December. Wake me up when it's over. 
4. Stock price is rising, yet still priced relatively cheap
Apple's strong performance over the past few quarters has helped push the company's share price up more than 40% over the past six months and more than 60% over the past year. 

Even with its share price gains, the company's stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 18,which is far below the average P/E ratio of 24 for stocks in the S&P 500. So, one of the world's most valuable companies is trading at a relatively inexpensive price...I think I need a nap.

",Apple Is Boring -- and That's OK

Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, can be excellent ways to generate income from your stock portfolio while still providing excellent upside potential over the long run. Also, residential REITs can allow you to take advantage of the strong market for rental housing in the United States. There are several different types of residential REITs to choose from, so here are three that could make excellent additions to your stock portfolio in 2017.

Stock prices and dividend yields are current as of May 15, 2017.
Over the past 13 years, the homeownership rate in the U.S. has been steadily declining, and younger generations in particular aren't buying houses at the rate previous generations did. This has left homeownership at a generational low, and has resulted in a highly attractive rental market.

US Home Ownership Rate data by YCharts.
1. AvalonBay Communities
Apartment REIT AvalonBay Communities specializes in properties located in a handful of high-barrier coastal markets, such as New York City, Southern California, and Washington, D.C., where supply is low, rental demand is strong, and construction of new apartment properties is prohibitively expensive for would-be peers. As of March 2017, AvalonBay owned, either in full or in part, 284 apartment communities with more than 82,000 rental units.

Image source: Getty Images.

AvalonBay's preferred mechanism of growth is developing new properties from the ground up, and redeveloping (renovating) its existing properties, both of which can be excellent value creators. Think of it like this: Let's say that the average apartment property will produce a 7% annual return on your investment, so a $10 million property would generate $700,000 per year. Well, if you can build the same property from the ground up for just $7 million, you're now producing a 10% return on investment. Plus, you've created $3 million in equity. Of course, this is a simplified example, but this is why development is often more attractive than simply acquiring properties.
Since its 1994 IPO, AvalonBay has outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin, and has managed to raise its dividend at an annualized rate of 5.4%. With about two dozen new properties under development and continued strong fundamentals in the rental market, AvalonBay could have more good times ahead.
2. Mid-America Apartment Communities
Like AvalonBay, Mid-America Apartment Communities acquires, develops, and redevelops apartment properties. However, like the name implies, the company focuses on non-urban markets, with a particularly high concentration in the southeastern U.S.
Mid-America owns over 101,000 apartment homes, and while its properties are located throughout the Sunbelt, the company's top three markets are Atlanta, Dallas, and Charlotte. Essentially, the company targets markets with higher-than-average job growth, and properties whose price points appeal to a large portion of the market.
Mid-America has paid 93 consecutive quarterly dividends, and has a fantastic track record of increasing its payout over time. With a relatively low (for a REIT) 67% payout ratio, there should be plenty of room for future dividend increases. Over the past two decades, Mid-America Apartment Communities has averaged total returns of more than 13% per year, handily beating the overall market.

            });
        

3. American Homes 4 Rent
The majority of residential REITs focus on apartment properties, but American Homes 4 Rent is a rare exception. As of the first quarter of 2017, the company owns more than 48,000 single-family homes in 22 U.S. states.
Unlike the other two REITs on the list, American Homes 4 Rent acquires its properties, as opposed to developing new ones.However there are some pretty compelling reasons to accumulate a single-family portfolio. For one, there are very few REITs (just three as of this writing) focused on single-family homes, and American Homes 4 Rent is already the largest by a wide margin, giving it a big competitive advantage as well as massive opportunity for growth. After all, American Homes 4 Rent, the largest player in the segment, owns 48,000 homes, and there are more than 15 million single-family rental homes in the United States. That's a massive addressable market.
Although it's still a young REIT, the results so far have been promising. FFO per share, the REIT version of earnings, grew by 12.7% on a year-over-year basis, and occupancy rose to 96%. The company also recently received investment-grade (Baa3/BBB-) credit ratings, which should boost its financial flexibility and reduce its borrowing cost going forward.

",3 Top Residential REIT Stocks to Buy in 2017
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/17/3-dividend-stocks-that-laugh-at-market-crashes.aspx,2017-05-17,"
Market crashes are no fun, but they can be made more tolerable by owning shares of high-quality, dividend-paying stocks. No stock is truly crash-proof, but some hold up much better than others. We asked three of our contributors to each pick a dividend stock that they think wouldn't get derailed by a market crash. Their choices: McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL).
Burgers and fries for any market
Tim Green (McDonald's): Looking at McDonald's stock chart, you wouldn't even know there was a market crash in 2008. The stock paused its run upwards for a couple of years, but holding shares of McDonald's that were treading water over that period worked out a lot better than most other alternatives.

MCD data by YCharts
Given McDonald's focus on providing inexpensive food, it should be no surprise that the company does just fine during recessions. Revenue did decline just a bit in 2009, but profits held up well. The company's streak of annual dividend increases, which started in 1976, also went unbroken. The dividend has more than doubled since 2008.
McDonald's stock is far more expensive in terms of P/E today than it was back then, which means it's possible that the next market crash (whenever it arrives) will affect the stock more severely than the last one did. McDonald's trades for around 25 times earnings today, well above its P/E ratio of roughly 15 during much of 2008 and 2009.
McDonald's will need to justify that higher valuation with solid results. Looking to drive sales, the company is jumping on the mobile ordering bandwagon, and plans to launch mobile ordering nationwide by the end of this year. Initiatives like all-day breakfast have provided a boost, and the company will need to keep the momentum going.
130 years young
Cory Renauer (Johnson & Johnson): Not many companies have a museum that can serve as an enduring reminder of their ability to shrug off market crashes. This company recently cut the ribbon on one that highlights an endless array of its innovations that have been reshaping healthcare since 1886.

Image source: Johnson & Johnson.

Although sprawling conglomerates have given the structure a bad name, Johnson & Johnson has made a science out of acquiring businesses that complement its existing operations, while trimming away those that are no longer pulling their weight. In 2016 alone, the company completed 13 acquisitions and dropped eight units from a portfolio that now contains about 250 healthcare-related businesses.
It's been 55 years since J&J has gone an entire year without raising its dividend. With iconic brands in its consumer goods segment, economies of scale in its medical device segment, and innovative drugs in its pharmaceutical segment, I wouldn't be surprised if the streak continues for generations. While consumer goods and devices still generate a majority of J&J's total revenue, its stable of drugs with blockbuster sales also make J&J one of the best dividend stocks in pharmaceuticals.
At recent prices, Johnson & Johnson offers a nice 2.7% dividend yield with a payout that you can reasonably expect to continue rising, plus an incredibly resilient share price. During the 10-year period from January 2000 to January 2010, two crashes left the broad-market benchmark SPDR S&P 500 ETF 23.4% lower, while J&J shares notched a 39.7% gain. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, but I don't think you'll find another stock as good at shrugging off anything the economy throws at it.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-25105');
            });
        

The bathroom matters, even during a market crash!
Brian Stoffel (Colgate-Palmolive): I wouldn't exactly say that any dividend-paying company ""laughed"" at the Great Recession. But some of them certainly flexed their muscles versus the S&P 500. Colgate was one of those companies -- while its share price fell 28% from January 2008 to March 2009, that was a far cry from the 51%  plunge taken by the broader market.
The company is parent to some of the most popular household brands: Colgate toothpaste, Palmolive and SoftSoap cleansers, SpeedStick deodorants, and a variety of pet foods marketed under its Hill's Pet Nutrition segment.
While these products might not be sexy enough to appeal to the growth investor, their boring nature belies their huge strength: Even in the depths of a recession, people keep buying toothpaste, deodorant, and food for their pets. That helps explain why, from 2008 to 2010, sales at the company actually increased 1.5%,  even as unemployment boomed and the world economy faltered.
Shareholders who held throughout actually benefited from the stock's stumble: Their reinvested dividends bought them more shares than they'd otherwise have wound up with. Indeed, by March 9, 2009, the company's forward dividend yield stood at 3.1%.
Looking forward, that dividend is still enticing -- albeit at a lower yield of 2.2%. But over the past year, only 59%  of Colgate's free cash flow has been used to pay dividends, meaning it is both very safe, and has lots of room for growth.

As for individual stocks, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) made big moves following the companies' quarterly earnings reports.

Trade Desk's spiking growth
Advertising technology platform Trade Desk jumped 30% after posting surprisingly strong quarterly results in which sales rose 76% to $53.4 million and trounced management's February forecast that called for revenue of $43 million. Adjusted earnings also improved to $6.3 million even though the company had predicted zero profits by that metric.
Operations are benefiting from the shift by advertisers toward programmatic buying that delivers ads through a mix of digital channels, especially mobile devices. The company about tripled its mobile video and smart TV revenues while mobile in-app advertising rose 150%.
""Because of this shift to programmatic and the performance of our team,"" CEO Jeff Green said in a press release, ""our year is off to a great start in what has historically been the most difficult quarter to predict.""
Green and his executive team issued guidance for the current quarter that sees revenue clocking in at $67 million compared to consensus estimates targeting $61 million. The ad delivery specialist also raised its full-year forecast to ""at least"" $291 million, up from the prior prediction of $270 million. The stock surged in response to expectations that now show 43% revenue growth in 2017 rather than the 33% gains management had promised.

Nordstrom's flat results
Nordstrom's stock fell nearly 11% despite first-quarter results that met management's expectations on the top and bottom lines. Comparable-store sales dipped 0.8% to mark a slight worsening from the 0.4% decline the retailer posted for fiscal 2016. Success in its off-price division and e-commerce offerings was more than offset by a 6.4% comps slump in its core retailing stores, where revenue dipped to $1.48 billion from $1.58 billion a year ago. Nordstrom's profitability held steady at 34.3% of sales and, thanks to shrinking expenses, adjusted profit margin improved to 3.5% of sales from 2.8%.

Executives said they were happy with the financial wins during the quarter but aimed to do better with respect to sales growth. ""While we're pleased with our inventory and expense execution, we're not satisfied with our top-line results,"" company president Blake Nordstrom said in the conference call.
The retailer affirmed its underwhelming forecasts for 2017. Comparable sales will be flat, but a rising count of off-price stores should push net sales up by between 3% and 4%. Rising profits from its co-branded credit card should help profits rise, though.
Overall, those results keep the retailer on track to essentially repeat its underwhelming fiscal 2016 performance. Investors were apparently looking for evidence of a rebound instead, and so the stock declined.
",What Happened in the Stock Market Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/18/better-buy-procter-gamble-company-vs-coca-cola.aspx,2017-05-18,"
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are two of the most revered companies in the U.S. Each is more than a century old, and they are the global leaders in their respective categories -- P&G in household products, and Coke in beverages.
Each has a portfolio of brands that are known around the world. Among P&G's more prominent names are Gillette, Tide, Crest, and Pampers, while Coca-Cola has Sprite, Fanta, and Minute Maid in addition to its namesake family of Coke drinks.

As stocks, the two have several similarities also. Both are Dividend Aristocrats and solid dividend payers, and the two stocks behave as defensive consumer staples as investors tend to seek shelter in them during weak markets. But they have both underperformed the recent bull market, as the chart below shows.

PG data by YCharts
As you can see, both stocks have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years. Still, market conditions can change sooner than you think. Let's take a closer look at each these stocks to see which one is the better buy today.
The whole drugstore and then some
Procter & Gamble's products may be in more homes than any other company in the world. The company has built a global empire by establishing leading positions across a wide range of household goods, including paper products, diapers, detergent, razors, toothpaste, deodorant, and dish soap.
P&G has 21 billion-dollar brands and another 11 with more than $500 million in annual sales. There's no doubting the strength of the company's brands, but recent growth has been more wanting. The company has been in the process of selling off non-core brands such as Cover Girl and 40 other beauty brands to Coty and Duracell to Berkshire Hathaway in an attempt to focus on core assets. However, that strategy has delivered mixed results.
In its most recent quarter, organic sales increased just 1%, though cost-cutting led to currency-neutral core EPS growth of 15%. Organic sales in the company's grooming segment fell 6% as the company continues to face pressure from subscription services like Dollar Shave Club, now owned by rival Unilever (NYSE:UL), and Harry's. Still, for the full year the company sees just mid-single-digit growth in core EPS. While P&G has been focused on cost-cutting, it seems to be losing to rival Unilever, which has been more focused on growth and acquisitions, even earning takeover interest from Kraft Heinz Company. 

Image source: Coca-Cola.

Taste the feeling
Coke's recent results bear a strong resemblance to Procter & Gamble's, as sales growth has been difficult to come by but earnings have been boosted by cost-cutting and share buybacks. In the company's most recent quarter, organic revenues were flat, though that included two fewer days in the quarter and the loss of the Easter holiday. Adjusted earnings per share fell from $0.45 to $0.43, and management expects adjusted EPS to fall 1-3% for the full year.
Coke is currently undergoing a transformation plan, which involves a number of initiatives that should determine the company's growth over the next few years. Among those initiatives are uniting its trademark Coke brands as part of its ""One Brand"" marketing campaign, designed to extend the halo of Coca-Cola to its other trademarks. That also includes using smaller bottles, which have done well, for portion control. Coke will also focus on growth in emerging markets more and refranchise bottling operations. 
In recent years, Coca-Cola has made efforts to diversify away from its core business, making investments in Keurig Green Mountain, which was later bought out, and Monster Beverage. The company also continues to acquire smaller brands such Ades, a Latin American soy-based beverage brand.
Still, Coca-Cola has generally been unable to overcome the headwinds in the industry as American and others turn away from sugary drinks and diet sodas in favor of water, coffee, and other beverages outside of Coke's brand family.

Who's the better buy?
Coke and Procter & Gamble face similar situations today. Many investors will look to these stocks for their dividends. Coca-Cola has a slightly better dividend yield at 3.4% against P&G's 3.2% yield. Coke has also offered bigger dividend raises in recent years, so it's likely to remain the better dividend payer, share appreciation notwithstanding. Each company has a similar payout ratio in the 75% range.
While I believe both sectors, beverages and household products, offer better picks than these two, of the two stocks P&G seems to be the better choice. The company has delivered better earnings growth recently, and is not facing the same challenges in consumer tastes that soda is. If Procter & Gamble can overcome its challenges in grooming, the stock should be back on track.

One of the reasons bank stocks have surged since the presidential election is that investors expect the current administration to follow through on Trump's campaign vow to lower the top corporate tax rate from 35% to as low as 15%. But while all banks would benefit from this, as would all other profitable companies, few would gain as much as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The nation's second-biggest bank by assets paid $7.3 billion in income taxes last year. Only five companies on the S&P 500 paid more than that, with two of those also happening to be banks -- JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.

Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author.

Why do banks pay so much in taxes compared to other companies? The simple answer is that they earn more money. Apple is the only company in the country that earns more than JPMorgan Chase. Wells Fargo and Bank of America aren't far behind. Their net incomes over the past 12 months rank them fourth and sixth on the S&P 500, respectively.
Unlike most other leading blue-chip companies, banks use an enormous amount of leverage, typically holding $10 worth of assets for every $1 in shareholders' equity. This allows banks to scale up their profits relative to other types of companies. Every $1 in shareholders' equity at Apple, for instance, translates into a comparatively modest $2.50 worth of assets.
Cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35% down to 15% would therefore be a boon for Bank of America. It would have reduced the North Carolina-based bank's tax liability in 2016 by nearly half, or 48%, leaving $3.5 billion in additional net income to hit the bank's bottom line. That would make a huge difference, boosting Bank of America's net income by 19%, or approximately $0.35 per share.

The challenge for investors right now, however, is that much of this already appears to be priced into Bank of America's stock. This explains why its shares are up 44% since the beginning of November. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is up only 13% over the same stretch, while the KBW Bank Index has climbed 24% -- the latter tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo.
If Trump's tax plans don't come to fruition -- and that could very well be the case, given the impact of the cuts on the federal deficit -- bank stocks could be in for a correction. It's too early to say if that will happen, but investors in bank stocks should keep it in the back of their minds.

Q: I know I should invest the majority of my 401(k) in stocks, but what are the differences among all of the stock funds offered by my 401(k) plan?
Your fund offerings probably have their own unique brand names, but in your plan's literature, there are some common descriptive terms you'll find such as ""small-cap growth"" or ""large-cap blend."" Here's what these terms mean.
The first differentiation is growth or value. Growth funds invest in companies growing at a faster-than-average rate, whereas value funds seek to find undervalued, established companies. Generally speaking, growth stock funds are a bit more volatile, but also have the highest long-term return potential. Funds labeled ""blend"" invest in a combination of the two.
Next is the size of the companies the fund invests in, which is often listed as ""large-cap,"" ""mid-cap,"" or ""small-cap."" While there is no set-in-stone rule, large-cap companies are usually those with market capitalizations (values) of $10 billion or more, mid caps are companies worth between $2 billion and $10 billion, and small caps are companies worth less than $2 billion. The guideline is that the smaller the companies a fund invests in, the more volatile you should expect it to be.
Also, some of your funds may be labeled ""global,"" ""international,"" or ""emerging markets."" Most of your 401(k)'s funds are likely invested in domestic equities -- that is, stocks of U.S.-based companies. Global funds invest in companies in the U.S. as well as foreign countries around the world. International funds invest in foreign stocks, and specifically exclude the U.S. Emerging-market funds invest in stocks based in countries with developing economies, such as Brazil, China, and India. International exposure can provide an element of diversification to your retirement savings, and emerging markets can capture some of the volatile, but powerful, growth potential of developing economies.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/17/the-3-best-dividend-stocks-in-it-services.aspx,2017-05-17,"
The IT services industry is often considered a slow growth one which is saturated with competition and dogged by controversies over outsourcing and the use of H-1B visas. But despite those headwinds, the IT services industry is still growing -- research firm Gartner still sees global IT spending rising between 1% and 3% annually through the end of the decade.
Moreover, several IT services stocks have also become decent dividend plays for patient investors. Let's look at three of the top income plays within this challenging market -- IBM (NYSE:IBM), Accenture (NYSE:ACN), and Infosys (NYSE:INFY).

Image source: Getty Images.

IBM
IBM's biggest problem over the past few years is its lack of top-line growth. Its revenue has declined year over year for 20 straight quarters, and many top investors -- including Warren Buffett -- seem to be losing patience in its glacial turnaround efforts. The main challenge is that the growth of its stronger ""strategic imperatives"" (cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security) still isn't robust enough to offset ongoing declines at its legacy IT services, business software, and hardware businesses. 
But on the bright side, buybacks and cost-cutting initiatives are still lifting its earnings. That's why analysts expect Big Blue to still post 1% earnings growth this year and 2% growth next year. That bottom-line growth will also enable it to continue raising its dividend, which it has done annually for 22 straight years. The company's current forward yield of 4%, which is double the S&P 500's current yield, is also comfortably supported by a payout ratio of 46%.
Accenture
Accenture is generally considered to be one of IBM's biggest rivals in the IT services market. But unlike IBM, Accenture's growth isn't heavily weighed down by legacy business software and hardware products. As a result, Accenture's track record of growth is much better -- it's posted solid sales growth over the past few years, and Wall Street expects that trend to continue for the foreseeable future, with 5% sales growth this year and 7% sales growth next year. 
Much of that growth has been fueled by Accenture's strength in the financial sector, which has been bolstered by stabilizing interest rates and improving balance sheets. Boosted by buybacks, Accenture's earnings are expected to rise 10% this year and 9% next year. 
That earnings growth will enable Accenture to continue its seven-year streak of annual dividend increases. The company currently pays a forward yield of 2%, but its low payout ratio of 39% indicates that there's still plenty of room for future hikes. However, investors should note that Accenture pays a semi-annual dividend instead of a quarterly one.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-52965');
            });
        

Infosys
Indian IT services giant Infosys has been heavily targeted by critics of H-1B visas, but the company recently pledged to hire 10,000 American workers over the next two years. Despite those political headwinds, Infosys is still posting slow and steady growth. Its annual revenue has risen steadily over the past few years, and analysts expect its sales to grow another 7% this year and 8% next year.
Like Accenture, much of Infosys' top-line growth is attributed to the gradual recovery of the financial sector. During last quarter's conference call, VP and Financial Services Europe chief Mohit Joshi told analysts that he remained ""optimistic about financial services for the next 12 months."" Infosys isn't dependent on buybacks as IBM and Accenture are, but analysts still expect its earnings to grow 3% this year and 7% next year. 
Infosys' four-year streak of annual dividend hikes isn't impressive, but its forward yield of 2.5% is higher than Accenture's. Its low payout ratio of 40% also gives it plenty of room for future hikes, but it also pays semi-annual dividends instead of quarterly ones.
But which of these three stocks is the best play?
The IT services industry currently has an average trailing P/E of 19. IBM's P/E of 12 and Infosys' P/E of 16 remain well below that average, while Accenture's ratio of 20 is slightly higher. 
IBM might look like the cheapest play, but investors should also remember that it has the lowest growth potential. Infosys also looks cheap, but it also reportedly relies the most heavily on H1-B visas -- so any regulatory changes could wreak havoc on its earnings growth. Therefore, I believe that Accenture is the safest of these three plays -- although its dividend yield is the lowest.

After enduring their worst single-day drop so far in 2017 yesterday, U.S. stocks traded modestly higher on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 56 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fared slightly better, rising 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively. Together with news that unemployment claims decreased by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000 last week, investors today were cautiously considering the implications of the Justice Department's appointment of former F.B.I. director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the investigation of ties between President Trump's campaign and Russia.
But zooming in a bit, a few individual stocks delivered outsized gains for investors today, including Pandora Media (NYSE:P), athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN), and Veritiv Corporation (NYSE:VRTV). Read on to learn what caused these unusual pops.

PANDORA'S NEW PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE. IMAGE SOURCE: PANDORA MEDIA.

Pandora Media buyout rumors swirl
Shares of Pandora rose 5.5% today after the New York Post reported that SiriusXM has recently renewed talks to acquire the music-streaming specialist. NYP elaborated that the two companies haven't agreed on a price just yet, but cautioned that sources familiar with the situation believed some predictions for a buyout at $12 to $13 per share may be too optimistic. After drifting lower on the heels of its latest quarterly report on May 8, 2017, Pandora stock closed today at $9.41 per share.
Of course, that would be disappointing for investors considering The Wall Street Journal has previously reported that Pandora rebuffed a $15-per-share offer from Sirius XM parent Liberty Media last year. But this also shouldn't be surprising considering that, along with its quarterly report last week, Pandora announced new governance measures and an independent committee to focus on maximizing shareholder value, including extending its review of strategic alternatives.
Athenahealth attracts activist interest
Athenahealth stock climbed 22.4% today after a new SEC filing showed activist investor Elliott Associates now holds a 9.2% stake in the cloud-based healthcare services specialist.
Keeping in mind Athenahealth plunged following its disappointing first-quarter report in April, Elliott Associates voiced its belief that shares of Athenahealth are ""significantly undervalued and represent an attractive investment opportunity."" Elliot Associates further stated that Athenahealth ""operates in a highly strategic area at the intersection of technology and healthcare with a disruptive value proposition, a leading competitive position and a compelling product set, the value of which is not reflected in [its] current market value.""
But perhaps most intriguing for Athenahealth investors today, Elliott may also propose changes, including a shakeup of the company's board, a strategic review, or a potential sale.

Veritiv scores an upgrade
Finally, Veritiv stock climbed 12.6% today after Wells Fargo upgraded shares of the business-to-business packaging company. More specifically, Wells Fargo analyst Christopher Manuel upgraded Veritiv to outperform from market perform, and simultaneously increased his per-share price target to $47 from $45. Veritiv shares closed today at $45.
To explain his bullishness, Manuel pointed to favorable demand trends for Veritiv's core packaging and facility solutions segments, and further believes the company should be able to reach the high end of its $200 million to $225 million goal for synergies in 2018 stemming from the merger which formed the company in 2014.
With Veritiv shares still down more than 16% year to date -- primarily thanks to its painful first-quarter 2017 report earlier this month -- it's no surprise to see some on Wall Street stepping back in.

Sometimes, winners just keep on winning. This has been the underlying theme for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) so far in 2017. Often collectively referred to as FANG stocks, these four stocks have absolutely trounced the market this year, adding to their huge outperformance in recent years.
Here's a close look at these stocks' recent performance, as well as a glimpse at what has been driving their stocks higher, some reasons to be cautious, and what investors should make of these surging stock prices.

Image source: Getty Images.

FANG stocks' mind-boggling performance
Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet stocks are up about 30%, 29%, 28%, and 21%, respectively, year to date. These returns leave the S&P 500's 7% rise during this period in the dust.

FB data by YCharts.
Furthermore, these stocks' big gains in 2017 extend an extraordinary track record for each in recent years. Facebook's, Amazon's, Netflix's, and Alphabet's stock prices are up about 150%, 220%, 220%, and 80%, respectively, compared to three years ago. During this same period, the S&P 500 increased just 27%.
Here's a quick look at each stock.
Facebook
Catalysts: Facebook's surging stock price comes as the company's revenue and earnings per share are soaring, driven by strong advertiser demand and continued growth in users. In Facebook's most recent quarter, revenue soared 49% year over year, and earnings per share jumped 73%. The social network's monthly active users were up 17% year over year.
Risks: Management has been warning investors that Facebook's revenue growth rates are about to come down meaningfully as the social network laps strong comparisons. It expects increasing ad loads to no longer serve as a key catalyst for revenue growth. If growth rates come down faster than investors are expecting, the stock's premium valuation could get a haircut.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-57165');
            });
        

Amazon
Catalysts: Amazon continued to impress investors in 2017, as the company's earnings per share came in significantly above analyst estimates for both quarterly earnings reports published during the year. Higher-than-expected profitability has primarily been driven by Amazon's fast-growing cloud services business, which accounts for the bulk of Amazon's operating profits.
Risks: Amazon continues to display an appetite for aggressive investments, even if this means margins take a hit in the near term. While this is the very strategy that has helped fortify the company's market share gains and competitive advantages today, it's always possible that today's investments won't pay off as handsomely in the future as past investments have.
Netflix
Catalysts: Netflix has been proving to investors it can not only continue growing its subscriber base rapidly, but also achieve meaningful profitability while it's at it. For instance, the streaming-TV leader reported its first-ever consolidated profit in its international segment in the first quarter, as mature markets in the segment offset investments in newer international markets. In addition, Netflix's earnings per share for the quarter was $0.40, up significantly from $0.06 in the year-ago quarter.
Risks: Investors shouldn't expect Netflix's sudden profitability overseas to stick around. The company is already projecting a small loss in Q2 for its international segment as it invests aggressively in newer markets.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-57331');
            });
        

Alphabet
Catalysts: Alphabet's revenue and earnings have recently increased nicely, with both coming in ahead of analyst expectations in the first quarter of 2017. The company's strong business growth has been driven primarily by mobile search and YouTube. Furthermore, Alphabet's other revenues segment is also benefiting, thanks to growing revenue from the Android app store, Google-branded hardware, and cloud services.
Risks: Alphabet's ""other bets"" segment, which includes some of the company's ""moonshot"" side businesses like Nest, Verily, and Fiber, may account for a small portion of Alphabet's revenue, but it's weighing pretty heavily on overall operating income. The segment lost $855 million in the first quarter of 2017, worse than a $774 million loss in the year-ago quarter. If Alphabet can't turn some of these other bets into winners, the segment could drag on results.

What should investors do? 
Beyond these fundamental risks for each stock, all four of these companies are up against a common and unforgiving foe: high expectations. Investors have priced sustained, high levels of growth into all four of these stocks' valuations. So investors would be wise to take the time to fully understand what these companies will need to do to live up to their valuations.
Investors shouldn't automatically conclude it's time to sell just because of these stocks' recent sharp increases and their pricey valuations. I don't believe investors interested in these stocks are too late to the game. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet continue to benefit from their strong competitive positions in their respective markets, and their underlying businesses look stronger than ever.
Of course, investors should expect volatility. Given the significant growth expectations baked into these companies' valuations, a slight shift in sentiment about their long-term prospects could spark large swings in their stock prices. On the other hand, if investors continue to wait for these market leaders' stocks to fall to bargain territory, they might miss out entirely.
Ultimately, even after an impressive start to 2017, FANG stocks continue to look like the sort of companies investors should want in their portfolios over the next 10 years.

http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/05/22/8-facts-about-your-401k-every-baby-boomer-should-k.aspx,2017-05-22,"
Baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, aren't spring chickens anymore. If you're a baby boomer, you're somewhere between your mid-50s and early 70s -- and you're either in retirement or not very far away from it.
Thus, retirement savings and retirement income should be of paramount importance to you, and you may want to be making the most of any 401(k) plan available to you. Here are eight facts about 401(k) plans that baby boomers need to know. 

Image source: Getty Images.

A 401(k) can be critical to your retirement
While our parents and grandparents may have had pension income count on in retirement, pensions have grown more scarce in recent decades. It's up to most of us to provide much of the income we'll need in retirement. Social Security will probably play a critical role, but on average, it will provide only about 40% of our pre-retirement income. If your earnings were below average, it will provide a higher percentage, but if your earnings were above average, you can expect less than 40% of your pre-retirement income.
A 401(k) account, perhaps in tandem with an IRA or two, can be a big help in saving for retirement. One reason is that 401(k) plans typically feature free money from your employer, in the form of matching funds. A common employer match is 50% of the contributions you make up to 6% of your salary. So if you earn $70,000 and contribute 6%, or $4,200, your employer will add another $2,100. That's $2,100 of free money and a guaranteed 50% return on your investment that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else.
401(k)s have generous contribution limits
While the current contribution limit for IRAs is $5,500, plus a $1,000 ""catch-up"" contribution for those 50 or older, limits for 401(k) accounts are much more generous. For 2017, you can contribute up to $18,000 to your 401(k), plus an additional $6,000 if you're 50 or older -- for a possible total of $24,000!

You can amass a huge retirement war chest with a 401(k)
A 401(k) account can help you accumulate a lot of money for retirement, which will probably be very helpful when you're no longer working. The table below shows how effective it is to make big annual contributions and to do so for as many years as possible.

There are Roth 401(k) accounts
Many people aren't aware of it, but just as there are two main kinds of IRAs -- traditional and Roth -- many companies now offer their workers two different kinds of 401(k)s, also traditional and Roth. With a traditional IRA and 401(k), you contribute pre-tax money that reduces your taxable income and, therefore, your tax bill for the year. When you withdraw the money in retirement, it's taxed as ordinary income to you. With the Roth IRA and 401(k), you contribute post-tax money that doesn't deliver any upfront tax break. But you eventually get a big tax break when you withdraw from the account in retirement  because if you follow the rules, you get to take all the money out of the account tax-free.

            });
        

401(k)s have downsides
Of course, 401(k) plans, like most things, aren't perfect. For example, they offer limited menus of investment choices, such as a handful of mutual funds. By contract, most IRA accounts let you invest in just about any stock and choose among hundreds or even thousands of mutual funds.
Then there are fees, which many 401(k) investors are hardly even aware of. That's a problem, because they can sometimes be quite hefty, and even when they seem small, they can do meaningful damage to your ultimate results. (Indeed, some plans charge big fees even for index funds that you can invest in elsewhere for a pittance.)
A Wall Street Journal article earlier this year noted that, ""According to Vanguard Group, investors in a plan that charged 0.25% a year could in theory amass 20% more money over a four-decade career than they could in one that charged 1.25%, all else being equal."" A Department of Labor report offers a starker example:

Assume that you are an employee with 35 years until retirement and a current 401(k) account balance of $25,000. If returns on investments in your account over the next 35 years average 7% and fees and expenses reduce your average returns by 0.5%, your account balance will grow to $227,000 at retirement, even if there are no further contributions to your account. If fees and expenses are 1.5%, however, your account balance will grow to only $163,000. The 1% difference in fees and expenses would reduce your account balance at retirement by 28%.

Fortunately, the trend is in the workers' favor, as fees have been falling in recent years, in part because of lawsuits brought about against some employers. In the meantime, you can look up ratings for many companies' 401(k) plans at www.brightscope.com -- where it rates them on fees, among other things.

There are withdrawal rules to follow
In most cases, you won't be able to withdraw money from your 401(k) until age 59 1/2. Take money out before then and you'll probably face a 10% early withdrawal penalty. There's an exception, though: If you leave your job in the year that you turn 55 or later, the 10% penalty won't apply. Retiring early because of a qualifying disability can also free you from the penalty, as can a few other circumstances, such as financial hardship.
If you're in no hurry to withdraw money, know that you can't delay doing so forever. A 401(k) account, whether traditional or Roth, features ""required minimum distributions"" (RMDs). According to the IRS, RMDs are generally required to begin on ""April 1 following the later of the calendar year in which you reach age 70 1/2 or retire."" (Note that traditional IRAs also feature RMDs, and you can't delay them by delaying retiring.) Withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) will be counted as taxable income to you, while Roth 401(k) withdrawals should be tax-free, as contributions to a Roth 401(k) are made with taxed money.

There are some big 401(k) mistakes to avoid
If you're saving aggressively in a 401(k) account, that's great! Don't make some common blunders, though, lest you hurt your financial future. For example, don't be one of the many people who cash out their 401(k) account every time they change jobs. Sure, you may have only worked at a given company for three years and may not have much in your account, but if you remove even $20,000 that could have kept growing for you for another 25 years, you could lose out on about $137,000 retirement dollars (assuming an 8% average annual growth rate). Similarly, don't borrow from a 401(k) plan, either, unless it's an emergency and you really have no better option. That's another way of stealing from your financial future.
Finally, don't keep most of your money in the stock of your employer. Yes, you know that company best, but remember that it's already providing most or all of your income now. To have it provide most of your future income, too, is putting a lot of eggs in that one basket. Remember -- even great companies can fall on prolonged hard times -- or can defy expectations and fail. Try not to keep too much of your net worth in company stock -- perhaps not more than 10%, at most.
Some investments are better than others
Once you're socking money away in your 401(k) account, invest it effectively. 401(k) plans typically feature default investment choices, and they tend to be conservative low-risk-low-return ones that won't serve you well if you're young and may not be great if you're older, either. Make sure that you decide how your 401(k) money will be invested.
Index funds are a terrific investment choice for 401(k) money, as long as they're low-fee ones focused on the broad market, such as the S&P 500 or the total U.S. or world stock market. They will probably outperform most managed stock mutual funds. There are bond index funds, too.
Your 401(k) account can be a vital part of your future financial security, so don't be afraid to seek the guidance of a financial advisor, if you don't have much confidence in your own money management skills. He or she may be able to help you set up your 401(k) (and other investments) in the most effective way.

Are you tired of dividend raises yet?
If the answer is ""yes,"" 2017 just isn't your year. We've been inundated with increases from companies both new to them and from veteran lifters. Our three chosen raisers from last week are more in the latter category, with one even gracing the hallowed dividend aristocrats list.

Clorox
A familiar name on the grocery aisle or in the cabinet under the sink, Clorox (NYSE:CLX) has bumped its quarterly payout 5% higher to $0.84 per share.
That wasn't much of a surprise, since the company is the aforementioned dividend aristocrat -- one of the market's few companies that has lifted its payout at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years running. Clorox has upped its dividend each and every year since 1977.
2017 has been quite good to the company. In February, the company posted Q2 results that showed pleasing year-over-year growth in net sales (by 4% to almost $1.48 billion), while net profit comfortably exceeded analyst projections. The Q3 numbers weren't as impressive, but Clorox is still estimating growth on both the top and bottom lines for the entirety of fiscal 2017; 3% to 4% for the former, and 7% to 9% for per-share earnings.
The company's operating and free cash flow figures have been on the decline lately, although not at a level steep enough to cause concern. In its two most recent fiscal years it spent slightly more than its FCF on dividends and share buybacks -- however, this was offset by proceeds from the sale of stock. 

CLX Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts
Clorox is an effective manager of its cash; that, plus the anticipated higher profitability, should allow it to remain an aristocrat. Expect those dividend raises to continue.
Clorox's upcoming payout will be dispensed on Aug. 4 to stockholders of record as of July 19. At the most recent closing share price, it would yield 2.6%. That's higher than the current 1.9% of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500. 
Tractor Supply Company
Specialty retailer Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) is about to hand back a bit more cash from its register. The company announced a nearly 13% lift in its quarterly dividend to $0.27 per share.
The news came several weeks after Tractor Supply released its Q1 2017 results, which revealed an encouraging 7% year-over-year rise in net revenue (to $1.56 billion). This was due to higher store count, however; more revealingly, comparable-store sales dipped by 2%. Meanwhile, net income declined by 7% to land at just under $68 million. 
The company ascribed the drops to ""challenging"" weather conditions, which were worse than the previous year (this was not unexpected -- 2016 saw an early spring). The relatively uglier conditions kept customers in its northern regions away from the stores. 
Still, Tractor Supply is (for the moment, anyway) estimating growth in ""comps"" for the full year of 2% to 3%, and a consequent 2% to 5% lift in net income. That should help goose cash flow, but if I were a shareholder I'd be concerned about the company's spendthrift ways -- it tends to shell out more than its annual free cash flow on dividends and buybacks, after all.

TSCO Total Dividends Paid (Annual) data by YCharts
Tractor Supply's freshly raised dividend is to be paid on June 6 to shareholders of record as of May 22. It would yield 1.8% at the current stock price.

Brink's
Brink's (NYSE:BCO)takes the prize for highest-percentage dividend raise out of our three stocks for this installment. The veteran cash security services operator is hoisting its quarterly payout 50% higher, to $0.15 per share.
The company also said its board has authorized a new $200 million stock buyback program.
As is its habit in recent quarters, Brink's topped analyst estimates for profitability in its recently reported Q1. Adjusted net income nearly doubled on a year-over-year basis, hitting $29 million. At $0.57 per share, that well exceeded the average analyst estimate.
Revenue also went north, rising by 7% to $740 billion. The company said it managed to improve its top line in all three of its geographic segments; this, mixed with cost savings, made for a potent combination.
Brink's anticipates more improvements in both line items going forward; its ambitious three-year strategic plan counts on 20% annual operating profit growth (to $325 million) between now and then.
This is a company guided by sharp, determined management. That extends to how it handles its cash flow, which is conservative and prudent (if not necessarily generous with dividend payouts). Free cash flow has been more than sufficient to cover the company's dividend, and should remain so even with that 50% raise and the new share repurchase initiative.

BCO Total Return Price data by YCharts
Brink's will hand out its next dividend on June 1 to investors of record as of May 18. The new distribution would yield just under 1%.
The company's stock repurchase program terminates on Dec. 31, 2019.

As for individual stocks, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) made big moves following the companies' quarterly earnings reports.

Snap's user growth disappoints
In the wake of Snap's first quarterly announcement as a public company, investors pushed the stock down 21%, as sales and user growth failed to meet Wall Street's high expectations. Revenue soared, rising nearly 300% from a tiny base of just $38.8 million in the year-ago period. Net losses ballooned to $2.2 billion, though, thanks to stock-based compensation charges tied to the social media specialist's March IPO. On an adjusted basis, losses roughly doubled to $188.2 million from $93.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Both the top- and bottom-line figures came in below consensus estimates.
Snap managed a solid boost in average revenue per user, but it added just 8 million new users during the quarter to land at 166 million daily active users. That marked the third consecutive quarter of slowing user growth, with the expansion pace falling to 36% from 48% in the prior quarter and 62% in the third quarter of 2016.
It's far too early to judge whether the company's new advertising platform will be a success. And as the base of picture and video fans increases, it's only natural that the growth rate will slow over time. However, investors had higher hopes that Snap would aggressively add to its user base even as it scales up its ad-based monetization plans.

Pegasystems returns to strong sales gains
Shares of business management software specialist Pegasystems jumped 10% following surprisingly strong first-quarter results. The company announced sales growth of 25%, which was its first acceleration in a year and also its best expansion pace in over five years. Profitability improved, too, as net income soared 160% to $27 million.
""We got off to a strong start in 2017,"" CEO Alan Trefler said in a press release, ""and we're happy with our performance globally.""

Image source: Pegasystems.

Pegasystems is benefiting from a shift away from perpetual software licenses to term-based cloud subscriptions. That move has lowered sales growth recently, but promises to generate more predictable revenue gains ahead.
Quarterly growth numbers can swing wildly based on the timing of a few big contracts, and that's likely the reason why executives didn't change their forecast, which predicts a 15% revenue improvement for the full year. Meanwhile, Pegasystems has its work cut out for it as it battles for market share in the competitive customer relationship management segment that's home to deep-pocketed leaders like salesforce.com.
Its sales team has solid momentum at its back right now, though, heading into the company's huge technology conference in early June, where Pegasystems likely will show off new productivity offerings while aiming to broaden its customer base.

When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched Apple Watch in April 2015, many analysts believed that it would turn the niche market of smartwatches into a mainstream one. Yet initial shipments missed expectations, and the wearables market remained a specialty one, splintered between low-end fitness trackers, midrange sports performance devices, and pricier smartwatches.
But according to research firm IDC, that market is still growing. IDC recently reported that shipments of all wearable devices worldwide rose 16.9% year over year to 33.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, with Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), Xiaomi, Apple, Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) and Samsung leading the market.

Data source: IDC. Chart by author.

IDC reports that only Fitbit and Garmin posted declines during the quarter. Xiaomi's market share grew more than 6 percentage points on sales of its cheap Mi Band devices in China. Meanwhile, Apple benefited from the launch of its Watch Series 2 last September, and Samsung gained ground with its Gear S3 Classic and Frontier devices.
However, the rest of the market remains fragmented, with smaller players all vying for a piece of the pie. But there's still room for these companies to grow -- IDC estimates that worldwide wearables shipments will rise from 102.4 million in 2016 to 213.6 million in 2020.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/11/3-cheap-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now.aspx,2017-05-11,"
With the post-crisis bull market entering its eighth year, finding value stocks to buy is becoming increasingly difficult, especially among traditionally expensive technology stocks.
However, potential bargains exist in certain pockets of the technology sector. To that end, let's examine the investing thesis for value stocks such as International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
International Business Machines
If you're in search of a fire sale, look no further than enterprise tech giant IBM. As a result of multi-year revenue declines, Big Blue's stock trades at 13 times its last 12 months' (LTM) EPS and 11 times next year's estimated EPS. In contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 25 times earnings. Similarly, IBM's 3.5% dividend yield stands well above the S&P 500's 1.9%. 
However, the rock-bottom valuation also reflects investor sentiment over the ongoing pivot of IBM's business model. CEO Ginni Rometty has been moving IBM away from using hardware sales to drive software and consulting services and moving the company toward becoming a cloud and analytics business. IBM has made commendable progress on this front: Next-gen growth businesses accounted for 42% of Big Blue's sales over the past 12 months.

Image source: IBM 

However, the fact that sales have declined for 20 straight quarters suggests that IBM's business pivot will only replace business it's currently losing, rather than meaningfully expanding its financial footprint -- hence the no-growth valuation. But if IBM can indeed return to growth mode in the medium to longer term, investors could do well by purchasing this cheap stock today.
Cisco Systems
Routing kingpin Cisco Systems doesn't sell at quite the discount to the market IBM does, but its still-cheap valuation makes it, too, a candidate for value investors interested in the tech sector. Cisco stock trades at 17 times LTM earnings and 13 times forward estimates, and as with IBM, this discount to the market reflects Cisco's issues maintaining its growth. Its sales are expected to contract 1.8% this year, for instance. Also like IBM, Cisco shareholders are paid to wait, being offered a nice 3.4% dividend yield. The company recently raised its dividend 11.5%, which maintains its streak of annual dividend increases since it initiated cash distributions in 2011.

Cisco also sees a compelling growth opportunity in the Internet of Things. The company believes the number of connected devices, which will rely on the types of hardware Cisco makes to communicate, will explode from 18 billion now to 400 billion by 2027. Should this heady growth estimate prove even remotely accurate, Cisco ought to experience a significant uptick in demand for its routers, which makes this tech giant an intriguing stock for investors seeking both income and earnings growth over the long term.

Apple
Finally, tech giant Apple remains a value stock even amid its soaring stock price. Its shares have rallied 53% over the past 12 months -- the only stock to outperform the Nasdaq Composite in the past year -- yet its shares still remain undervalued.

AAPL data by YCharts
Apple's massive cash hoard that masks the company's true business value. The Mac maker carried $158.3 billion in net cash and investments -- that is, total cash and investments after deducting all debt and commercial paper -- on its balance sheet as of its May 2 earnings report. 
Deducting that $158.3 billion from Apple's current $768.8 billion market cap implies a $610.5 billion value for the core business. Divided by the $45.7 billion in net income Apple has produced over the past four quarters, Apple's business alone trades at a real value of 13.3 times trailing earnings.
The company has plenty going for it. It's set to launch a fully redesigned iPhone later this fall to commemorate the device's 10th anniversary. As an estimated 31% of iPhones will be over two years old at that point, we could see another massive upgrade cycle, similar to that of the iPhone 6.
Between its value and growth potential, Apple is one of the more attractive cheap tech stocks on the market today. 
",3 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/17/3-top-printed-circuit-board-stocks-to-buy-in-2017.aspx,2017-05-17,"
Printed circuit board stocks have been very kind to investors lately. It is almost impossible to find a ticker in this sector that hasn't been beating the S&P 500 market tracker over the last 52 weeks.
How do you pick the top names in this broadly lucrative industry? I'm here to show you my three favorites in the printed circuit board market: Sanmina (NASDAQ:SANM), Benchmark Electronics (NYSE:BHE), and TTM Technologies (NASDAQ:TTMI), each one tailor-made for a different type of investor.
Read on to see what I mean.

Image source: Getty Images.

The towering giant
Sanmina's annual revenues are larger than TTM's and Benchmark's total sales put together. Printed circuit boards are a small component in this electronics manufacturing giant's global empire, with 45,000 employees spread out over 25 countries and six continents.
The company is among the world's largest circuit board manufacturers, but it consumes most of these materials in the process of putting together shelf-ready products for its customers. Sanmina does sell a small amount of printed circuit boards, cables, and other components directly to other electronics manufacturers and other clients, charging a small markup for these contracts.
Components and products produced 26% of Sanmina's gross profits over the last six months, culled from just 20% of the company's total sales.
The stock trades at just 13.6 times trailing earnings, and Sanmina investors have enjoyed a 49% return over the last year. Book-to-bill ratios stand at 1.1 today, which is a sign of revenue growth coming down the order pipeline. If you want safety and stability, this is your printed circuit board stock.

The over-achieving cash machine
Like Sanmina, Benchmark Electronics makes most of its hay from electronics manufacturing services. Benchmark may not be able to match Sanmina's economies of scale, but it's an extremely efficient cash machine.
The company produced free cash flows of $241 million in the last four quarters, based on $2.3 billion in top-line sales. That works out to a 10.5% cash margin, far above Sanmina's 3.1%.
Moreover, Benchmark has been growing its cash profits steadily in the last three years. The company is pursuing even wider gross profit margins by doubling down on opportunities in the medical, industrial, and sensor markets. Benchmark's highest-margin divisions grew their sales in 2016, while the less profitable computing and telecommunications segments swooned.
Benchmark should continue to raise large cash profits out of modest revenues. The stock is trading at just 4.4 times trailing free cash flows, making it an attractive target for investors with an eye for strong cash generation.

The bottom-line growth story
Finally, TTM Technologies is the purest play on circuit boards you'll find anywhere. The market is fragmented, and many of its rivals include printed circuit boards as part of a diverse strategy, like Sanmina and Benchmark. But it's all TTM does. Hidden in the name is another clue to TTM's unique market position, focusing on quick ""time to market"" delivery of circuit board orders.
That strategy puts TTM at the vanguard of pretty much every technology sea change. This is where you go when you want to be first to market with a game-changing consumer product or military tool. The company was a major supplier to cell phone and tablet makers when those products categories were new and exciting. Today, TTM is exploring fresh vistas in automotive computing, with continued support from the smartphone market.
The billion-dollar merger with rival Viasystems in 2015 gave TTM's revenues an overnight boost while adding the target company's roster of auto makers to TTM's customer Rolodex. That deal looks more prescient than ever, as automotive computing slides deeper into the mainstream.
TTM's share prices have more than doubled in 52 weeks, but they still trade at less than 9 times forward earnings estimates and roughly 7 times trailing free cash flows. This company is going places, taking investors along for an enriching ride.

",3 Top Printed Circuit Board Stocks to Buy in 2017
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/18/3-great-reasons-to-sell-gamestop-corp-stock.aspx,2017-05-18,"
Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) have shed over a third of their value in the past three years, as shifting industry trends take their toll on this brick-and-mortar retail business.
But even with the stock trading at just 7 times trailing earnings -- investors may still be best served by avoiding the company.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. Plunging sales 
GameStop revenue fell 8.1% to $8.6 billion in 2016, driven by an 11% drop in comparable store sales.
The decline accelerated in the fourth quarter, as the company's total global sales tumbled 13.6% on a 16.3% plunge in comps. In the U.S. -- GameStop's largest market by far -- comps actually fell 20.8%.
GameStop attributed the drop to weak sales of recent video game releases and ""aggressive console promotions"" from competing retailers during the holiday shopping season. In turn, fourth-quarter new software sales decreased by 19.3% and new hardware sales plunged 29.1%.
Despite these significant challenges, there is an even more powerful force at play: the shift to digital distribution.
2. The digital evolution
As the world's largest gaming retail chain, GameStop is wholly exposed to the growing popularity of digital downloads.
Major video game publishers like Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts are moving toward full-scale digital distribution, which offers higher margins than the sale of physical game discs. In fact, Activision's digital sales soared 50% year over year to a record of $1.39 billion in the first quarter and compromised 80% of total revenue. Electronic Arts' most recent results were likewise fueled by strong digital growth, with 61% of its fiscal fourth quarter net revenue coming from digital game sales, compared with 55% in the prior-year period.
Console companies such as Microsoft are also making a push toward increased digital content. The tech titan recently announced a subscription service that gives Xbox One owners access to over 100 older titles. GameStop fell hard on the news, as many investors see this as a direct threat to the company's large pre-owned/value game business, which accounted for more than 46% of its gross profit in 2016.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-71101');
            });
        

3. It's about to get worse
Beyond the shift to digital sales, GameStop is about to face another fearsome threat: Amazon.com, which is positioning itself to become a bigger player in video games.
The e-commerce giant has established a beachhead in the industry by offering its millions of Prime members a 20% discount for new video game releases. That's a powerful advantage over GameStop, which typically sells new games at the full retail price.
And now, Amazon has begun placing ""buy"" buttons on its massively popular Twitch game-streaming site. This will make it even easier for the roughly 100 million people who visit Twitch each month to purchase games directly from Amazon.
Valuation isn't everything
It's understandable that value hunters would be attracted to GameStop and its bargain basement P/E ratio of just 7 times, especially when the S&P 500 average is about 24. The generous 6.4% dividend yield is also going to be tempting to a lot of income investors, as it more than triples the yield of the S&P.
But much like beautiful sirens luring sailors to their doom, those figures fail to tell the whole story. If the company's earnings and cash flow deteriorate in the face of the continued digital disruption of its business, its stock may be far more expensive than its current valuation would suggest. And the dividend could ultimately prove unsustainable at these levels. In turn, it's possible -- some would say likely -- that GameStop shareholders end up suffering major losses in the years ahead. As innovation in the video game world powers on, investors may wish to consider selling their GameStop shares and look elsewhere.

",3 Great Reasons to Sell GameStop Corp. Stock
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/14/apple-inc-stock-hits-new-high-buy-sell-or-hold.aspx,2017-05-14,"
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock hit yet another new high last week, with shares closing at slightly above $156. The week's gain puts shares up an impressive 69% in the past 12 months, and up 44% in the past six months alone.
Apple stock's big gain follows the tech giant's return to growth a few quarters ago, as well as greater investor confidence in the company's ability to continue growing its business.

Image source: Apple.

But with Apple stock trading so much higher, it's a good time to ask the all-important question: Is Apple stock still a buy at this level?
Bull case
The bull case for Apple is highlighted by the company's recent return to growth and its conservative valuation (Yes, Apple stock still trades conservatively even after its recent gains).
Apple's growth prospects are undoubtedly looking more favorable than they were last year. After reporting three quarters in a row of declining revenue in fiscal 2016, Apple has now reported two quarters in a row of year-over-year growth. Even more, Apple's growth in its most recent quarter actually accelerated compared to growth in the quarter before it. Revenue in fiscal Q2 was up 4.5% year over year and EPS was up 10.5% year over year. This compares to year-over-year growth for revenue and EPS in Q1 of 3.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Going forward, Apple expects growth to continue to accelerate. The midpoint of management's guidance for third-quarter revenue implied about 5% year-over-year growth.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-15330');
            });
        


In addition, despite Apple stock's soaring stock price recently, shares continue to trade conservatively. For instance, Apple stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 19. While this is well above the P/E ratio of about 10 Apple stock had one year ago, it's still handily below the average P/E ratio of about 24 of stocks in the S&P 500. Comparisons aside, Apple's long track record of fat profit margins and pricing power alone makes it easy to imagine the tech giant living up to this valuation.
Bear case
But one reason for investors to be cautious about investing in Apple is the company's undeniable dependence on its iPhone, which happens to also be a business segment that is showing signs of peaking.
While Apple's iPhone revenue in its most recent quarter increased 1% year over year, iPhone unit sales were down 1% during this same period. To be fair, Apple's iPhone 7 lineup marks the third generation in a row of new iPhones with the same general form factor. So, it's possible that some customers are holding out for a more significantly refreshed iPhone, which the ever-active Apple rumor mill believes is coming later this year -- just on time for the tenth anniversary of the important phone.
But here's where the risk to Apple's business is best understood: If iPhone sales do begin to decline in the future, this could be a major problem since the smartphone segment accounts for well over half of Apple's revenue. In Apple's most recent quarter, iPhone sales accounted for about 63% of total revenue.

Despite Apple stock's roaring gains recently, I'm going to continue siding with the bulls. Sure, I wouldn't put as much of my money on the stock today as I would a year ago, but I'm not planning to trim my position either. As long as Apple continues to demonstrate strong pricing power and earnings growth, a price-to-earnings ratio of 19 still seems compelling for this established leader.

At first it sounds interesting, maybe even fun. But then I'm left to think about the consequences. I worry that the SEC just made it easier for average Americans to treat their individual retirement accounts with all the care of a poker night bankroll.
A product that almost went extinct
As recently as December 2015, the SEC was pondering a rule change that would kill off the riskiest of leveraged funds. It planned to cap the use of derivatives, a key ingredient for creating leverage, so that ETFs would be effectively capped at 2X. Some SEC regulators, consumer advocates, and others feared that any more than 2X leverage is too much for ordinary investors.
They're probably right. The truth is that the primary problem with leveraged ETFs isn't with the funds themselves. They work just fine. The problem is that no one reads the warning labels hidden in thick prospectuses. In short, the danger is in how people think they work, rather than how they actually work.
A quirk in the math
In 2015, a 3X leveraged fund, ProShares Ultra Gold Miners, went public in a quiet debut. Less than two years later, the fund has crumbled, losing more than 38% of its value. Meanwhile, a fund that is designed to track the same index, but without leverage, is up 2% over the same period.
How does three times a 2% return equal a 38% loss?
Leveraged funds fail to produce leveraged returns of their index over the long haul because they are designed to generate the advertised return over a span of just one day. 
I created a scenario in which a leveraged fund generates 3X the daily return of an unleveraged fund over the course of a three-day period in the table below. While the leveraged fund does its job spectacularly over a single day's time, its returns start to deviate from the 3X return investors expect over longer periods, as daily compounding throws its returns off the path that many investors anticipate.

Source: Author. Numbers are for illustration only. 
Notice that the daily returns of the 3X fund are exactly equal to three times the return of the traditional unleveraged fund. However, when the returns are calculated over the full three-day period, the 3X fund actually ended up amplifying the return of the unleveraged fund by 3.11 times, returning negative 9.52% compared to the 3.06% loss of the unleveraged fund.
This isn't an anomaly or mathematical error. If I were to extend the timeline further, the amplification would deviate even further from the 3X return many investors expect. It's a mathematical certainty. 
Of course, this isn't a failure of the product. The leveraged fund is providing exactly what it promises, which is a return equal to three times the daily return of this specific index. The problem is that the public doesn't bother to think about the daily part of the equation. Leveraged funds are only meant to be held for a short period of time, preferably a trading day or less.
But many investors dive in head first, thinking that if the market is expected to go up in value over time, then 3X must be so much better than 2X, or even 1X. And the leveraged fund industry is plenty happy to cater to their greed: Although these products are perhaps too speculative for individual investors, individuals are by far the industry's biggest customer.
A 2012 analysis by Deutsche Bank found that retail investors hold proportionally more leveraged funds than plain-vanilla ETFs. In fact, 85% of assets in 2X funds and 91% of assets in 3X funds were owned by retail investors. By contrast, retail investors own less than half of all assets in ordinary unleveraged ETFs.

Crafting a loophole
A rule by the name of Regulation T generally sets the standard for just how much leverage a retail investor can use to buy stock. Since 1974, the initial margin requirement has been set to 50%. Thus, to buy $1,000 of stock, an investor would have to pony up $500 of their own cash to secure a loan for the remaining $500 from their broker.
This rule generally protects individual investors from blowing up their accounts, while protecting brokers from undue losses in the event stocks crater. 
The genius of the leveraged fund is that it circumvents Regulation T rules on leverage. By purchasing a 4X leveraged fund, investors can take twice the risk that they would be allowed to take if they used margin to purchase a plain-vanilla ETF. Remember, Regulation T applies to leverage on brokerage accounts, not funds. It's really pretty brilliant. Put the leverage in the fund, not in the brokerage account, and charge a fat fee for your hard work.
Is 4X too much? Why not 5X or 8X? I'll admit there is no clear and obvious line to draw. Eliminating margin in the late 1940s was probably going too far. Allowing investors to leverage up at 10X in the years leading up to the Great Depression ended in obvious disaster we would be silly to repeat.
For what it's worth, only once has the S&P 500 come close to a one-day decline that would send a 4X leveraged fund to zero. That was in 1987, when the S&P 500 plunged 20.47% on a day forever known as Black Monday. If a 4X ETF were around then, it would have lost nearly 88% of its value in a single trading day.
Somewhat amusingly, ForceShares has minimally planned for a one-day disaster in which the S&P 500 declines by 25%. In a regulatory filing, it points out that it will purchase insurance in the form of put options, protecting itself and its investors from a complete loss.
But don't get your hopes up. Per its illustrative example, if the S&P 500 declines by 25% in a single day, investors would lose just 94% of their capital, rather than the 100% loss you might assume.
I suppose something is better than nothing.

Growth stocks are typically expected to grow at a faster clip than peers' stocks or the broader market. Their companies generally enjoy a competitive advantages and high earnings growth potential, which is also why such stocks are a great fit for investors who aren't worried about the day-to-day meanderings of the stock market and believe in investing in stocks with a long-term view toward building wealth.
As we Fools strongly believe in the buy-and-hold concept, three of our contributors have picked one growth stock each that they think deserves every long-term investor's attention today: Middleby (NASDAQ:MIDD), NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), and Under Armour (NYSE:UAA)(NYSE:UA). Here's what you need to know about each of these three stocks. 
Get cooking with this oven maker
Rich Duprey (Middleby): ""If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen."" That saying could apply to investors when it comes to Middleby. Although at first glance it would seem the commercial-oven maker is simmering along with its stock, having moved 27% higher over the past year and having quadrupled in value over the past five, bubbling beneath the surface is a failed acquisition that's weighing down its entry into the residential market and a weakening in its primary restaurant customers. Yet for investors who have the patience to not peer into the kettle to often to see whether the water's boiling yet, Middleby can be a good long-term investment.

The oven maker continues to see sales in its residential segment hurt by the 2012 acquisition of Viking, an oven company that had a sterling reputation for years only to allow itself to become beset with quality-control problems that materialized after Middleby bought it. Middleby is still dealing with the recall of 100,000 products, including ovens that would spontaneously ignite. In its just-issued first-quarter earnings report, segment sales fell 6% on a currency-adjusted basis in large part because of the recall.
In the commercial segment, adjusted sales were down almost 3% year over year, which it blamed on timing issues by its largest restaurant customers. The entire dining industry is suffering from a prolonged slump that has now stretched to five straight quarters. The last time it experienced such a contraction was just as the economy was emerging from the financial crisis in 2010. Middleby expects the segment to continue experiencing sluggishness for the immediate future.
Yet net earnings improved to $70.7 million in Middleby's first quarter, or an adjusted $1.26 per share, handily beating analyst expectations of $1.13 per share. The oven maker expects business to improve in the back half of the year, has introduced a new lineup of products, and is looking to the development of new food-processing facilities in emerging markets for future growth.
It also continues on a growth-by-acquisition strategy that, as the Viking episode shows, carries some risk, but as Middleby's longer experience indicates, it's largely able to do successfully. This oven maker remains a stock with good, long-term potential.
Invest in the future of energy
Neha Chamaria (NextEra Energy): I strongly believe long-term investors would do well investing in a utility stock that not only offers stability in terms of earnings and dividends but is also poised to benefit from future energy trends. One of my favorites is NextEra Energy, which is among North America's largest electric-power companies today.
While a highly regulated business should keep volatility in NextEra Energy's top line at bay, the company's intent focus on renewable energy should make way for growth in coming years. You might be surprised to know that NextEra Energy, together with its affiliates, is the world's largest provider of solar and wind energy today and also among the largest nuclear power operators.

The world's gradual shift to cleaner energy sources could open up big growth opportunities for NextEra Energy, which is exactly what long-term investors seek. The company is already growing steadily, having doubled its net profit margin in the past decade to 18% for 2016 and earning double-digit returns on equity all through. The outlook appears bright as well, what with management targeting adjusted EPS growth of 6%-8% through 2020. Investors can expect similar growth in dividends, given NextEra Energy's history of growing its dividends in line with adjusted earnings. With the stock yielding 2.9% currently and trading at a price-to-earnings of less than 17, which is below its five-year as well as industry average, I believe now is a great time for investors to consider NextEra Energy.

A company with big rebound potential
Keith Noonan (Under Armour): Footwear and apparel company Under Armour is going through a serious rough stretch and stands as one of the S&P 500's biggest losers over the last year, but investors with a long-term outlook now have a chance to buy into a company with great growth potential at a discount. Putting the company's 46% drop over the past year in perspective, slowing sales growth, weak domestic performance (year-over-year, American sales slipped 1% last quarter), and reduced revenue and earnings targets explain why the market has soured on the stock. However, there are good reasons to bank on a rebound. 
With roughly 80% of the company's sales coming from the domestic market, Under Armour still has tremendous growth opportunities overseas. Last quarter saw the company's international sales increase 52% year over year, and an expanding global middle class and the increasing popularity of football and basketball in key markets such as China point to big opportunities to expand the company's global footprint. 
Under Armour has built a strong brand backed by a compelling lineup of celebrity partners, and some of the problems that have weighed on performance -- such as softer-than-anticipated demand for its Steph Curry signature shoes, stemming from unpopular design choices -- appear to be short-term hurdles rather than foundation-level problems. Emerging categories such as connected fitness and growth in direct-to-consumer selling are also likely to be momentum drivers.
While the possibility certainly exists that the company and its stock will hit additional bumps in the road, Under Armour has great potential to grow its brand and business around the globe and stands out as a stock that long-term investors should give serious consideration. 
",3 Growth Stocks for Long-Term Investors
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/10/how-sustainable-is-ibms-dividend.aspx,2017-05-10,"
There isn't much positive news about IBM (NYSE:IBM) these days. Most recent headlines focus on Big Blue's 20th straight quarter of year-over-year sales declines or Warren Buffett's recent decision to sell about 30% of his shares. The stock has shed over a fourth of its value over the past five years -- a period in which the S&P 500 surged 75%.
But one key strength which keeps investors coming back is IBM's forward dividend yield of 3.9%, which is nearly double the S&P 500's current yield of 2%. That high yield, combined with a low P/E of 13 (compared to its industry average of 19), makes Big Blue look like a solid income play at current levels despite its lackluster growth.

But just how sustainable is IBM's dividend? To find out, let's examine the history of that dividend, its payout ratios, and the bottom line challenges Big Blue will face in the future.
Not a dividend aristocrat... yet
When a company raises its dividend annually for 25 straight years, it becomes an elite ""dividend aristocrat"", one of a group of stocks often favored by income investors. IBM is approaching that threshold with 22 straight years of dividend hikes. The company has also continually paid out dividends annually for over a century -- so that dividend won't fade away anytime soon.
Payout ratios
The easiest way to see if a company's dividend is sustainable is to check its payout ratio -- the percentage of its earnings or free cash flow which is spent on dividends. If either of those figures exceeds 100%, the dividend will likely be cut.
Over the past year, IBM spent 46% of its earnings and 47% of its free cash flow on dividends. Those low figures indicate that it still has plenty of room to raise its dividends. However, investors should still keep a close eye on IBM's cash flow -- which has been declining over the past few years due to its slowing growth and growing dependence on acquisitions.

            });
        

Revenue and earnings growth
IBM's top line growth has slowed down due to sluggish demand for its aging IT services, hardware, and software products. The company is trying to offset that slowdown by expanding five ""strategic imperatives"" (cloud, mobile, analytics, security, and social), but that growth still isn't strong enough to give Big Blue a top line gain. That's why Wall Street still expects IBM's revenue to drop 2% this year and stay roughly flat next year.
IBM's bottom line growth looks slightly better, due to buybacks, divestments of lower-margin businesses, various cost cutting strategies, and layoffs. As a result, analysts expect its earnings to improve 1% this year and 2% next year.
The catalysts and challenges
Looking ahead, IBM hopes that newer cloud-based services -- like the Watson AI platform and BlueMix cloud platform -- will help it catch up to public cloud platform leaders like Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. 
Amazon's AWS is the 800-pound gorilla in that market, with an annual run rate of nearly $15 billion. Microsoft doesn't disclose its exact revenue figures for Azure, but it reported that sales nearly doubled annually last quarter. Microsoft's total commercial cloud revenue (including SaaS products like Office 365 and Dynamics CRM) reached a run rate of over $15 billion at the end of the that quarter.
IBM claimed that its total cloud revenues (including public, hybrid, and private solutions) reached an annual run rate of $14.6 billion last quarter. It also noted that its strategic imperatives revenue accounted for 42% of its top line over the past 12 months. But as I already mentioned, that growth simply isn't enough to offset its weaker businesses yet. As a result, many analysts expect IBM to make additional acquisitions to strengthen those businesses as it divests weaker ones.

            });
        

So how sustainable is Big Blue's dividend?
IBM's growth might remain stagnant for at least another two years, but I believe that its steady earnings growth and low payout ratios still make it a very dependable income play for long-term investors. The stock's weak performance over the past few years is worrisome, but its low P/E should set a floor under the stock until the company's multi-year turnaround finally bears fruit.

Gold prices rose, and so the bullish bet on the precious metal, Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:JNUG), jumped 6% and recovered some of its year-to-date losses.
As for individual stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Fossil Group (NASDAQ:FOSL) attracted heavy investor interest following their quarterly earnings reports.

NVIDIA's accelerating sales gains
Expectations were high heading into NVIDIA's report, yet the chip specialist still managed to trounce them. Fiscal first-quarter revenue jumped 48% thanks in part to a near-tripling of its data center business. NVIDIA also managed strong growth in its core gaming segment and in the fast-growing auto division that's home to autonomous car driving technologies. Earnings outpaced sales growth as both gross and operating margins expanded, allowing non-GAAP net income to double to $533 million.

Executives focused their comments on the relatively small but attractive segments that appear set to power strong gains for NVIDIA's high-performance processors. ""The AI revolution is moving fast and continuing to accelerate,"" CEO Jensen Huang said in a press release. ""One industry after another is awakening to the power of GPU deep learning and AI, the most important technology force of our time,"" Huang added.
The company's second-quarter forecast called for sales to rise 36% to $1.95 billion, which edged past consensus estimates targeting $1.89 billion of revenue. With the stock's nearly 18% jump today, shares are now priced at over 45 times the past year's earnings. Yet NVIDIA continues to make a strong case for its premium valuation by putting up impressive operating results in a competitive industry.

Fossil's first-quarter loss
Fossil shares dove 20% after the watchmaker announced surprisingly weak quarterly results. Worldwide sales fell 12% as its industry continued to find itself victim to disruption from the tech world.

Demand for wearable tech timepieces, a tiny part of its business, surged. But that expansion wasn't nearly enough to offset plunging demand for Fossil's traditional products. Overall, watch sales fell 9% to push comparable sales down 11%. The company said it endured declines in all of its product categories and across all of its sales regions. Gross profit margin fell by 3 percentage points to 49.8%. Due to lower sales, Fossil's operating earnings fell from $14.4 million to a loss of $45.3 million.
While admitting challenges, management's comments didn't seem to squarely address the magnitude of the disruption the retailer now faces. ""Our results for the first quarter ... continue to reflect a challenging retail environment and a watch category undergoing significant change,"" CEO Kosta Kartsotis said in a press release.
Kartsotis and his team are ""very excited about the next generation of products"" they are preparing for release through the remainder of the year. However, the company lowered its 2017 sales forecast to a decline that ranges from 6% to 1.5% from the previous target of between a 6.5% slump and flat. Operating margin should be slightly better than initially feared, but that didn't cheer investors, given the prospect for further painful retailing losses ahead.

http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/05/18/should-i-repay-student-loans-faster-or-save-for-re.aspx,2017-05-18,"
Most of us know how important it is to save for retirement -- but setting aside 10% to 20% of every paycheck isn't easy, especially if you're paying off student debt. Young workers who are lucky enough to have some extra money left over at the end of the month may face a tough decision: to pay down their college debt faster, or to invest their spare cash in a retirement account. And their choice can have a major impact on their future finances. 
There are benefits to paying debt off early, like reducing your interest payments and relieving yourself of a financial burden. That said, funneling your money into student loan payments instead of a retirement account could shrink your ultimate retirement savings by much more than you realize.
Here are some things to think about before you make your next payment.

Image source: Getty Images.

The power of compounding
Let's play out a few scenarios for Jane Doe. Jane has an extra $1,000 per month after paying taxes, monthly bills, and her minimum student loan payment. She has $50,000 in student loans at a fixed interest rate of 5% on a 20-year loan schedule, so her minimum monthly payment is around $330. Here are a few scenarios that show how Jane could pay off her debt and how that would change the total interest she pays.

$7,693


$1,330 (minimum + $1,000)

Data source: Bankrate loan payment calculator.
Jane could save a lot of money by paying her loan off quicker -- but that could still be the wrong move. If Jane took the extra money she was paying into her student loan and instead put it in an investment account earning an average of 8% per year, her financial picture would look far different by the end of that 20-year loan period. Even if she didn't add anything else to her account for 20 years after that, she'd earn far more than she would have saved by paying off her student loan faster.

Data source: Bankrate simple saving calculator.
The benefits of saving for retirement early usually outweigh the benefits of paying more than the minimum on student loans. If Jane makes the minimum payment, she spends $24,702 more on interest, but she ends the loan period with $40,015 more in her retirement account -- a $15,000-plus difference that keeps compounding and growing down the line. However, not every situation is that simple; here are some other considerations to take into account. 
1. How much should I have in an emergency savings fund?
Before getting more aggressive about either paying down debt or investing for retirement, it's usually wise to set aside some cash in an emergency fund that could keep you afloat in case of a job loss or other unplanned emergency. The amount you should have in such a fund varies based on personal circumstance, but usually, a good rule of thumb is to have enough to cover six months of expenses.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-70341');
            });
        

2. Can I max out my employer's 401(k) match?
Many employers that offer a 401(k) retirement savings program will also match a certain percentage of your contribution into that program. For example, an employer might offer a 100% match of contributions up to 5% of the employee's salary, so that if the employee makes $50,000, and contributes 5% of their salary ($2,500 per year), then the employer will deposit $2,500 more into the account. Whatever type of match your company offers, these programs should usually be prioritized at least up to that match limit, since it's essentially free money -- a bonus on top of the employee's salary, and one that goes into a tax-advantaged account.
3. What are my interest rates?
One of the most important factors in the decision about whether to pay off debt faster or invest is the interest rate on the loan. In Jane's case, her 5% loan interest rate is substantially less than her expected 8% average annual return on her investments. While no one can guarantee any investing returns (more on this next), you do know your fixed loan interest rates, and you can calculate with precision how different payoff schedules would change the total amount you pay in interest.
However, that's not the case when the loan interest rate is variable, rather than fixed. Many lenders will offer a lower initial rate, but that rate could increase in the future. In the instance of a variable-rate student loan, it might make sense to explore a consolidation that could change that to a fixed-interest loan.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-84582');
            });
        

4. Can I stay long-term minded?
No one can say with certainty how much their investments will earn. Still, when you invest with a time horizon of decades -- i.e., don't day-trade, but buy stocks with the intention of holding them for many years to come -- you can feel pretty good about your odds of profiting when you look at historical trends.
The S&P 500, often used as a benchmark for the broad market, has, on average, risen 9.5% annually since 1928, 10% annually since 1967, and 7% annually since 2007, a period that includes the major recession of 2008. The market experiences up and downs, but over long periods of time, its upward march has been quite consistent. So if you tolerate a bit of risk, keep your head when the market gets choppy, and stick to a buy-and-hold investing strategy, then your portfolio should do just fine.
Of course, you should always make sure you set aside enough money to make your minimum loan payments. Missing payments can trigger late fees and do serious damage to your credit score. Beyond that, you're probably better off putting leftover funds into retirement savings. prioritizing saving for retirement is more profitable than paying off student loans faster.
All that said, each individual's situation is unique and influenced by factors such as the number of years until expected retirement, estimated future cash flow needs, and tax implications, among others. One way to figure out the best course for you is to map out how different options would work for you using tools such as Bankrate's loan calculator and savings calculator, which allow you to input your own details and see what various scenarios could mean for your future.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/13/these-5-oil-companies-fell-10-or-more-in-april-tim.aspx,2017-05-13,"
What happened
In April, five smaller oil and gas exploration and production companies fell 10% or more: Laredo Petroleum (NYSE:LPI), WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX), California Resources Corporation (NYSE:CRC), Callon Petroleum (NYSE:CPE), and W&T Offshore (NYSE:WTI). 
While it's certainly not unusual for smaller companies to suffer sharp monthly drops -- particularly energy companies in the current weak environment -- it's a good idea to look at the companies in question to see if the causes for the drops represent a change in the investment thesis.

Laredo, Callon, and WPX are all onshore Permian Basin oil and gas drillers, as opposed to California-based California Resources and Gulf of Mexico-based W&T Offshore. Image source: Getty Images.

So what
The performances of these five companies in April were much worse than the S&P 500 (yellow line in the chart below), the oil and gas industry at large (red line), and larger drillers like ConocoPhillips:

COP data by YCharts.
W&T Offshore, down 26.4% for the month, had by far the worst performance, on no news other than the retirement of one of the company's vice presidents. W&T, whose operations are focused in the Gulf of Mexico, has far underperformed the vast majority of its industry peers since 2014. So although this particular drop seems unwarranted, there's no clear indication that a significant rise in price is imminent. 
California Resources Corporation was spun off from Occidental Petroleum in 2014, and operates exclusively in the state of California -- not known as a hub of petroleum activity. The company's narrow geographic focus unfortunately limits its ability to follow in the footsteps of other oil and gas exploration and production companies like Conoco and actively manage its assets, selling those that generate lower returns and buying into higher-margin opportunities in Texas and New Mexico. The stock's 22.2% loss in April was on no major news, but it has lost 83.5% of its value since its spinoff, and in the current environment, a turnaround seems unlikely.
Callon, WPX, and Laredo's drops of 10%, 10.9%, and 11.9%, respectively, largely mirrored the overall industry's April declines, but were slightly steeper, probably due to their small size. The largest market cap of the bunch is WPX's, at about $4.8 billion. Compare that to Conoco at about $58.9 billion. All three are onshore producers with traditional shale drilling operations in the massive Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. WPX also has operations in the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and the San Juan Basin in Colorado/New Mexico. Like the other two companies, there was no particular news item responsible for their stocks' drops.

Now what
Currently, industry conditions favor larger companies that can use their resources to make portfolio and operational adjustments to maximize profitability and manage debt. All five of these companies have significant debt loads and little cash on hand. And none of them pay dividends to reward shareholders through the current tough times. 
If you're looking to invest in an oil and gas exploration and production company, there are plenty of companies that are better-positioned to weather the current industry downturn, and that pay a dividend to reward you in the meantime. You might want to consider Apache, which may be one of the best bargains in the oil patch today.

The fact that these two companies were once joined at the hip makes this challenge all the more interesting. Investors who are familiar with auction site eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) will no doubt also know about its erstwhile segment, payment service PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). The companies shared a common history after joining forces in 2002, but parted ways in July 2015. Those who were invested in eBay at the time of the split would have received shares in PayPal and may still hold shares in each.
Both companies are longtime players that fill a niche serving digital consumers in the growing trend of e-commerce. How are investors to know which is the better buy right now? While past performance is no indicator of future success, a review of the recent results and a little analysis may help determine the best place to put your hard-earned dollars if you were to establish a position today.

The case for eBay
eBay still runs its legacy consumer auction platform where it puts buyers and sellers together and gets a piece of each transaction. The company can grow in a couple of ways -- it can entice more buyers and sellers to its platform or encourage existing users to increase the number of transactions. Toward that end, it has been working to enhance its mobile offering and create a more personalized experience for its users. eBay sees its future as a niche player, joining buyers and sellers.
In its most recent quarter, eBay grew revenue to $2.2 billion up 4% over the prior year quarter. The company's active buyers also increased 4% to 169 million year over year, while gross merchandise volume grew 2% over the prior-year quarter. Its online ticket exchange platform StubHub is its fastest-growing segment, which saw revenue jump 18% to $210 million year over year.
Over the trailing-12-month period, eBay produced revenue of just over $9 billion and earnings per share of $6.96, but its earnings included numerous one-time items not related to ordinary operating activities, which skew the figure and therefore should not be included in any comparison.
Without these one-time items, the company would have produced revenue of $9 billion and normalized earnings per share of $1.25 over the trailing 12 months. For 2017, the company expects its revenue to grow between 6% and 8% to $9.3 billion and $9.5 billion and produce earnings per share of between $1.20 and $1.40.

The case for PayPal
PayPal continues to leverage its position as the most well-known digital payment platform and build upon that by transforming itself to more of a mobile wallet. The company has embarked on a host of partnerships that include all of the major credit card issuers to give consumers the option to choose a funding source for each transaction and is also streamlining the signup process for new account holders. PayPal is driving engagement with its One Touch feature, which allows consumers to skip the login and use PayPal directly on merchant sites.
In the most recent quarter, PayPal produced revenue of $2.98 billion, up 17% over the prior-year quarter. Active customer accounts increased to 203 million, up 11% year over year while the number of payment transactions increased 23% to 1.7 billion, and payments per active customer climbed 12%.
Over the trailing 12 months, PayPal produced revenue of $11.27 billion and earnings per share of $1.18, and expects to increase revenue by 15% to 17% for 2017 and produce earnings of between $1.28 and $1.33 per share.

Recent performance
As you can see from the chart below, since the two companies separated in July 2015, both have beaten the broader S&P 500, though PayPal has returned 28% compared to eBay's 21%. Given the better stock performance, PayPal also enjoys a higher valuation, at 42 times a trailing earnings compared to a minuscule five times for eBay, according to Yahoo! Finance. It is important to note, however, that eBay's valuation is skewed by one-time items. Factoring these out, its valuation becomes a more reasonable 27 times trailing earnings. Going forward, eBay expects its earnings for the year to be essentially flat.

Verdict
PayPal has been expanding beyond its humble beginnings, while eBay remains tethered to the past. Taking into account both companies' own growth forecast and recent results is illuminating. While I hold positions in both companies, I believe the migration toward digital payments provides PayPal greater opportunities than does eBay's legacy auction business.

Investors have well over 5,000 publicly traded stocks on reputable U.S. exchanges to choose from. Unfortunately, finding the proverbial needle in the haystack can often prove difficult.
But if you're looking for the world's most perfect stock, your search might end with national banking giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Shareholders who've held throughout both the dot-com bubble and the Great Recession would have netted a nearly 790% return since the beginning of December 1983. Best of all, JPMorgan Chase's stock may not be anywhere near done.
Here are 10 reasons JPMorgan Chase might just be the world's most perfect stock.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. Monetary tightening is great news 
Arguably the greatest reason to be in big bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase for the time being is the current monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve. After eight years of record-low rates, the Fed has raised its federal funds target by 25 basis points on three occasions since December 2015 as the U.S. economy has improved. Fed funds target increases have the effect of increasing the yields on interest-bearing assets, including variable loans, putting more money in JPMorgan's pocket without a need for the bank to do a thing.
According to the bank's first-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates, as of the end of March 2017, would generate $2.3 billion in added net interest revenue for the company. A 200-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates, which is more or less in line with the Fed's long-term goal of a 3% fed funds rate, would add an estimated $3.8 billion in net interest revenue. While this isn't pure profit, the margin being generated from these interest rate hikes is very juicy for JPMorgan.
2. Its bread-and-butter businesses are on the upswing 
Sometimes boring really is better when it comes to banks. Deposit and loan growth is what you might call the bread-and-butter foundation for all banks. As of the first quarter, JPMorgan Chase was generating pretty steady growth in both respects.
In the company's consumer and community banking operations, average deposits increased 11% to $622.9 billion year over year, while average loans rose 5% from the prior-year quarter. Similar strong improvements were seen in its asset- and wealth-management operations, where record average loan balances rose 7% year over year to $118.3 billion and average deposit balances increased 5% to $158.8 billion over the same time frame. If slow but steady wins the race, JPMorgan is likely at or near the front of the pack.

            });
        

3. Diversified organic growth from multiple operating segments 
Another factor that investors in JPMorgan Chase are bound to appreciate is the bank's focus on organic growth. This isn't to say that the company doesn't have the funds to purchase its way into new markets via acquisitions, but that's not how this bank grows historically.
Look across its gamut of operating segments and you'll see pretty steady growth throughout. And in areas where income declined, other segments tend to step up and compensate for a single division's weakness. For instance, in Q1 we witnessed a decline in net income from its flagship consumer and community banking segment, likely a result of higher expenses and credit costs. However, corporate and investment banking income more than doubled to $3.2 billion, while commercial banking net income hit a record of $799 million, up 61% year over year.
Long story short, this is a well-balanced organic growth machine.
4. Cost-cutting provides an avenue to improve margin
Though a stronger U.S. economy has helped JPMorgan deliver solid organic growth as a whole, its management team isn't oblivious to the fact that prudent cost-cutting can also help improve margins.
JPMorgan Chase has actively been looking at ways to reduce its physical imprint (i.e., close branches) to save money. As of the end of Q1 2017, the bank had 5,246 branches, down 139 from the year-ago period, or about 3%. This is a continuation of a plan announced in 2015 to close about 300 branches, or 5% of its physical banks, by the end of 2016. Doing so was expected to reduce expenses by $2 billion, which is on top of the $3.2 billion JPMorgan had already cut from expenses between 2012 and 2014. In short, more cost-cutting should yield even better financial flexibility.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-91148');
            });
        

5. A strong mobile push
Another reason JPMorgan Chase has been actively reducing its physical presence is the rising popularity of mobile banking among the younger generation. Data released from the company back in 2015 showed that depositing money with a teller costs more than 20 times as much as depositing money via a mobile app -- $0.65 versus $0.03. Focusing on mobile gives JPMorgan a way to improve consumer convenience, boost engagement with the next generation of workers, and cut its long-term costs.
As of the end of the first quarter, the company had 27.26 million active mobile customers, which was up by more than 3.4 million, or 14%, on a year-over-year basis. As this figure rises, the bank's ability to market these consumers increases while costs decline.
6. It's well capitalized 
Considering the capital crunch many financial institutions faced during the Great Recession, investors often keep a very close eye on how well funded today's banks are. When it comes to JPMorgan, there are few worries.
Once again referencing its Q1 report, the company ended the quarter with a Basel III leverage ratio of 12.4% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.1%. Both figures are up by 70 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Having been more prudent with its capital since the recession, and cleaning up its loan portfolio over the past decade, has had a big impact on strengthening its financial flexibility and ensuring it has the capital to survive a pretty steep recession, should one occur.

            });
        

7. Relatively positive consumer loan trends 
As is often the case with rising interest rates, JPMorgan has witnessed a modest uptick in its 30-plus-day credit card delinquencies and net charge-offs over the past two quarters. This is to be expected as indebtedness consumers struggle to adjust to higher variable credit card rates.
However, most aspects of JPMorgan's loan portfolio look great. Both home equity and residential short- and long-term delinquencies have been on a pretty steady decline over the past four years, while auto delinquencies and credit delinquencies are mostly stable since March 2013. Having a high-quality loan portfolio is important, because it means the bank doesn't have to set aside nearly as much in loan loss reserves.
8. Great Recession fines and settlements mostly in the rearview mirror 
One of the bigger hindrances for banks since the Great Recession have been a flurry of fines and settlements derived from their mortgage and lending practices. Though JPMorgan avoided having to pay north of $60 billion in aggregate fines like its peer Bank of America, it still wound up handing over a pretty penny to regulators, including around $20 billion worth of fines and penalties in 2013 alone.
Here's the good news: JPMorgan's hefty fines are mostly in the rearview mirror. In January, the company agreed to pay $55 million to settle an investigation into whether it was charging certain borrowers higher interest rates than others, but $55 million is a far cry from the days where billion-dollar fines were seemingly the norm. What this means is investors are getting a cleaner look at the company's results, which is allowing for a more accurate valuation of the company.

9. Shareholder yield 
Despite looking to cut costs, JPMorgan Chase hasn't forgotten about its shareholders. The bank has done a good job rewarding investors through share buybacks and via dividend growth.
For instance, in June of last year the company announced a $10.6 billion stock repurchase program that'll run through the end of June this year. Remember, buying back stock reduces the total number of shares outstanding, which in turn can lift earnings per share and lower a company's P/E ratio, making it look more attractive to Wall Street and investors.
JPMorgan Chase has also lifted its quarterly dividend by a cumulative 32% ($0.38 to $0.50) over the past four years. This works out to a current yield of 2.3%, which is slightly above the average yield of the S&P 500.
10. An attractive valuation 
And of course, JPMorgan is also attractive on a valuation basis.
The bank ended Q1 with a tangible book value (TBV) of $52.04, up nicely from the $48.96 in TBV reported in Q1 2016. Based on its recent closing price, it's valued at a little less than 1.7 times TBV. Typically, Wall Street doesn't worry about bank valuations (especially the valuations of superior performers) until they cross two times TBV. This leaves JPMorgan Chase's stock ample room to run higher and grow its TBV.
On a more nominal basis, it's valued at just 11 times next year's EPS and could see in the neighborhood of 10% EPS growth each year during the current monetary tightening cycle.
It's quite possible that JPMorgan Chase may be the world's most perfect stock.

As for individual stocks, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) and Hertz (NYSE:HTZ) made big moves following their quarterly earnings reports.

Marriott raises its outlook
Investors pushed Marriott shares 6.3% higher after the hotel chain announced robust first-quarter growth. Revenue per available room (RevPAR) rose 3.1% on surprisingly strong travel demand in the U.S. and in the company's Asia-Pacific region. In contrast, management three months ago forecast RevPAR growth of 2% at the midpoint of guidance.
The boost helped power sales of $5.56 billion, which beat consensus estimates that were targeting $5.29 billion. At the same time, rising food and beverage sales helped push hotel-level margins up by a full percentage point, allowing net income to jump 67% to $365 million.

""We were pleased by our performance in the quarter across the board,"" CEO Arne Sorenson said in a press release. ""RevPAR exceeded our expectations in North America and Europe due to stronger group attendance and higher-rated business transient demand,"" he added.
Looking ahead, the company plans to focus on integrating the massive Starwood business it recently acquired into the operations. Meanwhile, growth trends are improving, and so Sorenson and his team raised their 2017 RevPAR forecast to between 1% and 3% from the prior target of 0.5% to 2.5%. Investors can also expect the company to keep aggressively building on its portfolio of rooms, as Marriott is targeting an additional 6% of gross room additions in 2017.

Hertz' expensive turnaround plan
Hertz shares slumped 14% after the car rental company posted quarterly results that showed deteriorating operating trends. Vehicle utilization dropped to 75% in the key U.S. market, down 3 percentage points from the prior year. Daily revenue also slipped lower, as did revenue per unit on its fleet of cars. These trends combined to push Hertz's pre-tax loss to $116 million in the U.S. from a loss of $4 million a year ago.
Lower residual values on used cars pinched results, too, especially given that the company is currently selling a significant portion of its fleet to make room for newer models. Depreciation expenses shot up to 37% of sales from 31%.
CEO Kathryn Marinello said that the management team was ""mindful of today's headwinds related to used car residual values,"" but that ""our commitment to investing in the business remains steadfast."" Thus, Hertz plans to continue pouring resources into initiatives like improving fleet quality and boosting the customer experience. ""These investments are critical to rebuilding our position as a leader in the global rental car market,"" Marinello added.
Still, the latest performance figures aren't yet improving as a result of the team's turnaround plan, and so investors pushed shares lower in response to the widening operating loss.

From soda companies to hedge fund managers, of the best indicators of a business's quality is its ability to control the price at which it sells its goods or services. As low-cost funds continue to collect hundreds of billions of dollars in assets with each passing year, fund managers that are charging above-average fees for below-average performance are at risk of having to cut prices or lose assets to lower-cost alternatives.


In this segment from Industry Focus: Financials, join The Motley Fool's Gaby Lapera and Jordan Wathen as they discuss the importance of pricing power in fund management fees for investors who own shares of asset management companies.

A full transcript follows the video.







This video was recorded on April 24, 2017.

Gaby Lapera: We talked a little bit about what alternative asset managers are, how they make money, different revenue streams, things that should look good on their income sheet, income statement, balance sheet, 10-K, 10-Q, financial statements in general. Is there anything you would look at and be like, ""This is a huge red flag for an asset manager""?
Jordan Wathen: I think this extends across any business, financial or otherwise: Truly great businesses have pricing power. That means they can raise prices, or at least control prices, to some extent. For example, if Warren Buffett tomorrow stepped down from Berkshire Hathaway and said, ""I'm going to raise a $5 billion stock fund and become a hedge fund manager again,"" he would have no problem finding investors at 2% and 20%, the typical fee structure. I bet he would even have a line out the door at 3% and 30%. There's actually a company by the name of Renaissance Technologies, it runs something called The Medallion Fund. It's the most legendary hedge fund of all time: It charges 5% on assets, plus 44% of returns. The fees are ridiculous, but the returns are so good, no one cares. If you earn 20% after fees, you don't care what the fees are, it just doesn't matter. So, while investment fees are generally coming down, good asset managers should be able to hold the line, or at least slow the ...
Lapera: The free fall?
Wathen: ... the trend toward lower fees.
Lapera: Yeah. And part of the reason for that trend toward lower fees is actually in an alternative asset management adjacent field, which is the ETFs and the mutual funds and the index funds. You're seeing fees go down really fast in those areas because of the automatically generated nature of these. Companies like Vanguard are pushing for lower fees, because it doesn't make sense in a lot of cases for an S&P 500 ETF, for example, to have a 1% management fee. That doesn't make sense. You're just taking all the companies that are in the S&P 500 -- you're not guessing or anything -- and putting them into an index fund. So, I think you're seeing this widespread fee lowering. The other thing is the power of information. Now that consumers have the internet, they can just go and see what the fees are on other funds, and be like, ""You know, I'm not going to pay 1% when I could pay 0.5% for this other fund.""
Wathen: It's the exact same thing that's going on in traditional asset managers. If a mutual fund manager could promise me they were going to beat the S&P 500 by 2% a year, I'd happily pay 1.75% a year in expenses and take the 0.25% extra return. No one is going to complain about that. But if the returns aren't there and you're charging a higher fee, you won't be in business very long. And ETFs, and all these passive funds, for that matter, are really just taking more and more share for that reason.
Lapera: Yeah, which is why I, as we circle back to alternative asset managers, they are able to charge higher fees -- because in theory, they're making more than the return on the S&P 500.
Wathen: Right, they're generating superior returns, and they're also working harder for it. Oaktree, when it takes a distressed debt fund and starts raising money for it and then starts investing in it, they're going to have to go through bankruptcy courts, all this stuff, to take control of these companies. It's a long slog. It takes money and capital and geniuses to figure out these opportunities. So, that's what you're paying for, in theory.

",Asset Management Stocks: Pricing Power is Everything
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/12/why-astrazeneca-globalstar-and-snap-jumped-today.aspx,2017-05-12,"
Friday was a mixed day on Wall Street, with major benchmarks heading in different directions as investors again struggled to figure out what's likely to move the market going forward. A number of downbeat earnings reports from the retail sector again weighed on the general mood, and some investors seemed ready for a pause in the run that has taken the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to all-time highs recently. Even with a mixed market, though, some stocks did particularly well, and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT), and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) were among the best performers on the day. Read on to find out why.
AstraZeneca has good news on cancer treatment
Shares of AstraZeneca rose 9% after the pharmaceutical company said that one of its candidate drugs had extremely encouraging results in a phase 3 trial. AstraZeneca's Imfinzi treatment met a primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with locally advanced, unresectable stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer, and the company said that its drug was the first immuno-oncology medicine to show superior results. As a result, AstraZeneca is talking with regulators over plans to submit Imfinzi for approval for this indication, and in light of the fact that the company recently got accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Imfinzi for treating advanced bladder cancer, investors are more excited than ever about the potential for expanded uses of the drug.

Globalstar climbs skyward as shareholders eye possible sale
Globalstar stock soared nearly 20% in the wake of reports that the satellite company might be seeking a bidder interested in acquiring it. Consolidation among communications companies has been fast and furious recently, and rumors of a possible sale of Globalstar have been circulating for a while. Given Globalstar's financial challenges, some see an acquisition as the best possible exit strategy for the company. With considerable competition in the broader telecom space and in satellite communications in particular, Globalstar will have to work hard to sustain its place in the industry if it can't find a potential partner to work with it going forward.

Snap bounces back
Finally, shares of Snap gained 6%. The move came after a much more precipitous 21% drop on Thursday following the social media company's first earnings report as a publicly traded company. Snap's revenue almost quadrupled from year-ago levels, but the company posted a huge loss of $2.2 billion, and both figures fell short of the expectations that investors had for Snap. In particular, its daily active user count of 166 million was especially discouraging. Yet on Friday, investors seemed to conclude that they had overreacted to the bad news, and some decided that the lower share price was a good opportunity to buy the stock on the cheap. Nevertheless, Snap still trades near its lowest levels in its short history as a public company, and it will need to step up its game going forward to avoid bigger disappointments.

The stock market started the week on a high note, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 85 points, or 0.41%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each delivered similar gains to close at all-time highs today, driven partly by a spike in the price of crude oil following an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia to ""do whatever it takes to achieve the desired goal of stabilizing the market,"" the latter country's energy ministry stated.
But a few individual stocks soared even higher than the overall market today, including FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), Patheon (NYSE:PTHN), and Vista Outdoor (NYSE:VSTO). Read on to learn what drove these unusual jumps.

FireEye catches one analyst's eye
Shares of cybersecurity specialist FireEye climbed 7.5% today after encouraging comments on the company and its industry from Goldman Sachs analyst Gabriela Borges.
On the heels of the recent cyberattack from ransomware virus WannaCry, which infected an estimated 300,000 computers worldwide over the past few days, Borges predicted FireEye's incident response business would enjoy a relative ""uptick in demand given its best-in-class reputation."" 
""Ransomware has been gaining traction as an attack method over the last several years because of its low cost to implement,"" Borges elaborated, ""but this attack is unique in its breadth.""
Shares of FireEye most recently jumped more than 13% in a single day earlier this month after the company announced stronger-than-expected first-quarter results, including solid customer additions and a narrower net loss as it makes progress toward its goal of sustained profitability. As prominent cyberattacks like WannaCry spur the need for FireEye's products and services, I suspect it should have little trouble reaching that goal in time.
Patheon pairs off
Patheon stock skyrocketed 33.1% today after the drug development and delivery solutions company announced it has agreed to be acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) for $35 per share in cash. That represents a 34.6% premium to Patheon's closing price on Friday, and values the company at $7.2 billion, including Thermo Fisher's assumption of roughly $2.0 billion of net debt. 
""Over the past several years, we have increased our capabilities to become a leading CDMO provider in a highly fragmented market,"" stated Patheon CEO James Mullen. ""We are confident that our combined offerings and Thermo Fisher's proven track record of disciplined M&A and successful integrations will take our business to the next level.""
The deal is expected to close by the end of this year, but is still subject to regulatory approvals and the adoption of ""certain resolutions relating to the transaction"" by Patheon shareholders. With shares trading just 1% below the agreed acquisition price -- and unless waiting to sell would result in more favorable capital gains tax treatment -- I think Patheon investors would do well to take their profits and put them to work elsewhere.

Vista Outdoor's C-suite shakeup
Finally, shares of Vista Outdoor rose 5.2% on Monday after the outdoor sports and recreation products company appointed Kenny Bement as vice president and corporate controller, effective today. On June 5, 2017, Bement will also assume the role of chief accounting officer from Tom Sexton, who announced his impending retirement earlier this year. Bement, for his part, most recently served as controller of reporting and governance for Google parent Alphabet. Before that, he oversaw SEC reporting, corporate accounting, and accounting policies at Raytheon, and worked for almost five years on the staff of the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board.
If you're wondering why the market is excited about this particular executive addition, recall shares of Vista Outdoor plunged nearly 30% in February after retail weakness and headwinds in its hunting and shooting accessories segment triggered an evaluation of goodwill. In turn, that evaluation resulted in a massive $449 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. 
Vista Outdoor investors are right to celebrate bringing an experienced accounting executive like Bement on board with the hope of avoiding such situations in the future.

Following their worst single-day drop so far in 2017 yesterday, U.S. stocks enjoyed a modest rebound on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing around 56 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fared better, increasing 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively. Helped by the news that unemployment claims fell 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000 for the week ended May 13, investors were cautiously weighing the Justice Department's appointment of former F.B.I. director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the investigation of ties between President Trump's campaign and Russia.
Whether political turmoil will have extended negative effects on the economy remains unclear. But in the meantime, several individual stocks bucked the market's overall positive trend today, including clothing retailer Ascena Retail Group (NASDAQ:ASNA), McDonald's franchisee Arcos Dorados (NYSE:ARCO), and building materials specialist James Hardie Industries (NYSE:JHX). Read on to learn what drove these unusual declines.

Ascena Retail's disappointing new normal
Shares of Ascena Retail Group plummeted 27% today after the parent company of brands including Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant, Maurices, and dressbarn significantly reduced its financial guidance.
More specifically, Ascena expects third-quarter comparable sales to be down 8% year over year, which should translate to adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.04 to $0.06 -- a reduction from previous EPS guidance of $0.07 to $0.12. For the full-year 2017, Ascena sees comparable sales declining in the range of 7% to 6%, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.10 to $0.15 -- down from $0.37 to $0.42 previously.
Ascena Retail CEO David Jaffe elaborated: ""Industrywide traffic headwinds and a highly elevated promotional environment have persisted at levels significantly above our expectations, resulting in a miss to our third quarter sales and earnings outlook. We have adjusted our second-half outlook to reflect this environment and limited near term visibility, and no longer believe it appropriate to expect a stabilization of traffic and resulting normalization of comp sales against softer demand in the year-ago period.""
To be fair, Ascena also accelerated its ""Change for Growth"" transformation program, which includes fleet optimization initiatives and the rollout of new technology platforms to maximize sales and boost margins. Together with a newly expanded cost reduction plan, Ascena expects to achieve $250 million to $300 million in cost savings, up from its prior $150 million goal.
But Ascena also said it expects the sector to ""remain challenging for the next 12 to 24 months."" And this announcement effectively confirmed concerns that surfaced last week following multiple disappointing earnings reports from Ascena's peers. Combined with the gravity of its guidance reduction, it's no surprise to see investors taking a big step back from Ascena Retail stock today.
Arcos Dorados feels the heat of Brazil
Arcos Dorados stock fell 10% today despite no company-specific news regarding the Latin American McDonald's franchise giant. Rather, the decline came amid concerns over the fallout of a corruption scandal involving Brazil's president, Michel Temer. 
For perspective, Brazil's Bovespa stock market index plunged 10% early today, then was briefly halted after reports that Temer was taped agreeing to pay a potential witness to remain silent in the country's largest-ever graft probe. Multiple Brazilian MPs have filed requests to begin impeachment proceedings, leaving the future of Temer's pro-business economic reform plans in doubt.
Meanwhile, recall shares of Arcos Dorados only recently popped more than 8% in a single day earlier this month after the company announced strong first-quarter results. Within those results, Arcos Dorados listed profitability improvements in Brazil -- where it had 904 restaurants at the end of last quarter -- as ""the key contributor"" to its 30% growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). It's clear that if economic turmoil extends to Brazil's fast-food market, Arcos Dorados will feel the pressure.

James Hardie crumbles after a strong quarter
Finally, shares of James Hardie Industries declined 6.2% today after the fiber cement building products specialist announced fourth-quarter 2017 results.
That's not to say James Hardie's results were bad. Revenue climbed 13% year over year this quarter, to $494.3 million, including a 12% increase in North America fiber cement segment sales to $387.7 million. That brought full-year revenue to roughly $1.92 billion -- slightly ahead of analysts' expectations for $1.90 billion. On the bottom line, full-year net income increased 13.1% year over year to $276.5 million, or $0.62 per share, also ahead of investors' expectations for earnings of $0.57 per share.
Keeping in mind James Hardie previously reduced its guidance for adjusted net income in February, CEO Lou Gries admitted that supply disruptions throughout the year have resulted in lost market share and ongoing supply constraints in the United States. 
Gries added:

During the year we significantly increased our manufacturing capacity with the addition of four new brownfield lines that will drive a high, longer term, return on capital for the company. However, this capacity growth created challenges for our North America manufacturing network as we accelerated commissioning of new capacity and overall performance of the network lagged fiscal year 2016 performance. [...] Improving the performance of our North America manufacturing network remains a key focus for the business going forward.

This was a solid performance, all things considered. And it's worth keeping in mind that James Hardie stock was already up nearly 20% in the full year leading up to this report. As we wait for the company to provide more tangible evidence of improvement in its core North American business, however, it's hard to blame some investors for taking profits off the table.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/15/3-things-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-this-week.aspx,2017-05-15,"
Stocks dipped last week as both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) fell by less than 1%. Yet the indexes remain firmly in positive territory for the year.

^DJI data by YCharts.
Earnings season keeps rolling on this week, and so investors can expect plenty of volatility ahead in individual stocks. A few of the most anticipated reports set to be released include those from Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Foot Locker (NYSE:FL).
Home Depot's customer traffic
Home Depot will post its results before the market opens on Tuesday, and consensus estimates call for the home-improvement giant's sales to rise 4%, to $23.7 billion. While that pace would trail rival Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) and its expected 11% gain, the more illustrative match-up is in comparable-store sales, where Home Depot has trounced Lowe's in recent years. Its comps improved by 5.6% last year, compared to Lowe's 4.2%.

The performance gap is expected to continue in 2017: Home Depot has projected a 4.6% comps improvement, while Lowe's sees 4.1% growth in the new fiscal year. The company's expanding presence in the professional customer segment will be key to its continued market share gains. Investors will also be looking for progress in an e-commerce initiative that has put Home Depot among a small class of traditional retailers who are thriving as customer traffic moves to online channels. Finally, look for the company to update its full-year forecast based on the latest economic trends in the housing market.
Wal-Mart's profits
A simple focus on value helped Wal-Mart become the biggest retailer on the planet and delivered huge gains to long-term investors in the process. Yet as consumers flock to online shopping, the retailing giant has given up a significant chunk of profits recently as it invests in its existing stores while building up its own e-commerce platform.

WMT Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts.
Investors are expecting another dip this week, with profits set to fall to $0.96 per share from $0.98 per share a year ago. Revenue should tick higher by less than 2% to $117.8 billion. The company is slated to report Thursday before the market opens.
Customer traffic trends will be key to watch, since they've only improved modestly over the last few quarters. Management credits initiatives like boosting in-stock levels and raising employee wages for the rebound. That's why continued traffic gains are essential to supporting the notion that Wal-Mart can defend its huge, expensive store footprint against rising threats from online-only rivals.

            });
        

Foot Locker's growth trends
Investors aren't excited about Foot Locker's results set to publish before the market opens on Friday. After all, the apparel retailer warned in late April that comps slumped in the first month of the quarter thanks mainly to a delay in tax refunds. Growth picked up once those checks started flowing later on, but the boost ""did not fully offset the slow start to the quarter,"" CEO Richard Johnson explained, as the company lowered its first-quarter outlook.

Johnson and his team still aim to boost comps in the mid-single-digits for the year to keep up the solid expansion pace they managed in 2016. In addition to any updated guidance, profitability will likely get plenty of attention in Friday's report. If the company had to slash prices to keep inventory moving, that might suggest the struggles that showed up toward the end of 2016 were part of a more fundamental industry shift that threatens its growth outlook. 
",3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/18/3-dividend-stocks-for-sharp-investors.aspx,2017-05-18,"
Sharp investors know that buying into dividend-paying stocks represents a smart way to get paid to wait for their investment thesis to pay off. Dividends plus capital gains can power a portfolio to big, long-term gains.
We asked three Motley Fool contributors to give us their recommendations for dividend-paying stocks that sharp, income-seeking investors might want to add to their portfolios. Read on to discover why they believe Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Acushnet Holdings (NYSE:GOLF) fit the bill.

Image source: Accenture.

A smarter way to play the tech boom
Brian Feroldi (Accenture): The tech landscape is constantly in flux, which makes it tough for investors to separate the winners from the losers. That's why I believe that a great way to profit from the next great technological change is to buy shares of Accenture.
Accenture is a consulting company that specializes in technology and outsourcing. The company makes its money by selling the talents of its 400,000+ workers to other businesses that need help keeping up with the latest tech trends. This is a highly lucrative business that has driven Accenture's revenue and profits higher for years. 
A quick glance at Accenture's recent results shows that its services are still very much in demand. New order bookings grew to $9.2 billion, which was well ahead of the company's quarterly revenue of $8.3 billion. That suggests that Accenture's top-line is poised for continued growth. Meanwhile, Accenture continues to use its growing profits stream to reward shareholders with a rising dividend and a declining share count. Accenture pays its dividend twice a year and yields roughly 2% at the current stock price. 

ACN Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts
Even though Accenture boasts a strong brand, durable business model, and has a long history of rewarding shareholders, Accenture's stock is trading at only 20 times trailing earnings. That represents a discount to the S&P 500 in general, which makes this a stock that offers investors growth, income, and value.

Image source: Target.

Targeting a juicy 4% yield
Dimitri Kalogeropoulos (Target): Focusing on stocks with above-average dividend yields is just plain smart. After all, you could get a nearly 2% payout just by purchasing a broadly diversified index fund. The good news is that it's possible to grab a much higher dividend without venturing into distressed businesses with little chance of raising or even maintaining their current payout.
Consider Target, whose sharp stock price decline over the past year has helped push its yield over 4%. Sure, this Dividend Aristocrat -- it has paid a dividend each quarter since going public in 1967 -- is going through tough times right now. Customer traffic fell by 1% last year to mark a discouraging slowdown from the prior year's 1% uptick . Yet Target still generated over $5 billion of operating cash -- easily enough to cover its $1.3 billion of dividend commitments. And its payout ratio remains comfortably below 50% of earnings .
The biggest risk I see with this retailer is that management's turnaround strategy relies too much on price cuts and thus harms the branding advantage that's produced significantly higher margins than those of value-based retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT). Target isn't well-equipped to win such a price war.
On the other hand, if executives find the right balance between competitive pricing and the exclusive, premium content in signature categories like baby care and apparel that Target is known for, then this retailer could be a great long-term buy for income investors seeking an unusually high, but well covered, payout.

            });
        

Teeing off on a dividend-paying IPO
Rich Duprey (Acushnet Holdings): Although Acushnet Holdings went public last October, this isn't simply some new-to-market outfit, but an industry player that's been around since the 1930s that owns one of the biggest names in the golf industry, Titleist.
Acushnet has gone through several owners over the years, and its IPO represented an opportunity for some of its owners at the time to cash out their stakes when the industry is in a state of flux. Retailer Golfsmith declared bankruptcy, for instance, and while Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS) bought up a bunch of its stores to put in its Golf Galaxy chain, it said it would be limiting the amount of space devoted to the sport.
At the same time, both Adidas and Nike announced they were exiting the hard goods business of golf while maintaining a presence in apparel. That could work to Acushnet's benefit.
Golf balls account for 36% of the equipment maker's revenues while golf clubs represent another 26%. It will obviously face competitive pressure in its own footwear and apparel division, Footjoy, which generated 28% of net sales.
The public offering wasn't viewed as an overwhelming success, likely because of the transition the industry is undergoing, and shares subsequently retreated back to their $17 IPO level. More recently they're trading above $19 a share while paying a dividend of $0.48 per share annually that currently yields 2.5%. Coupled with the fact its stock goes for 23 times earnings and 15 times next year's estimates, less than the market's multiple, and it trades at a fraction of its sales and 16 times the free cash flow it produces -- not bargain basement material, but a good value nonetheless -- Acushnet Holdings may be a company investors would like to play a few rounds with. 
",3 Dividend Stocks for Sharp Investors
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/10/why-wt-offshore-shares-dropped-264-in-april.aspx,2017-05-10,"
What happened
Shares of oil and gas driller W&T Offshore (NYSE:WTI) fell throughout April, finishing the month at $2.04 per share, down 26.4%. 
W&T is a small company primarily focused on natural gas liquids production in the Gulf of Mexico. In April, its market cap dropped about $100 million to $280 million. Huge swings like that aren't uncommon for small companies, but what was unusual was the apparent lack of rationale for the drop.

W&T Offshore has underperformed the industry over the last ten years. Image source: Getty Images.

So what
There's often some sort of catalyst for a drop like this: a broader market or sector decline, unfavorable industry news, or -- for an energy company -- falling oil or natural gas prices. As you can see from the blue line in the chart below, W&T stock's biggest drop came on April 18:

WTI data by YCharts
But as you can also see from the S&P 500's line on the chart above, there wasn't a broader market decline on that date. There was a bit of a drop in the overall oil and gas sector, but nothing that would account for the severity of W&T's slide. While other oil and gas producers -- particularly smaller ones -- dropped that day, none fell quite so far.
Nor where there any of the sort of company-specific causes one might expect to induce a big stock plunge: no underwhelming earnings report, no analyst downgrade, no unfavorable news coverage.
There was just one lone news item released by the company on April 18: Thomas F. Getten, the company's vice president, general counsel and secretary, who had been with W&T since 2006, retired and was succeeded by Shahid A. Ghauri. 
It seems inconceivable that such a minor news item could have caused such a pronounced stock slide; it's certainly possible that the timing was just a coincidence. But sometimes even minor news items can have a big impact on small, volatile companies that don't put out a lot of information. So even though it sounds weird, this may have been one of those cases where a piece of minor news had an outsized impact, or just turned a moderate drop into a severe one.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-16738');
            });
        

Now what
Obviously, you shouldn't buy or sell this stock -- or probably any stock -- based on whether the company's general counsel is retiring. But it goes to show that investors in small, volatile companies -- and W&T is both -- may have to stomach wild stock swings that happen with little or no reason.
As for W&T, the company has underperformed almost its entire industry since oil prices started sliding in 2014, losing more than 86% of its value. And given that it cut its dividend to zero in late 2015, there are better and safer places for your money in the oil patch.

Although the current earnings season is winding down, dividend raises continue to rain onto the market. Last week, the market was practically soaked as it saw nearly 30 lifts, by my count. 
And at least a few of those raises were from big, high-profile companies. Here are three of the more famous issuers bumping their payouts.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Apple
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been an aggressive dividend raiser since resuming its quarterly payout just over five years ago. The tech giant's latest hike is an 11% bump to $0.63 per share.
The company has been fairly generous with its raises. Since the relaunch, and adjusted for a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014, the distribution has risen considerably. Adjusted for that split, it has grown from around $0.38 per share to the present level.
Apple also announced an expansion of its share repurchase program, increasing the maximum authorized amount to $210 billion from the previous $175 billion.
The two moves reflect how the company has been doing as of late. Encouragingly, it's returned to revenue and profitability growth earlier this year, following three quarters of declines. In its recently reported second quarter, it managed to increase the former by almost 5% on a year-over-year basis to nearly $53 billion. Per-share net profit advanced by 11% to $2.10.  
Apple remains extremely profitable, with gross margins approaching 40%. Both cash from operations and free cash flow have seen growth recently, and the latter is more than sufficient to cover dividend payouts and share buybacks. I'd be very optimistic about the future of this dividend.

AAPL Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts.
Apple's new payout will be dispensed on May 18 to stockholders of record as of May 15. At the most recent closing stock price, it would yield 1.6%. That's a touch lower than the current 1.9% average of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500.
The company did not provide an end date for its current share repurchase initiative.
PepsiCo
PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), one of the top names in the food/beverage industry, is also one of its most aristocratic. That is to say, it's high on the list of Dividend Aristocrats, the group of stocks that have raised their dividends at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years in a row. 
In February, along with its Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, the company promised a 7% increase in its quarterly dividend to just under $0.81. Last week, the company made good on that promise by formally declaring the enhanced payout.

PEP Dividend data by YCharts.
The declaration comes after a first quarter that beat analyst expectations, although it wasn't exactly a quarter for the record books. Revenue inched up less than 2% on a year-over-year basis to land at just over $12 billion. And that increase was due to increased pricing, as opposed to organic growth (volumes were either flat or down in most regions).  
On a slightly more encouraging note, per-share adjusted net profit rose by almost 6% to clock in at $0.94.
Times are tough for businesses built on a core of sugary drinks (hello, Coca-Cola!) and traditional snacks, since consumers are continuing to opt for healthier alternatives. Pepsi is holding up fairly well considering, although if I were an investor, I'd prefer that the company break its recent habit of spending most, or even more, than its annual free cash flow on dividends and share buybacks.
PepsiCo's extra-fizz new distribution is to be paid on June 30 to investors of record as of June 2. It yields a theoretical 2.9%.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-80066');
            });
        

Marriott International
Storied hotel operator Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) is maintaining its one-raise-per-year habit. The company has declared a quarterly payout of $0.33 per share, a 10% increase over its predecessor.
That's to be expected, and not only because the company's a regular lifter. Its most recently reported quarterly results pleased the market, with Marriott convincingly beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines.
For the period, revenue rose by a beefy 47% to $5.56 billion, with adjusted net income also experiencing a pleasant boost (of 36%) to $395 million. The latter shook out to $1.01 per share, well exceeding the average $0.91 estimate from analysts. That top-line figure, meanwhile, was comfortably above projections of $5.29 billion. 
What went right? Well, Marriott is doing a good job of squeezing more from its visitors. Revenue per available room -- a key metric in the hotel industry -- saw a 3% rise during the quarter, even as the company added roughly 17,000 rooms to its total count.
Those improved fundamentals, plus recent strategic asset sales, are keeping cash flow nice and buoyant. Free cash flow has been rising steadily and encouragingly over the past few years, and at the latest annual tally of nearly $1.4 billion, it easily covered the approximately $942 million in dividend payouts and share repurchases. I think this trend will continue, and I expect the company will continue adding to the former.

MAR Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts.
Marriott's upcoming dividend will be handed out on June 30 to shareholders of record as of May 19. It would yield 1.3% on the current stock price.

As for individual stocks, Newell Brands (NYSE:NWL) and Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) attracted heavy investor interest following their quarterly earnings reports.

Newell Brands' rising profits
Shares of Newell Brands shot up 12% after the consumer products specialist posted surprisingly strong first-quarter results. Sales jumped 148% to $3.3 billion, edging consensus estimates that were targeting $3.2 billion of revenue. Newell also beat profit forecasts, as adjusted earnings came in at $0.34 per share compared to the $0.29 per share that Wall Street expected.
The sales spike came almost entirely from the company's purchase of the Jarden business that added brands like Rawlings and Mr. Coffee to a portfolio that already includes hit franchises such as Rubbermaid, Sharpie, and Coleman. Yet Newell's organic growth pace was a healthy 2.5%, as well -- right on pace with management's forecast.

Profitability fell thanks to the addition of the lower-margin Jarden business, but the drop wasn't as bad as Newell expected. ""Our operating margin was well ahead of plan driven by strong cost synergies and stringent discretionary cost management,"" CEO Michael Polk said in a press release.
Executives are still targeting organic sales growth of between 2.5% and 4% for the full fiscal year, but now see profit rising at a faster clip. Normalized earnings should be between $3.00 and $3.20 per share, up from prior guidance of $2.95 to $3.15 per share.

Tyson Foods' operating stumbles
Shares of Tyson Foods dropped 6% following the release of the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings report. The meat giant announced a small uptick in revenue despite a drop in volume across its beef, pork, chicken, and prepared foods segments. Even with the volume slip, though, higher prices led to increased profitability, especially in the pork business, where first-half operating margin has spiked to 15.2% of sales from 12.4% last year. ""Our beef and pork segments generated tremendous operating income in the second quarter,"" CEO Tom Hayes said in a press release, ""allowing us to invest in the long-term growth of our value-added businesses.""

Image source: Getty Images.

Results were hurt by a few operational issues during the quarter, including fires in two chicken plants that helped push operating margin down to 8.3% in the segment from 12.7% a year ago. Tyson's prepared foods segment also saw its profits dive to $87 million from $197 million due to what management described as ""on-going challenges"" in the pizza toppings and ingredients niche.
Tyson believes these issues are temporary and won't get in the way of it posting adjusted earnings of $4.90 to $5.05 per share, which would represent 12% growth at the midpoint of guidance. As for revenue, executives say they'll see flat sales in 2017 as broad volume gains are offset by lower beef prices.

3D printing company Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) is slated to report its first-quarter 2017 earnings before the market opens on Tuesday, May 16. 
Stratasys' stock, which took a beating from 2014 through last year, is having a great 2017. It's gained 81.1% through May 12, crushing the S&P 500's 7.6% total return and outpacing prime rival 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) powerful 64% gain.

Data sources: Stratasys and Yahoo! Finance.
Last quarter, Stratasys crushed earnings expectations and comfortably beat the revenue consensus, though the market sent shares tumbling more than 9% because the company's full-year 2017 guidance came in lighter than analysts were expecting. While long-term investors shouldn't place too much weight on Wall Street's near-term estimates, they can be useful to know since they often help make sense out of market reactions.
For additional context, 3D Systems reported on May 3 that its Q1 revenue increased 2.5%, with roughly 1% of that coming from an acquisition, and its adjusted EPS increased 20% from the year-ago period. The latter result disappointed Wall Street, with the market sending shares down more than 3% the day after earnings were released. 
In addition to the headline numbers, here's what to focus on in Stratasys' report.
Enterprise 3D printer sales
Along with 3D Systems, Stratasys has been struggling to grow revenue since early 2015, mainly because of a widespread slowdown in demand for its enterprise 3D printers.
Ideally, we'd like to see a year-over-year increase in revenue generated from 3D printer sales. However, even a continued improvement in this category would be a positive sign. Stratasys' revenue from 3D printer sales declined 19%, 20%, and 4% year over year, respectively, in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2016. Last quarter's 4% decline suggests that the bottom for this category could be near. And, in fact, if we see year-over-year growth this quarter, the bottom may be behind the company. That said, one quarter doesn't make a trend, so it might behoove investors to want to see at least two consecutive quarters of year-over-year 3D printer revenue growth before feeling fairly confident that the worse is behind the company.
For some context, 3D Systems' revenue from 3D printer sales continued their year-over-year decline in the first quarter, falling 4%.

Progress on developing next-generation technologies
Investors can probably count on management giving an update on the conference call on the company's progress in developing its two fused deposition modeling-based techs for production applications: Infinite Build and Robotic Composite. The million-dollar question is: Approximately when can investors expect to see some revenue from these new technologies?
Infinite Building prints on a vertical plane, which allows for a nearly unlimited part size in the build direction, and Robotic Composite uses automation to produce parts made from composite materials. Stratasys has top-name partners on both initiatives: Ford and Boeing on the former and Siemens on both. 
Continue to de-emphasize MakerBot 
Stratasys' MakerBot unit, which sells desktop 3D printers primarily targeted at the educational and professional markets, has also been struggling. However, MakerBot is so much smaller than the enterprise business that it makes less of an impact on Stratasys' total revenue and profitability (excluding when the company took huge goodwill impairment charges for this unit), which is why investors shouldn't pay too much attention to MakerBot.
Moreover, the enterprise 3D printer business drives Stratasys' razor-and-blade-like business model. On average, these printers (the ""razors"") use significantly more printing material (the ""blades"") over their lives than do MakerBot's Replicator 3D printers.
In short, Stratasys' long-term success depends upon sales of its enterprise 3D printers, so that's where investors' primary focus should be on Tuesday.

","Stratasys Earnings on Tuesday: With Its Stock Up 81% in 2017, Stratasys Has a Lot to Prove"

There's a lot of talk right now about President Donald Trump's proposal to lower the top corporate income tax rate from 35% down to 15%.
This would be a boon to companies. It would make them more profitable and thereby encourage them to invest more aggressively in growth. It would also allow companies to return more capital to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, as the government would be getting a smaller piece of the pie.
Of course, some companies would benefit more from Trump's proposed tax cuts than others. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks at the top. It earned $61 billion in pre-tax net income last year, remitting $15.7 billion, or 26%, to the government in the form of income taxes.

Data source: Apple 2016 10-K and author's calculations. Chart by author.

Under Trump's proposed 15% rate, Apple would have saved somewhere in the neighborhood of $6.5 billion last year. That's enough to buy 812.5 million ""Make America Great Again"" hats at Wal-Mart, or 7,065 hats for every Apple employee.
But a hat-buying spree seems unlikely. Apple would probably just raise its dividend or repurchase more stock.

This video was recorded on May 17, 2017.
Kristine Harjes: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It is May 17, and I'm your Healthcare show host, Kristine Harjes. I'm on the phone with Todd Campbell, a Fool.com healthcare writer. Todd, welcome to the show, as usual!
Todd Campbell: Hi, Kristine! How are you today?
Harjes: I'm doing all right, I'm getting ready for a trip to Toronto tomorrow, so pretty wired that it's basically my Friday.
Campbell: Oh, excellent, I hope you have a great time. I've always wanted to go up there, I've yet to travel up there.
Harjes: Yeah, I haven't been either. Listeners, if you listen to this before I actually go, which is tomorrow the 18th, please shoot me a note at industryfocus@fool.com. I'll take all the recommendations that you guys have for restaurants, and I hear there's a good music scene, and anything else that comes to mind. I'll be in Toronto and also Niagara Falls. So, that should be fun. Before I go, we are talking on the show today about two companies that have been incredibly beaten up by traders over the past couple years, and are both arguably value stocks right now. We're going to be talking about both Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences. Todd, which one do you want to start with?
Campbell: Let's start with Valeant, because of the two, that's the one that's been beaten up most. If you've been an investor in Valeant, you're probably looking at this stock and going, ""Oh boy, what's he going to say next?"" The stock has gone from about $260 to around $13 per share. But, it dropped below $10 or something like that. It's been tough sledding for the stock, and there's a lot of reasons, we covered it before, Kristine, on the show. As a refresher, there was a lot of pushback regarding pricing decisions that they had made in the past that led to scrutiny that led to the closure of their specialty distributor, pushback as a result of that and declining sales volumes has caused income to drop, and as a result, there has been a lot of fear that they might have a hard time paying off their debt load. So, heading into the first-quarter earnings results, a lot people were watching to see what management would say, and see if they provide some indication that the corner is turning.
Harjes: By the reaction the market had, it seemed like people were pretty happy with their earnings, which they released on May 9. The stock is up 40% since they released those earnings. On the surface, the headline was pretty good. They had their first profit that they posted in six whole quarters, but there's kind of an asterisk there where they reported a GAAP net income of $628 million, but that was almost entirely due to this one-time tax benefit of $908 million, which was attributed to non-cash internal restructuring. So, they're fudging the numbers a little bit, not in a nefarious way, but there's a huge difference for this company between their GAAP numbers and non-GAAP numbers.
Campbell: Right. You almost have to be a CPA to be able to dig in here and figure out what's going on behind the scenes, to have to reconcile the GAAP versus non-GAAP and figure, quarter for quarter, what is going on with the company. You mentioned that they'd reported top-line GAAP profitability. As you've said, that was all due to this one-time benefit from this tax item, so don't count on that going forward, you have to X that out. Revenue, the top line, did fall again, it was down 11% to $2.11 billion. So, you still have deterioration in the top line, and we'll get into why in a minute. But, without a doubt, Kristine, if you were a shareholder going into earnings last week, right now you're smiling a lot bigger than you were last week, especially if you were one of the fortunate ones to have been able to pick this thing up at the low.
Harjes: Right, indeed. This is something where, I guess, if you timed it correctly, you could have made quite a profit. But I do imagine that the vast majority of shareholders are still sitting on a pretty big loss here.
Campbell: I think that's probably true. Unfortunately for those long-term investors who have ridden the stock down, when I dug into the numbers and started really going through the puts and the takes here on balance, I had to walk away a little bit unimpressed. Their crown jewel is Bausch + Lomb. That's their biggest segment, it does $1.1 billion roughly in quarterly sales. But that crown jewel gained no ground year over year. Sales were essentially flat on a reported basis. Sure, if you back out currency, operational growth was 4%. But currency is something that these international companies deal with quarter after quarter. The reality is, sales for Bausch + Lomb were flat. And if you dig a little bit deeper, U.S. volume for Bausch + Lomb declined, and was offset by some emerging markets, overseas growth. So, Bausch + Lomb, we'll call it a push for the quarter. Branded Rx, sales continued to drop there, fell 9% to $604 million. Then, because of generic competition and some pricing woes, their U.S. diversified business got absolutely clobbered. Sales fell 37% year-over-year to $355 million. Unfortunately, the threat of generics is not going away -- this is going to remain a headwind for this company over the coming year.
Harjes: Right, pricing is going to be a huge issue for them, because of all the bad publicity that they got way back in 2015 when this whole controversy started about their cardiovascular drugs that they boosted the prices on by hundreds and hundreds of percents. They kind of can't do that anymore, and that was a big part of how they were making money. So, now, when you look at their portfolio, a lot of drugs are either hit or about to be hit by patent expirations, and they don't really have the option anymore of raising prices to compensate for lower volume.
Campbell: Yeah. So, we have a situation where we have a company that's still seeing a lot of pressure on its top line. There was a little bit of evidence of some price stability in Branded Rx, to be fair. So, that's somewhat good news. But, on balance, you look at this, and it's like, this wasn't that great of a quarter. Why on earth is the stock up 40-50% since the report?
Harjes: Yeah, and I know you have an interesting theory about this.
Campbell: Yeah. It's really all tied to the size of the short position, in my view, and a $50 million bump-up in its guidance for the year in EBITDA.
Harjes: Right. Let me take the latter thing you just said and expand on that a little bit. People are very concerned that Valeant is going to default on its debt. It has a humongous debt load, and for a long time, it's been kind of unclear whether or not they would be able to meet this debt. So, when they say they are going to up their EBITDA guidance, that is a great thing for people that are concerned about the debt. So, when you trace that back to the first thing you said, which was the short position, that is where you start to get people potentially exiting their shorts.
Campbell: Yeah. Again, as a refresher, if you're going to short a stock, you're borrowing from your broker, you'll selling it with the hope of buying it back cheaper and then replacing the shares that you borrowed. So, as a stock rallies and people who have sold it short see that happening, you end up getting a domino effect where, ""Oh, it's rallying, I have to cover, now I have to cover, and I have to cover."" If you look at the short ratio, which is simply the percentage of shares that are sold short toward the shares that are out there that can trade, it was at a record high leading up to the earnings. A record high.
Harjes: Right, 15%.
Campbell: Yeah. So, it wouldn't take a lot to move the needle here. And it really didn't. The bump up in EBITDA guidance was $50 million. They went from basically guidance of 3.5%-3.65% to 3.6%-3.75%, a $50 million improvement. But, again, the big thing here is the debt. They have over $30 billion in debt. They've knocked about $3 billion off of that. That's good news, because what that does it is it, theoretically, improves their interest coverage ratio. And now we're getting really wonky.
Harjes: It's a wonky company.
Campbell: Yeah. When you have all these creditors, they want to know they're going to be paid back. And one of the ways they do that is calculate your interest coverage ratio, which is simply EBITDA divided by interest expense. So, you have debt, you're paying interest expense on it. Are you generating enough EBITDA to cover that interest expense? Typically speaking, if you get below 2:1, it starts to get you a little bit nervous.
Harjes: Right. At the end of Q1, they were at 1.83, which is below that 2 threshold, but it is above what their newly renegotiated level is, which is 1.5, which is what their lenders need to see.
Campbell: Wow. There are so many rabbit holes we could chase here. They had to renegotiate a lot of these covenants lower because they were going to run into a risk of default, because they weren't going to make the 2:1 ratio. So, you had various ratios that range from 3:1 and 2:1. They've knocked those ratios down to 1.5:1, so they're still OK. And by bumping up the EBITDA guidance, that led people to believe, if EBITDA improves, then it's less likely that creditors are going to end up knocking at the door demanding payment, because that interest coverage ratio falls below the threshold. It gets even more complex than that, though, Kristine, because you have to look at where that EBITDA improvement is coming from. And frankly, I'm not convinced that's it's coming from a material improvement in the business.
Harjes: Right, and that's really what it comes out here, to bring it back to a little bit of a higher level -- this is a company that needs to find a way to come up with money. They need to service their debt. They can do that by having a better top line. We've already dug into the different business segments, and it's questionable whether or not they'll be able to do that in any significant way. Or, their other option is, they can sell some of their assets. But everybody else out there that could be a potential buyer for these assets knows exactly the situation that Valeant is in, so they're not going to pay a premium for some of these assets. Then, you get hit with a double whammy, if you're Valeant, of, I'm trying to get a good price for some of my portfolio. In order to get a good price, you need to sell the best stuff, and that's exactly the stuff that's going to bolster your top line.
Campbell: Right. And Kristine, just to make things even worse for them, that has a negative impact on EBITDA. So, you have to make sure you're paying off enough debt to lower your interest expense, at the same time you're selling these things that are generating out earnings. And one of the concerns I have going forward here is, they're selling one of their prized assets, Dendreon, which makes a prostate cancer drug called Provenge, they're selling that later this year, and their EBITDA guidance, it says right in the report that it doesn't include that sale in its calculation.
Harjes: Right. So, take out the sales from Provenge, and all of the sudden you get EBITDA lower.
Campbell: Right. You say, they paid down $3 billion in debt, so their interest expense has to be falling. But, because they had to renegotiate all of these deals, they're ending up having to pay more in interest. So, you shaved $3 off your debt, but at the same time, your interest expense actually went up year over year. Now, eventually, hopefully, if you look at the maturities on the debt, they're pretty manageable until about 2020. But, you have a lot of issues here, and I think it's maybe a little bit premature for investors to look through that report, see shares running, and say, ""Oh, OK, the corner has turned and the stock is going to go back to $100.""
Harjes: And it would be easy to do so, too, because by almost every metric, this is a very cheap stock. It's really just gotten clobbered by the market. But after having this discussion, hopefully it's pretty clear to our listeners that it's kind of for good reason. This could be a turnaround story, but personally, I don't think I would sleep at night if I bought shares of this company.
Campbell: Yeah, it's almost like skydiving without a parachute and hoping someone throws you a parachute and that you'll be able to catch it and open it before you hit the ground.
Harjes: [laughs] Yes, that's accurate imagery. I was trying to come up with something like a treadmill, but I like yours better, let's go with that.
OK, we said we were going to talk about Gilead Sciences, and that was not a lie. It is now time to dive into Gilead.
Campbell: This one hits a little bit close to home for me, Kristine, and I think maybe it does for you too?
Harjes: As a shareholder? Yeah.
Campbell: Yeah. This is a stock that is a behemoth in biotech. And unfortunately, its shares have fallen from $120 to about $65 since the summer of 2015, making the comparison even worse when you look at the fact that the S&P 500 has rallied and has been flirting with new highs. This stock has gotten clobbered. And it's been a tough run for shareholders like me, and I have to -- can we do a little confessional here?
Harjes: Let's hear it.
Campbell: I confess, I made a grave error in the way I normally approach stocks. I usually buy stocks -- we talked about this last week -- based on a particular catalyst, and then when I'm evaluating whether or not to hold the stock, I see if anything's changed that catalyst. Now, normally, if the catalyst has failed to pan out or change, that's a signal to me that I should sell or exit the stock. My catalyst did, indeed, change for Gilead, and I did not sell the stock. My cost is somewhere in the $90s, I'm down 20%-25%.
Harjes: What was the catalyst that you were looking for?
Campbell: I really thought their leadership in developing hepatitis C drugs was going to allow them to continue to innovate and dominate the market, which they have. But I also felt they would be able to innovate shorter and shorter treatment duration, getting it down to as little as four weeks over time from the 12 weeks it is currently. And it does look like that's not in the cards. It's looks like they're slowing down their efforts to continue to move the needle in developing new products for hepatitis C. I also underestimated the negative drag and impact of price concessions they would be forced to make to stay ahead of competitors like AbbVie. And, I also had bought it originally because I had some good thoughts that they would do well with their push into cancer drugs, and unfortunately that was a bust. Yet I looked at it and said, this is still a very profitable company, and now they're paying a dividend, and they have a ton of cash on the balance sheet, so I guess I'll stick around. Obviously, so far, that's been the wrong choice.
Harjes: The thing is, you talked a lot about hepatitis C, and I think that is what most people focus on with this company. But, if you look at what has happened to the company over the course of its HCV life cycle, its first hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, was approved in December 2013. At the time of approval, Gilead's market cap was $114 billion. Today's market cap of $86 billion is 25% lower than that. For me, I look at this company and I just can't help but think that the market has overreacted to its hepatitis C woes. And you're totally right about cancer not quite panning out, but I don't think there is as high hope and drama and expectation tied into its oncology efforts, necessarily, as it was for HCV sales.
Campbell: Yeah. I agree with you, in some respects. But here's the problem: We have yet to find a floor on those hepatitis C sales. In Q1, revenue came in a $2.6 billion across their hepatitis C franchise. That was down from $4.3 billion the year before.
Harjes: Yeah, that's a 40% decline.
Campbell: Yeah, massive drag. As a result, Q1 total sales were $6.5 billion. That was down 16.5%. EPS fell from $3.03 last year to $2.23 this year, ouch.
Harjes: Yeah, and I totally agree that that does hurt. But, I think with this company, it's important to remember that they have other things going on. In particular, their HIV products were very good in the last quarter. And that was how this company really made its name. Its HIV and HBV product sales were up year over year in the first quarter 13% to $3.3 billion. That's a good thing. Sales fell for some of the older products, but it was made up for by the newer ones like Genvoya and Descovy and Odefsey.
Campbell: Right. They've enjoyed a lot of growth, and that's because they reformulated Viread. They made it safer, and now they've been rolling out combination therapies that replace Viread in those combinations with TAF, this new formulation. I imagine that we'll probably see a leveling off in sales growth there once all the combination therapies have been launched. But, yes, they remain a dynamo in that business. It's a great business for them, and it's been a growing business for them, it just hasn't been growing fast enough to offset the slide in sales in hepatitis C. So, you look at it from an investment standpoint now, and you say, OK, well, we know that HIV is going to be stable to growing. That's good. And we know that hepatitis C is declining, and we don't know where the floor is.
Harjes: And that's bad.
Campbell: Yeah, that's bad. So, we say, what's the catalyst, what's going to cause this stock to get back to growth? Because, ultimately, we want to see sales grow, earnings grow. Shares will follow earnings over time. So, we look at it and say, they have, first of all, a lot of money on the balance sheet, isn't it something like $32 billion?
Harjes: I have this right here, $14.7 billion in cash. That's without their short-term investments.
Campbell: Yeah, and securities that they can sell, as well. And they spend a ton on research and development. I think their run rate now on research and development is something like $3.6 billion. So, they have a pipeline and they're working on that pipeline. So, you say, maybe new drugs coming out of that pipeline, or acquisitions, because of all this cash, can spark growth, right?
Harjes: Yeah. So, you have the organic side and you have the inorganic side. And when you look at the organic side, what are they actually developing themselves, they do have some exciting things going on. But it's going to be a while before we hear about any of them. And so, that's when you get this pressure for the inorganic growth. And there has been so much speculation about, who is Gilead going to buy, when are they finally going to pull the trigger? I do think, at least in the short term, that's the catalyst to watch. What are they going to do with that money? Who are they going to buy? When will they actually make a move to try to bolster their portfolio and get some more internal catalysts to get revenue moving in the right direction before, say, 2020, when they start getting data for all of the really awesome drugs in their pipeline that are not quite ready for market yet.
Campbell: Yeah. If you look at the lead candidates in the pipeline, you have filgotinib, which is the autoimmune disease drug they're working with Galapagos on. Data for that should start rolling in, I think, as early as next year, stretching through 2020, depending on the indication and the trial we're talking about. Then, there's another one for something called NASH, which is another liver disease, but, again, we won't see data from that until the 2020s as well. So, you look at that and say, OK, there's not a whole heck of a lot that's going to, as far as drugs that are going to hit the market that could really make a big deal here. So, what would be the M&A target? Can they buy something? Then, assuming they can cut a lot of overlapping expenses, maybe they can get operating margin moving in the right direction again. But only time will tell. We have to see how that plays out. And Gilead is being patient. They have the war chest, and they have the money, but they look at it from an operational standpoint, saying, ""I don't want to pay too much for this company when three years from now, I could get it for a bargain.""
Harjes: Well, that, and they look at their own company and they say, ""Holy moly this is cheap."" Gilead spent $14.8 billion on shareholder rewards in the last 16 months. $12 billion of that was on share repurchases. So, this company is not interested in buying other overpriced assets when it could just buy back its own stock at pretty low valuations.
Campbell: Yeah. Although, you take the other end of that coin and say, from a shareholder standpoint, is that the best use of your dollars? So far it has not been, because shares have still declined. So, you brought back a lot of shares at a lot higher prices. Has that been the best use of your money, where if you had gone out and bought something like Medivation or something, to kick-start growth that way, would that have been a better reward for shareholders? Who knows. We don't know. The reality is, this remains a biotech behemoth. They're not going away. At some point, somewhere down the line, they're going to do something that will restart growth. The question will be, where will shares be at that point? Is this the low? Was $80 the low? Was $90 the low? I don't know.
Harjes: Right. And when they do it, we will absolutely have you covered here on Industry Focus. Thank you so much, Todd, for all of your thoughts today, and I'll talk to you next week.

But, it dropped below $10 or something like that. It's been tough sledding for the stock, and there's a lot of reasons, we covered it before, Kristine, on the show. As a refresher, there was a lot of pushback regarding pricing decisions that they had made in the past that led to scrutiny that led to the closure of their specialty distributor, pushback as a result of that and declining sales volumes has caused income to drop, and as a result, there has been a lot of fear that they might have a hard time paying off their debt load. So, heading into the first-quarter earnings results, a lot people were watching to see what management would say, and see if they provide some indication that the corner is turning.
Harjes: By the reaction the market had, it seemed like people were pretty happy with their earnings, which they released on May 9. The stock is up 40% since they released those earnings. On the surface, the headline was pretty good. They had their first profit that they posted in six whole quarters, but there's kind of an asterisk there where they reported a GAAP net income of $628 million, but that was almost entirely due to this one-time tax benefit of $908 million, which was attributed to non-cash internal restructuring. So, they're fudging the numbers a little bit, not in a nefarious way, but there's a huge difference for this company between their GAAP numbers and non-GAAP numbers.
Campbell: Right. You almost have to be a CPA to be able to dig in here and figure out what's going on behind the scenes, to have to reconcile the GAAP versus non-GAAP and figure, quarter for quarter, what is going on with the company. You mentioned that they'd reported top-line GAAP profitability. As you've said, that was all due to this one-time benefit from this tax item, so don't count on that going forward, you have to X that out. Revenue, the top line, did fall again, it was down 11% to $2.11 billion. So, you still have deterioration in the top line, and we'll get into why in a minute. But, without a doubt, Kristine, if you were a shareholder going into earnings last week, right now you're smiling a lot bigger than you were last week, especially if you were one of the fortunate ones to have been able to pick this thing up at the low.
Harjes: Right, indeed. This is something where, I guess, if you timed it correctly, you could have made quite a profit. But I do imagine that the vast majority of shareholders are still sitting on a pretty big loss here.
Campbell: I think that's probably true. Unfortunately for those long-term investors who have ridden the stock down, when I dug into the numbers and started really going through the puts and the takes here on balance, I had to walk away a little bit unimpressed. Their crown jewel is Bausch + Lomb. That's their biggest segment, it does $1.1 billion roughly in quarterly sales. But that crown jewel gained no ground year over year. Sales were essentially flat on a reported basis. Sure, if you back out currency, operational growth was 4%. But currency is something that these international companies deal with quarter after quarter. The reality is, sales for Bausch + Lomb were flat. And if you dig a little bit deeper, U.S. volume for Bausch + Lomb declined, and was offset by some emerging markets, overseas growth. So, Bausch + Lomb, we'll call it a push for the quarter. Branded Rx, sales continued to drop there, fell 9% to $604 million. Then, because of generic competition and some pricing woes, their U.S. diversified business got absolutely clobbered. Sales fell 37% year-over-year to $355 million. Unfortunately, the threat of generics is not going away -- this is going to remain a headwind for this company over the coming year.
Harjes: Right, pricing is going to be a huge issue for them, because of all the bad publicity that they got way back in 2015 when this whole controversy started about their cardiovascular drugs that they boosted the prices on by hundreds and hundreds of percents. They kind of can't do that anymore, and that was a big part of how they were making money. So, now, when you look at their portfolio, a lot of drugs are either hit or about to be hit by patent expirations, and they don't really have the option anymore of raising prices to compensate for lower volume.
Campbell: Yeah. So, we have a situation where we have a company that's still seeing a lot of pressure on its top line. There was a little bit of evidence of some price stability in Branded Rx, to be fair. So, that's somewhat good news. But, on balance, you look at this, and it's like, this wasn't that great of a quarter. Why on earth is the stock up 40-50% since the report?
Harjes: Yeah, and I know you have an interesting theory about this.
Campbell: Yeah. It's really all tied to the size of the short position, in my view, and a $50 million bump-up in its guidance for the year in EBITDA.
Harjes: Right. Let me take the latter thing you just said and expand on that a little bit. People are very concerned that Valeant is going to default on its debt. It has a humongous debt load, and for a long time, it's been kind of unclear whether or not they would be able to meet this debt. So, when they say they are going to up their EBITDA guidance, that is a great thing for people that are concerned about the debt. So, when you trace that back to the first thing you said, which was the short position, that is where you start to get people potentially exiting their shorts.
Campbell: Yeah. Again, as a refresher, if you're going to short a stock, you're borrowing from your broker, you'll selling it with the hope of buying it back cheaper and then replacing the shares that you borrowed. So, as a stock rallies and people who have sold it short see that happening, you end up getting a domino effect where, ""Oh, it's rallying, I have to cover, now I have to cover, and I have to cover."" If you look at the short ratio, which is simply the percentage of shares that are sold short toward the shares that are out there that can trade, it was at a record high leading up to the earnings. A record high.
Harjes: Right, 15%.
Campbell: Yeah. So, it wouldn't take a lot to move the needle here. And it really didn't. The bump up in EBITDA guidance was $50 million. They went from basically guidance of 3.5%-3.65% to 3.6%-3.75%, a $50 million improvement. But, again, the big thing here is the debt. They have over $30 billion in debt. They've knocked about $3 billion off of that. That's good news, because what that does it is it, theoretically, improves their interest coverage ratio. And now we're getting really wonky.
Harjes: It's a wonky company.
Campbell: Yeah. When you have all these creditors, they want to know they're going to be paid back. And one of the ways they do that is calculate your interest coverage ratio, which is simply EBITDA divided by interest expense. So, you have debt, you're paying interest expense on it. Are you generating enough EBITDA to cover that interest expense? Typically speaking, if you get below 2:1, it starts to get you a little bit nervous.
Harjes: Right. At the end of Q1, they were at 1.83, which is below that 2 threshold, but it is above what their newly renegotiated level is, which is 1.5, which is what their lenders need to see.
Campbell: Wow. There are so many rabbit holes we could chase here. They had to renegotiate a lot of these covenants lower because they were going to run into a risk of default, because they weren't going to make the 2:1 ratio. So, you had various ratios that range from 3:1 and 2:1. They've knocked those ratios down to 1.5:1, so they're still OK. And by bumping up the EBITDA guidance, that led people to believe, if EBITDA improves, then it's less likely that creditors are going to end up knocking at the door demanding payment, because that interest coverage ratio falls below the threshold. It gets even more complex than that, though, Kristine, because you have to look at where that EBITDA improvement is coming from. And frankly, I'm not convinced that's it's coming from a material improvement in the business.
Harjes: Right, and that's really what it comes out here, to bring it back to a little bit of a higher level -- this is a company that needs to find a way to come up with money. They need to service their debt. They can do that by having a better top line. We've already dug into the different business segments, and it's questionable whether or not they'll be able to do that in any significant way. Or, their other option is, they can sell some of their assets. But everybody else out there that could be a potential buyer for these assets knows exactly the situation that Valeant is in, so they're not going to pay a premium for some of these assets. Then, you get hit with a double whammy, if you're Valeant, of, I'm trying to get a good price for some of my portfolio. In order to get a good price, you need to sell the best stuff, and that's exactly the stuff that's going to bolster your top line.
Campbell: Right. And Kristine, just to make things even worse for them, that has a negative impact on EBITDA. So, you have to make sure you're paying off enough debt to lower your interest expense, at the same time you're selling these things that are generating out earnings. And one of the concerns I have going forward here is, they're selling one of their prized assets, Dendreon, which makes a prostate cancer drug called Provenge, they're selling that later this year, and their EBITDA guidance, it says right in the report that it doesn't include that sale in its calculation.
Harjes: Right. So, take out the sales from Provenge, and all of the sudden you get EBITDA lower.
Campbell: Right. You say, they paid down $3 billion in debt, so their interest expense has to be falling. But, because they had to renegotiate all of these deals, they're ending up having to pay more in interest. So, you shaved $3 off your debt, but at the same time, your interest expense actually went up year over year. Now, eventually, hopefully, if you look at the maturities on the debt, they're pretty manageable until about 2020. But, you have a lot of issues here, and I think it's maybe a little bit premature for investors to look through that report, see shares running, and say, ""Oh, OK, the corner has turned and the stock is going to go back to $100.""
Harjes: And it would be easy to do so, too, because by almost every metric, this is a very cheap stock. It's really just gotten clobbered by the market. But after having this discussion, hopefully it's pretty clear to our listeners that it's kind of for good reason. This could be a turnaround story, but personally, I don't think I would sleep at night if I bought shares of this company.
Campbell: Yeah, it's almost like skydiving without a parachute and hoping someone throws you a parachute and that you'll be able to catch it and open it before you hit the ground.
Harjes: [laughs] Yes, that's accurate imagery. I was trying to come up with something like a treadmill, but I like yours better, let's go with that.
OK, we said we were going to talk about Gilead Sciences, and that was not a lie. It is now time to dive into Gilead.
Campbell: This one hits a little bit close to home for me, Kristine, and I think maybe it does for you too?
Harjes: As a shareholder? Yeah.
Campbell: Yeah. This is a stock that is a behemoth in biotech. And unfortunately, its shares have fallen from $120 to about $65 since the summer of 2015, making the comparison even worse when you look at the fact that the S&P 500 has rallied and has been flirting with new highs. This stock has gotten clobbered. And it's been a tough run for shareholders like me, and I have to -- can we do a little confessional here?
Harjes: Let's hear it.
Campbell: I confess, I made a grave error in the way I normally approach stocks. I usually buy stocks -- we talked about this last week -- based on a particular catalyst, and then when I'm evaluating whether or not to hold the stock, I see if anything's changed that catalyst. Now, normally, if the catalyst has failed to pan out or change, that's a signal to me that I should sell or exit the stock. My catalyst did, indeed, change for Gilead, and I did not sell the stock. My cost is somewhere in the $90s, I'm down 20%-25%.
Harjes: What was the catalyst that you were looking for?
Campbell: I really thought their leadership in developing hepatitis C drugs was going to allow them to continue to innovate and dominate the market, which they have. But I also felt they would be able to innovate shorter and shorter treatment duration, getting it down to as little as four weeks over time from the 12 weeks it is currently. And it does look like that's not in the cards. It's looks like they're slowing down their efforts to continue to move the needle in developing new products for hepatitis C. I also underestimated the negative drag and impact of price concessions they would be forced to make to stay ahead of competitors like AbbVie. And, I also had bought it originally because I had some good thoughts that they would do well with their push into cancer drugs, and unfortunately that was a bust. Yet I looked at it and said, this is still a very profitable company, and now they're paying a dividend, and they have a ton of cash on the balance sheet, so I guess I'll stick around. Obviously, so far, that's been the wrong choice.
Harjes: The thing is, you talked a lot about hepatitis C, and I think that is what most people focus on with this company. But, if you look at what has happened to the company over the course of its HCV life cycle, its first hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, was approved in December 2013. At the time of approval, Gilead's market cap was $114 billion. Today's market cap of $86 billion is 25% lower than that. For me, I look at this company and I just can't help but think that the market has overreacted to its hepatitis C woes. And you're totally right about cancer not quite panning out, but I don't think there is as high hope and drama and expectation tied into its oncology efforts, necessarily, as it was for HCV sales.
Campbell: Yeah. I agree with you, in some respects. But here's the problem: We have yet to find a floor on those hepatitis C sales. In Q1, revenue came in a $2.6 billion across their hepatitis C franchise. That was down from $4.3 billion the year before.
Harjes: Yeah, that's a 40% decline.
Campbell: Yeah, massive drag. As a result, Q1 total sales were $6.5 billion. That was down 16.5%. EPS fell from $3.03 last year to $2.23 this year, ouch.
Harjes: Yeah, and I totally agree that that does hurt. But, I think with this company, it's important to remember that they have other things going on. In particular, their HIV products were very good in the last quarter. And that was how this company really made its name. Its HIV and HBV product sales were up year over year in the first quarter 13% to $3.3 billion. That's a good thing. Sales fell for some of the older products, but it was made up for by the newer ones like Genvoya and Descovy and Odefsey.
Campbell: Right. They've enjoyed a lot of growth, and that's because they reformulated Viread. They made it safer, and now they've been rolling out combination therapies that replace Viread in those combinations with TAF, this new formulation. I imagine that we'll probably see a leveling off in sales growth there once all the combination therapies have been launched. But, yes, they remain a dynamo in that business. It's a great business for them, and it's been a growing business for them, it just hasn't been growing fast enough to offset the slide in sales in hepatitis C. So, you look at it from an investment standpoint now, and you say, OK, well, we know that HIV is going to be stable to growing. That's good. And we know that hepatitis C is declining, and we don't know where the floor is.
Harjes: And that's bad.
Campbell: Yeah, that's bad. So, we say, what's the catalyst, what's going to cause this stock to get back to growth? Because, ultimately, we want to see sales grow, earnings grow. Shares will follow earnings over time. So, we look at it and say, they have, first of all, a lot of money on the balance sheet, isn't it something like $32 billion?
Harjes: I have this right here, $14.7 billion in cash. That's without their short-term investments.
Campbell: Yeah, and securities that they can sell, as well. And they spend a ton on research and development. I think their run rate now on research and development is something like $3.6 billion. So, they have a pipeline and they're working on that pipeline. So, you say, maybe new drugs coming out of that pipeline, or acquisitions, because of all this cash, can spark growth, right?
Harjes: Yeah. So, you have the organic side and you have the inorganic side. And when you look at the organic side, what are they actually developing themselves, they do have some exciting things going on. But it's going to be a while before we hear about any of them. And so, that's when you get this pressure for the inorganic growth. And there has been so much speculation about, who is Gilead going to buy, when are they finally going to pull the trigger? I do think, at least in the short term, that's the catalyst to watch. What are they going to do with that money? Who are they going to buy? When will they actually make a move to try to bolster their portfolio and get some more internal catalysts to get revenue moving in the right direction before, say, 2020, when they start getting data for all of the really awesome drugs in their pipeline that are not quite ready for market yet.
Campbell: Yeah. If you look at the lead candidates in the pipeline, you have filgotinib, which is the autoimmune disease drug they're working with Galapagos on. Data for that should start rolling in, I think, as early as next year, stretching through 2020, depending on the indication and the trial we're talking about. Then, there's another one for something called NASH, which is another liver disease, but, again, we won't see data from that until the 2020s as well. So, you look at that and say, OK, there's not a whole heck of a lot that's going to, as far as drugs that are going to hit the market that could really make a big deal here. So, what would be the M&A target? Can they buy something? Then, assuming they can cut a lot of overlapping expenses, maybe they can get operating margin moving in the right direction again. But only time will tell. We have to see how that plays out. And Gilead is being patient. They have the war chest, and they have the money, but they look at it from an operational standpoint, saying, ""I don't want to pay too much for this company when three years from now, I could get it for a bargain.""
Harjes: Well, that, and they look at their own company and they say, ""Holy moly this is cheap."" Gilead spent $14.8 billion on shareholder rewards in the last 16 months. $12 billion of that was on share repurchases. So, this company is not interested in buying other overpriced assets when it could just buy back its own stock at pretty low valuations.
Campbell: Yeah. Although, you take the other end of that coin and say, from a shareholder standpoint, is that the best use of your dollars? So far it has not been, because shares have still declined. So, you brought back a lot of shares at a lot higher prices. Has that been the best use of your money, where if you had gone out and bought something like Medivation or something, to kick-start growth that way, would that have been a better reward for shareholders? Who knows. We don't know. The reality is, this remains a biotech behemoth. They're not going away. At some point, somewhere down the line, they're going to do something that will restart growth. The question will be, where will shares be at that point? Is this the low? Was $80 the low? Was $90 the low? I don't know.
Harjes: Right. And when they do it, we will absolutely have you covered here on Industry Focus. Thank you so much, Todd, for all of your thoughts today, and I'll talk to you next week. As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

",Valeant and Gilead: Beaten Down Bargains or Truly Terrible?

""The question isn't at what age I want to retire; it's at what income."" -- George Foreman 
George Foreman is on to something. If you think about it, each of us could retire today -- we just probably wouldn't have the kind of income we want or need. Thus, most of us need some more time in which to build a fatter income stream. A powerful tool to help us is the 401(k) account. Just be sure to use it effectively. Here are three dumb 401(k) moves to avoid.

Image source: Getty Images.

Dumb 401(k) move No. 1: Not participating or under-participating
One of the worst things you can do with a 401(k) account is not use it -- or underuse it. There are more than 600,000 defined contribution plans such as 401(k)s in existence, with more than 70 million people participating in them. As of late 2016, there was about $7 trillion in 401(k) plans.
That sure seems like a lot of money, but most accounts are far from able to support anyone in retirement. For example, the average 401(k) account balance in Fidelity Investments-managed plans hit a record average of $92,500 as of the end of 2016. Indeed, income from 401(k) accounts has been estimated to represent about 25% to 30% of overall retirement income.
Thus, it's best to be socking away as much as you can for retirement, whether in IRAs, 401(k) accounts, or elsewhere. One big plus for 401(k) plans is that they have much more generous contribution limits than IRAs (which only accept up to $6,500 in 2017). For 2017, you can contribute up to a whopping $18,000 to a 401(k) account, plus another $6,000 for those 50 or older, for a grand total of $24,000. Maybe you can't immediately sock away $18,000 or $24,000 in your 401(k) each year, but whatever level you start at, aim to increase it regularly. Contributing 10% of your earnings? Try to make it 11% next year. Here's how much you might amass over time:

If you're not contributing the maximum to your account, be sure to at least contribute enough to grab all available matching funds from your employer. As an example, a common match is a dollar-for-dollar one up to 3% of your earnings. If you earn $75,000 and contribute 3%, or $2,250, to your account, you would get another $2,250 from your employer -- and that's free, guaranteed money.

Dumb 401(k) move No. 2: Investing less effectively than you could
The next dumb thing you can do with your 401(k) is to invest in suboptimal ways in it. For example, a 401(k) plan will typically feature default investment choices, and they tend to be conservative ones that won't serve you well if you're young -- and they may not be great if you're older, either. Make sure that you decide how your 401(k) money will be invested. Don't just leave your account plowing your contributions into conservative default investments.
Where should you put your money? Well, it's hard to beat inexpensive, broad-market index funds, such as ones based on the S&P 500 or the total U.S. or world stock market. They will likely outperform most managed stock mutual funds. There are bond index funds, too.
Here are some other tips:

Don't succumb to emotions. If the market crashes and the value of your 401(k) account shrinks, don't panic and stop contributing to it. That's actually an excellent time to contribute more, as stock prices for good companies will be low -- as if on sale. Similarly, don't get caught up in greed, either, chasing after riskier funds that have had a good year. Be patient and you can accumulate a lot of wealth over time.
It's smart to know what kinds of fees you're being charged in your 401(k). You can compare your employer's 401(k) with other companies' at BrightScope.com. If your fees seem steep, let your company know.
Increasingly, many employers are offering the option of a Roth 401(k) account, which accepts only taxed, not pre-tax, contributions. Give it serious consideration, as it offers the chance to withdraw money from your account in retirement tax-free.

            });
        

Dumb 401(k) move No. 3: Interfering with your 401(k)'s growth
Finally, don't interfere with your 401(k) account's growth. Many people cash out their 401(k) accounts when they leave a job. That's a terrible thing to do because it robs your future of retirement dollars that will likely be needed. If you withdraw just $20,000 that might have remained invested for 20 years, averaging 8% annual growth, you miss out on more than $90,000 in future funds.
When you leave a job, you can do well to rollover funds in your 401(k) into an IRA, where fees might be lower and investment options broader. Read up on the rules, though, lest you end up facing a fine for doing it wrong. Another option many have when closing out a 401(k) account is to convert that money into an annuity that will pay regular sums monthly in retirement. If the annuity is from a highly rated insurer, it's like buying almost-guaranteed income that can help you sleep better in your golden years. Just be sure it's a fixed annuity and not a variable or indexed one, as those are more problematic.
Don't borrow money from your 401(k), either, if you can in any way avoid it. Borrowing means removing dollars that could be working and growing for you -- and that may never be repaid if you run into more trouble. (Not repaying a 401(k) loan can result in penalties and taxes, too.)
A last mistake to avoid is not designating one or more beneficiaries. Fail to do so, and the money may go to a party specified by a state formula and not to whom you want. Better still, designate your account as POD or TOD -- payable or transferable on death -- and it will get to your beneficiaries more swiftly, generally avoiding probate. 
",3 Dumb 401(k) Moves
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/14/is-the-marijuana-stock-rally-over.aspx,2017-05-14,"
While technology stocks have led the S&P 500 higher year to date, some of the most widely owned marijuana stocks have stumbled in 2017. Top marijuana stocks including Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG), GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH), and Canopy Growth Corp. (NASDAQOTH:TWMJF) have all lost ground. Does this mean the rally in marijuana stocks is over?
Different approaches, big growth
Pro-pot advocates have enjoyed a tidal wave of support among voters in the United States and Canada, and as laws approving the use of medical marijuana and recreational marijuana have become common, shares in top marijuana stocks shot considerably higher in 2016.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

For example, Scotts Miracle-Gro -- best known for its fertilizer products -- has been making a big push into hydroponics so that it can ride the wave of rising demand from marijuana grow facilities. As a result, Scotts Miracle-Gro shares increased 52% in 2016.
GW Pharmaceuticals has invested big money researching marijuana cannabinoids use as medicine since the 1990s. Last year, it reported positive results from trials evaluating a drug based on the marijuana cannabinoid CBD. In these trials, epilepsy patients were given the company's purified CBD drug, Epidiolex, and they saw 40% fewer seizures per month following treatment. Excitement over these results, plus optimism Epidiolex could receive a speedy FDA thumbs-up, caused GW Pharma's shares to surge 61% in 2016.
Finally, Canopy Growth has delivered investors awe-inspiring returns as it's become Canada's largest maker of medical-marijuana products. A maturing market for medical marijuana in Canada helped Canopy Growth's revenue increase to nearly $23 million over the past 12 months, and plans to pass recreational-marijuana laws in Canada soon helped Canopy Growth's shares skyrocket 217% last year. 
Marijuana stocks struggling
Marijuana legalization still has significant momentum, but investors in these marijuana stocks appear to have priced in a lot of the near-term sales growth for these companies. 
In April, Scott's Miracle-Gro updated investors on the progress its making serving the hydroponic market, and while sales of those products continue to grow, weakness in other parts of its business offset that growth. Hydroponics revenue grew 22% year over year last quarter, and sales are up 13% year to date, but weak sales of the company's other products caused overall revenue to fall 3% from a year ago in the quarter. Unsurprisingly, that news didn't ignite shareholder optimism, and year to date, Scotts Miracle-Gro's stock is down 5.3%.
GW Pharma also updated investors on its first-quarter progress recently. However, since the company is still preparing its FDA filing for Epidiolex, there was little new news reported that could send shares to new highs. As a result, investors remain in watchful-waiting mode ahead of an eventual FDA decision, and its shares have fallen by more than 5% this year.
Investors have also lost some of their appetite for Canopy Growth's stock this year. The company's recent quarterly performance shows its continuing to win customers and grow revenue, but shares have taken a hit following industry recalls tied to the use of banned pesticides. Canadian regulators have since announced a shift to mandatory testing for pesticides, but the overhang has still contributed to a 16.4% decline in Canopy Growth's shares in 2017.

Where we go from here
The marijuana market could be massive. However, it will take time for this market to develop, and it's possible that past marijuana stock winners won't be the best marijuana stocks to own in the future.  
Undeniably, this market is growing very quickly, but it still faces hurdles. For instance, Donald Trump's election as U.S. president has sent shock waves through the industry because his past comments haven't been overly supportive of marijuana legalization. Those worries increased further when Trump picked marijuana foe Jeff Sessions to be his attorney general.
Overall, risks from marijuana-industry growth pains suggest all but the most risk-tolerant investors ought to concentrate on other investment ideas, at least until this industry matures a bit more.

When it comes to picking stocks, sometimes it's better not to outthink yourself. The names you tend to see all the time on supermarket shelves and highway signs are there because they are established businesses with a massive presence and strong brands. 
Turns out, those characteristics can also help reveal solid dividend stocks.
Here's why our contributors think Clorox (NYSE:CLX), AB InBev (NYSE:BUD), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) are all more than a pretty logo, and they might be good additions to your portfolio.

The world's largest brewing company
Keith Noonan (AB InBev): When it comes to brand and distribution strength in alcoholic beverages, no company can match AB InBev, and these advantages suggest that the beer giant has the potential to deliver a rare combination of impressive growth and income generation over the long term.
Last year saw the company complete its acquisition of SAB Miller, bringing brands including Miller, Blue Moon, and Foster's under a corporate umbrella that already included Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Busch. All told, the company now has over 500 alcoholic beverage brands, with 18 of these brands each generating over $1 billion in annual retail sales. 
The merger also looks to create ongoing infrastructure synergies, with AB InBev reporting $252 million in merger-related cost savings in its last quarter and anticipating that the integration of the businesses will result in an additional $1.75 billion in expense savings over the next three to four years. SAB Miller's position in growth-rich markets including Africa and South America should also work to offset AB Inbev's soft performance in the North American market in the short term while paving the way for long-term growth. 
Looking at the returned income component, AB Inbev's dividend yields roughly 3.6% -- a level that should look plenty tasty to income investors. The company has only distributed a dividend for seven years, but it's been aggressive in raising its payout over the stretch and plans to continue boosting its dividend. While management has stated that payout growth will be more modest in the short term as AB Inbev pays down debts, the stock already packs a potent yield and its potential for capital appreciation further sweetens the pot.
Cleaning up with dividends and growth
Rich Duprey (Clorox): Even a dummy should be able to see that a company that's raised its dividend every year for the past 40 years has a good chance of cleaning up tomorrow too. Bleach maker Clorox has done just that, most recently hiking its dividend another 5% to $0.84, which should push its yield to over 2.5% at current prices.
Although best known for its namesake bleach, Clorox actually owns a portfolio of leading brands in a number of consumer goods categories, including Brita water filters, Pine-Sol and Tilex cleaners, Kingsford charcoal, and Burt's Bees lip balm. More than 80% of Clorox's sales are generated from brands that hold the No. 1 or No. 2 market share positions in their respective markets.
In its recent earnings report, sales rose more than 5% to $1.48 billion, in line with analyst consensus views, on a 7% increase in volumes, while earnings of $1.31 per share beat out expectations by a penny. As a result, it raised the low end of its full year profit forecast to a range of $5.25 to $5.35 per share from previous guidance of $5.23 to $5.28 per share.
Now it's true that Clorox is priced like the dividend aristocrat it is. Although its stock trades at around the same multiple as the broad market index, it also goes for three times sales and nearly 100 times the free cash flow it generates. That does make such a mature, stable performer like Clorox seem expensive.
Yet the company has easily outpaced the S&P 500 over the past decade and its 167% total return over that time frame gives investors seeking both income and price appreciation a solid foundation. Certainly Clorox will experience periods of softness, particularly as a strong U.S. dollar pressures exchange rates, but because its products span so many parts of our daily lives, Clorox should be a steady, smart performer for your portfolio.

Milk & sugar?
Dylan Lewis (Starbucks): You pass one on your way to work, and your way to the gym... and on your way home even if you take the backroads shortcut nobody else knows about. Starbucks is everywhere, and the company's strategy of absolute ubiquity has turned the coffee brand into a cash cow business and regular part of most people's mornings. 
In its most recent earnings report, the company showed all the markings of a strong business, beating top- and bottom-line estimates with growth of 6% and 13%, respectively. And yet the market said ""meh"" because of 3% same-store-sales growth and the fact that management revised earnings guidance down for the full-year. That change in the forecast was due to the company's plans to invest in itself, continuing to make upgrades in its digital offering and more niche concept locations -- both long-term plays that investors should be happy about. 
The coffee maker has other levers to pull: comps in China were up 7% last quarter, and the company estimates they open a new store in the country every 15 hours, a clip management intends to maintain for the forseeable future. 
Income investors might scoff at Starbucks' 1.6% yield, but the company has aggressively grown its dividend since initiating it in 2010. With the company currently paying out less than half of earnings via dividends, there's still plenty of room for that to grow. 
Often dividend payers are staid, older businesses, but Starbucks offers investors the potential for dividend growth and meaningful share price appreciation. Not a bad bundle to take with you on your way to work.  
 
                        
                    
                ",3 Dividend Stocks for Bright Investors
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/17/like-dividends-i-bet-youll-love-these-3-stocks.aspx,2017-05-17,"
One of the joys of investing in stocks is watching dividend payments roll in quarter after quarter. Giant capital gains from growth stocks may be more exciting, but a reliable and growing stream of dividend payments, reinvested in more stocks, unleashes the true power of compounding. Dividends have accounted for nearly half of the total return of the S&P 500 Index over the past 25 years. You ignore them at your own peril.
If you're looking to add some solid dividend stocks to your portfolio, I have a few ideas. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), all of which I own in my own portfolio, are some of the best dividend stocks available.
A string of bad news
Shares of IBM have dropped about 15% since peaking earlier this year, driven down by a weaker-than-expected first quarter and news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had sold a substantial portion of its stake. IBM's transformation is showing signs of progress, with adjusted earnings expected to return to growth this year. But five straight years of revenue declines wasn't what Buffett was expecting.

Image source: IBM.

This drop in the stock price and a dividend bump in April have pushed IBM's dividend yield up to roughly 4%. The payout ratio sits at 43% based on the company's earnings guidance for this year, giving IBM the ability to continue to raise the dividend going forward even if earnings growth remains sluggish. IBM has increased its dividend for 22 years in a row, putting it three years away from achieving dividend aristocrat status.
While the pace of IBM's transformation over the past few years has no doubt been frustrating for investors, the company has remained highly profitable even as it invested heavily in growth businesses like cloud computing. Those investments are paying off: The cloud business generated $14.6 billion of revenue over the past year, and IBM's growth businesses now account for 42% of its total revenue. That's not quite enough to offset declining legacy businesses, but the inflection point where revenue begins to grow again should be nearing.
As a dividend stock, IBM offers a 4% yield and a high likelihood of dividend growth. It's not a popular stock at the moment, but the market will probably change its tune once IBM puts an end to its long streak of revenue declines.
A big, sustainable dividend
After years of strong growth, it's becoming increasingly clear that the market for automobiles in the U.S. has peaked. Rock-bottom interest rates have helped automakers sell cars over the past few years, but the prospect of higher rates and a flood of off-lease used cars pushing down prices could spell trouble in the near future.

Image source: GM.

The uncertainty surrounding the automobile market is one reason shares of General Motors trade for just 5.4 times the midpoint of the company's earnings guidance. The market is expecting a big earnings decline, pricing the stock for a disaster scenario. But GM is a far leaner company than it was before the financial crisis. The stock looks cheap under nearly any scenario short of catastrophe.
GM's dividend yield currently sits at 4.5%. More importantly, the payout ratio based on the midpoint of its earnings guidance is less than 25%. It is possible, even likely, that GM's earnings will decline at some point in the next few years. But it would take a massive decline for the dividend to be in danger.
The trajectory of GM's earnings is unpredictable, but with the payout ratio so low, dividend investors have a substantial margin of safety. You shouldn't expect much dividend growth, especially with the company taking advantage of the depressed stock price by buying back shares. But the dividend looks sustainable, making GM a solid dividend stock.

A retail survivor
There are plenty of high-yield dividend stocks in the retail sector, with stock prices pushed down by poor results and competition from e-commerce. Many of those dividends may not be sustainable, so dividend investors should tread carefully. The retail business is undergoing a major disruption, putting dividends that looked safe a few years ago at risk.

Image source: Best Buy.

Best Buy may not look like a great dividend stock, with a dividend yield of just 2.6%. But the company has proved over the past few years that it's capable of going toe-to-toe with online retailers, growing the bottom line despite weak industry demand and inconsistent comparable sales growth. Unnecessary costs have been eliminated, allowing Best Buy to better compete on price, and investments in its e-commerce business have led to consistent double-digit online sales growth.
After a recent dividend increase, Best Buy will pay out $1.36 per share in dividends over the next year, just 35% of its net income in 2016. In addition to a low payout ratio, Best Buy is sitting on $3.9 billion of cash and just $1.3 billion of debt, reinforcing the safety of the dividend. The yield may not be as high as those of IBM or GM, but it should be safe under a wide variety of scenarios, and there's plenty of room for dividend growth if Best Buy can maintain or grow its earnings going forward.
",Like Dividends? I Bet You'll Love These 3 Stocks
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/16/better-buy-kimberly-clark-corporation-vs-philip-mo.aspx,2017-05-16,"
Big consumer staple stocks can often rebound from steep market downturns, thanks to the non-cyclical nature of their businesses. Two top names from that sector are Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), which both recovered from big market meltdowns before.
Kimberly-Clark mostly sells paper-based personal care products, like Kleenex tissues, Huggies disposable diapers, Cottonelle toilet paper, and Kotex feminine hygiene products. Philip Morris International, which was spun off of Altria (NYSE:MO) in 2008, sells numerous brands of cigarettes -- led by its flagship Marlboro brand -- in overseas markets.

Image source: Getty Images.

Both stocks have outperformed the S&P 500's 7% gain since the beginning of the year -- PMI rallied 21%, and Kimberly-Clark gained 13%. However, past performance never guarantees future returns, so we should take a closer look at both companies' growth trajectories, challenges, dividends, and valuations to see if either stock is a better buy at current prices.
How fast are Kimberly-Clark and PMI growing?
Kimberly-Clark and PMI's growth figures are both weighed down by currency headwinds. That's because the weakness of certain currencies against the dollar reduces their revenues and earnings when they are reported in U.S. dollars. 
Kimberly-Clark's total revenue fell 2% to $18.2 billion in fiscal 2016. Sales at all three main units (Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, and K-C Professional) dropped year-over-year. But on an organic basis -- which excludes currency impacts, acquisitions, divestments, and other one-time charges -- its revenue improved 2% on higher shipment volumes. 
For the current year, Kimberly-Clark expects sales to rise 1%-2% as reported, and 1%-2% growth on an organic basis. That forecast indicates that its currency headwinds should fade to ""neutral"" levels as the dollar weakens and growth in emerging markets accelerates.

PMI's total revenue, excluding excise taxes, dipped 0.4% to $26.7 billion in fiscal 2016. But excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $1.3 billion, revenues actually rose 4.4%. On a reported basis, revenue rose in Europe and Asia, but fell in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and Latin America/Canada regions. On a constant currency basis, revenue rose across all four regions even as shipments fell across all regions -- thanks to PMI's time-tested strategy of hiking prices to offset lower shipments.
For the current year, PMI expects its sales to rise 4%-6% after excluding currency impacts and acquisitions. The company still sees currency headwinds ahead, but it didn't offer a full-year forecast for its reported revenues.
The challenges and catalysts
The major threat to Kimberly-Clark's business model is competition from smaller brands across the world. Consumers in weaker economies like Brazil and Argentina are more inclined to purchase cheaper generic brands of tissues, diapers, or other paper-based products than Kimberly-Clark's ""brand name"" products.

Kimberly-Clark also faces tough competition in China -- which the company is trying to address with higher-end products like ""premium"" diapers. On the bright side, Kimberly-Clark can always buy out smaller regional brands to expand its market share -- although that could contradict its cost-cutting plans to save about $140 million per year.
The main challenge for PMI is to continue growing market share in countries with declining smoking rates. It also must fend off British American Tobacco (NYSEMKT:BTI), which is scaling up by acquiring Atlria's domestic rival, Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI). 
For now, PMI plans to diversify its business and widen its moat by launching new non-cigarette products like e-cigarettes and ""heatsticks"". However, many analysts believe that the company might need to buy Altria to counter British American Tobacco's growing scale. 




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-31631');
            });
        

Profitability and dividends
Kimberly-Clark's adjusted earnings rose 5% in 2016, thanks to its aforementioned cost-cutting efforts and ongoing stock buybacks. Wall Street expects its earnings to grow 4.1% this year. 
PMI's earnings grew 1.4% in 2016, or 11.8% on a constant currency basis. It expects earnings to rise 8%-11% as reported this year, or 9%-12% on a constant currency basis (excluding a tax charge in the first quarter). The narrowing disparity between PMI's reported and constant currency forecasts indicates that currency headwinds are fading. That might allow PMI to restart its buybacks, which have been halted due to unfavorable exchange rates.
Kimberly-Clark currently pays a forward yield of 3%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 62%. It's hiked that dividend annually for 44 years. PMI pays a forward yield of 38%, which is supported by a higher payout ratio of 92%. The company has raised that dividend every year since its split with Altria nine years ago.
The valuations and verdict
Kimberly-Clark trades at 21 times earnings, which is slightly higher than its industry average of 20. PMI trades at 25 times earnings, which is much higher than its industry average of 16.
Neither stock seems like a great value play with those valuations. But if I had to pick one of these consumer staples giants over the other, I'd stick with Philip Morris International. The company's fewer moving parts, wider competitive moat, and higher dividend all make it a more appealing investment than Kimberly-Clark, which is far too exposed to tough price competition in countries with wobbly economies and currencies.

While some Americans worry that the economy and the stock market are just about to crash, both appear to be quite healthy. If we're looking at headline numbers, the stock market has never been higher, and unemployment is at a level that seemed unimaginable eight years ago.
Consider that since October 2009, unemployment has dropped from 10% to 4.4% today (and not just because of a decrease in the labor force participation rate). At the same time, the S&P 500 has more than doubled.
It should be no surprise, then, that a lot of companies were hiring in 2016 -- and some high-profile companies, were on a veritable hiring spree, adding over 15,000 people to their payrolls, according to Monster.com. Below are five of them, two of which may come as a surprise, given that they've been facing serious obstacles.

1. UnitedHealth Group: 43,588 jobs
It's no surprise to see the nation's largest healthcare insurer on the list. Not only is UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) doing brisk business in the age of the Affordable Care Act, but its subsidiary Optum is as well. In fact, 25 of the top 100 hirers last year were from the healthcare sector.
It's far too early to tell whether the American Health Care Act -- otherwise known as Trumpcare -- will pass the Senate, let alone have a material effect on UnitedHealth's future hiring. One thing, however, is certain: Baby boomers are aging en masse, and that represents a huge opportunity for healthcare-related businesses.

2. Macy's: 26,759 jobs
This would be the first ""surprise"" on our list. If you've followed retail industry news lately, then you know Macy's (NYSE:M) has fallen on hard times. Same-store sales fell 4.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2017, and that figure slipped 2.9% throughout 2016.
Perhaps management was just hiring seasonal workers to improve service during the holiday season. And the good news was relatively short-lived: Just after the new year, the company announced it would be closing 63 stores and cutting 10,000 jobs.

3. United Parcel Service: 26,279 jobs
UPS (NYSE:UPS) has long been a proxy for the overall economy. When the economy is strong and consumers are feeling flush, they buy and sell more goods -- and no one delivers more of those goods than UPS.
The company finished 2016 showing strong sales growth of over 5%. Perhaps more importantly, the company announced that it would be investing heavily to meet increased shipping demands, both domestically and abroad. Clearly, those investments include expanding the company's workforce.
The bottom line is this: As e-commerce grows in popularity, so will demand for UPS's services. The company could make the list of top 100 hirers for many years to come.

4. AT&T: 16,421 jobs
It's important to remember that AT&T (NYSE:T) is more than just the namesake brand. The company also owns DirecTV, and it may soon acquire Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) if regulators approve the deal.
But it was the powerhouse wireless division that probably accounted for most of the workforce growth. After all, AT&T is not the only wireless provider tapping the talent pool: Sprint (NYSE:S) made the 13th-most hires last year, and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) came in at No. 21.
With one-third of all wireless customers counting themselves as AT&T subscribers -- second only to Verizon (NYSE:VZ) -- AT&T is one of the dominant providers of a service that's becoming both ubiquitous and crucial to thriving in today's economy.

5. Wells Fargo: 15,950 jobs
Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons -- namely, for opening at least 2 million fake accounts to meet internal quotas. Remarkably, that didn't stop the bank from adding nearly 16,000 employees. Perhaps some were hired to replace the reported 5,300 that were let go in the wake of the scandal.
It's difficult to say exactly what spurred the hiring, but it's clear that while consumers were angered by the scandal, customers weren't exactly leaving the bank in droves. Have you ever had to change your bank account and all of the related automatic payments connected to it? It takes a lot of moral outrage to make that effort feel worthwhile.
We can't read into these hiring figures too much. When companies hire by the thousands, their growth plans may prove to be a little too ambitious, which can lead to layoffs down the line. Other companies experience natural upswings and downturns in hiring due to the season or the economic cycle. That said, these massive hiring sprees at least show that management is feeling good about the future.

Buying and holding high-quality dividend stocks has been proved, time and again, to be one of the most effective strategies to growing your nest egg. However, as with all companies, businesses that pay dividends come in all varying degrees of quality.
But a growing body of academic literature shows that owning safe, high-quality stocks produces above-average risk-adjusted returns. With that in mind, let's look at three high-quality dividend stocks -- AT&T (NYSE:T), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI).

AT&T
The highest-yielding dividend aristocrat -- the investing nickname for a company that has increased its annual dividends per share each year for more than 25 straight years -- telecom giant AT&T provides arguably the best mix of yield and dividend growth in corporate America. Its whopping 5% payout is 2.5 times greater than the 1.9% yield from the S&P 500, and the company is poised to continue to grow its prodigious payout in the years to come.
As a quick point of semantics, AT&T's current payout ratio might seem alarmingly high at 95%. However, it's important to remember that the telecom business generates significantly more cash flow than GAAP earnings --  AT&T's cash from operations is $40.6 billion, towering over its net income of $12.6 billion -- so AT&T is still in a perfectly sustainable situation from which it can further grow its payouts.
Part of AT&T's ability to do so lies in its pending acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX). The deal should help AT&T, alongside Comcast, to lead the transition to broadcasting cable services directly to mobile devices through wireless networks. Better still, AT&T and Comcast should enjoy a considerable first-mover advantage against telecom and cable distributors alike in bringing about this shift. The deal should also help AT&T increase its average revenue per user, a common industry stat, while possibly positioning the dividend titan to bring many new customers under its fold as well.

Procter & Gamble
The past several years have been challenging for consumer-goods leader Procter & Gamble, which has seen its shares trail the market over the past one, three, and five years -- before including the effect of dividends. However, it's as a dividend stock that P&G truly shines. The company remains one of the most vaunted dividend-growth stocks in corporate America, having increased its annual payouts for 60 years in a row. 
P&G controls 22 brands that generate over $1 billion in annual sales and an additional 19 brands that produce $500 million or more. Given this brand consciousness and clout with retailers, pricing power isn't the issue facing the company. Rather, the company has been plagued by sluggish top-line growth; its five-year average annual revenue growth comes in at negative 4.2%. 
Looking to the future, its multi-year cost-cutting initiatives appear poised to finally bear fruit; the company pledged to shed $10 billion in costs and sell off around half of its brand portfolio to double down on its most productive products. Analysts see EPS growth returning this year and sales growth reigniting next year. 
As a mature company, P&G isn't going to produce consistent sales and earnings growth; rough patches will occur from time to time. It should be noted that P&G's current 74% payout ratio doesn't give the company a ton of wiggle room to raise payouts without growing its profits. Unlike AT&T, Procter & Gamble's cash flows from operations are not several times higher than its reported profits. However, its favorable economics, 3.1% current yield, and track record of dividend increases still make it one of the safer dividend stocks on the market today.

            });
        

Crown Castle International
Lastly, cell-tower and fiber infrastructure REIT Crown Castle International enjoys some of the most favorable income-producing characteristics anywhere. The beauty of the company's business model lies in its low marginal cost structure, which is just a fancy way of saying that new customers that use its communications infrastructure cost the business nearly nothing and, thus, are almost entirely pure profit for the company. 
Crown Castle International should see continued demand for its services as demand for wireless network capacity surges in the years to come (see AT&T as just one example). Beyond the demands that wireless cable should create, new entrants, especially tech companies, clearly harbor ambitions to disrupt the telecom industry.
Better still, its favorable economics make it strong bet to experience considerable dividend growth in the coming years. Since it converted into a REIT in 2014 -- a legal status that requires it to pay out at least 90% of earnings through dividends -- Crown Castle International has grown its quarterly per-share payouts from $0.35 to $0.95. With a 3.8% dividend yield today, Crown Castle is a compelling income investment for those seeking safe, steady dividend appreciation.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/08/why-stratasys-stock-popped-21-in-april.aspx,2017-05-08,"
What happened
Shares of Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) jumped 20.8% in April, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The diversified 3D printing company's stock has been soaring in 2017 -- it's up 60.3% through May 5.
For context, shares of main rival 3D Systems climbed 5.8% in April and are up 28% in 2017. The S&P 500 returned 1% in April and has returned 7.9% so far this year.

Data by YCharts.
So what
We can probably attribute Stratasys stock's strong performance in April to a few factors. The biggest one is likely a Wall Street analyst upgrade: The analyst at Piper Jaffray who follows the stock upgraded its rating from neutral to overweight on April 18.  The stock surged to a closing gain of 11.6% on this day and continued to drift higher throughout the month, suggesting that the upgrade's effect was longer lasting that just the one day. 
It also seems likely that Stratasys stock bounced back a bit in April after being driven down -- perhaps too much -- on March 9 after the 3D printing company released fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 earnings. It probably wasn't the quarterly results that disappointed investors and caused them to drive shares down by 9.4% -- both revenue and adjusted earnings per share came in higher than Wall Street was expecting -- but the lighter-than-anticipated revenue and earnings guidance for 2017. 
A third possible -- but unlikely, in my opinion -- factor boosting Stratasys stock in April was the announcement on April 4 by UK-based LPW Technology that it had received a strategic investment from Stratasys. LPW produces metal powders and provides related solutions for industrial metal 3D printing. The stock didn't move when this news was announced, which is why I don't think it was a factor in the stock's April performance. That said, it was a good move by Stratasys, as the metals space is the fastest-growing space within the 3D printing sector.

Now what
Existing Stratasys investors are surely pleased with a 21% gain in just a single month. However, investors shouldn't change course based on the rise in Stratasys' share price in April. Nothing material has changed regarding the company's business performance or outlook. Granted, the LPW investment was a smart move, but an investment in what appears to be a relatively modest-sized company probably isn't going to move the needle for a company of Stratasys' size -- at least not for a while.  
Investors, however, will soon be getting some very material news: Stratasys is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2017 earnings before the market opens on Tuesday, May 16. Investors should look for signs that the macroeconomic environment in which Stratasys operates is improving, as the company along with its peers has been struggling to grow revenue over the last two years.

The market is doing historically very well these days -- so well that many investors are wondering if maybe they should try and wait for the next correction before buying in.
On this episode of Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann explain why it's not a good idea to try and time the market, even when a correction seems imminent. Find out why so many of the most successful investors strongly urge against market timing, what dollar-cost averaging is and how investors can use it to diversify their investments across time, and much more.

This video was recorded on April 21, 2017.

Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, April 21, and we're talking about timing the market. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined in studio by Motley Fool premium analyst David Kretzmann. David, how's it going? 
David Kretzmann: It's going well, it's a Friday so I can't complain.
Lewis: And we have a listener question to talk about. Those are my favorite episodes.
Kretzmann: Me too. It's a lot of fun and I'm excited to dive in!
Lewis: We got a question from Hunter, one of our listeners, a while back. It took a little time to get back to him, but I think the reward for taking time and waiting is, we'll wind up doing a podcast episode on it. So, sorry, Hunter, you're finally getting the answer that you asked for.
Kretzmann: We're coming around.
Lewis: He wrote into the show and asked, ""The stock market seems to be highly overvalued. From what I last read, the long-term average of the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 has been about 15, and now it's over 26. Would now still be a good time to invest during this bull market, or would it be better to sit on some cash and wait for a while and hopefully see that market correction and invest then?"" I love this question, and, broadly, I love getting listener questions. If someone out there is thinking something, chances are there are dozens or hundreds of Fools all thinking the same thing. Hunter, thanks for writing in. If other people have questions, industryfocus@fool.com. Let's jump right into it, David. He's talking about market timing. I think this is something that's on a lot of people's minds. If you consume financial news at some point over the last year, you've probably seen something along the lines of, ""The market is due for a huge correction,"" right?
Kretzmann: You're probably been hearing that since 2009, since the Great Recession. It is a common fear, especially when you've had a multiyear bull market, and you have stocks hitting fresh highs on what seems like a pretty regular basis. We haven't had many 10% sell-offs over the past seven years. It's a good question, and it's something to keep in mind as an investor. On average, the stock market declines about 10% every 11 months, or about every year. Then, you'll have a bigger 20%, 30% or more decline every three to five-plus years. As an investor, you want to expect the market to go down. That's just part of the price you pay as an investor to get historically above-average returns with the stock market. But, I'll take a contrarian point here, since we will be talking about some of the potentially bearish indicators. Going forward right now, the market looks historically a little pricey when you look at the P/E ratio of 26. As you mentioned, the historic ratio tends to fall a little closer to 15 or 16 or 17. The forward P/E ratio of the S&P 500 right now is 18. That means, based on what analysts are expecting, the S&P 500 is expected to earn over the next year, right now the market is priced at 18 times those forward earnings. That shows that expectations are pretty high that growth will continue for the companies in the index. That's one angle. On a forward basis, if these companies can continue to grow, maybe they can grow into the valuation, and you don't necessarily need a big sell-off to revert back to those historical averages. That's one angle.
A couple other things we're actually going to talk about on Motley Fool Money today as well, on our radio show, the housing market is still below its historical averages. The housing market has slowly but surely been recovering since the Great Recession. But housing starts, which basically means the construction of new homes, is still below the long-term averages going back to 1960. As millennials now, people between the age of 18 and 34 in the U.S., they're now the largest demographic in the U.S. ahead of baby boomers. As people our age, Dylan, start to get closer to 30, they're thinking, ""Maybe I don't want to rent a house anymore, I want to buy a house or even build a house,"" that does a lot to spur growth within the economy, because there's so much that goes into the purchase and the upgrade on the renovation of a house. That's something that can drive economic growth and spending over the long term. Just a couple things there. Yes, on the surface level, the market does look pricier than normal. But there are some factors that make me think, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to have a huge crash right away. That's not to say that's not going to happen. As I mentioned before, you want to be prepared as an investor for some sort of sell-off down the road.
Lewis: I think, to add to that, you look back over the last year and a half or so, and the market has navigated what I would say are two major shocks to the system, one of them being Brexit, and the other one being the election of Donald Trump. Two big surprises that the market really wasn't anticipating. And yet, it has weathered it and continued to grow at this really great rate. I will lay out the argument for why there's probably a correction coming at some point in the next decade to 20 years, and what the financial media narrative has been. For people that aren't familiar, basically, the gist of it is, because of quantitative easing, which is basically the Fed getting money into the economy, making borrowing very cheap, interest rates have been historically low. They've been historically low for a very long amount of time. Because of those low yields, investors have been pushed into equities because they're looking for better returns. That demand drives up stocks into overvalued territory. That's what we see, that's the gist of all of these research notes that are saying the market is overvalued. Really, that line of thinking totally makes sense to me. My college economics coming back, I totally see the dots connecting there. And Hunter brings up great points with the data here. Typically, the S&P 500 on a trailing basis, P/E somewhere between 10 and 20. 
The problem, though, is that even if you're right with what your thesis is, when it comes to market timing and deciding, ""I'm going to wait three months to do anything,"" or, ""I'm going to sell now because it seems like we're at peaks,"" is you have to be right not only about the thesis, but you have to be right but the timing and when you act on it, and it's really tough to nail both of those things.
Kretzmann: It's really tough. There are some interesting dynamics at play, and it's incredibly difficult to predict where the market is going in the short term. You have a lot of experts from the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, and high-ranking economists who were predicting before Brexit and the U.S. election that if Britain leaves the EU, and if Donald Trump is elected president, there's a very high likelihood that the market will crash. And lo and behold, the market is hitting new highs as a result. It's also interesting to look at what Warren Buffett has been doing. We traditionally see Buffett as more in that value mode as an investor. Between the U.S. election of Trump and early February, he was a net buyer of stocks. He bought over $20 billion of stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which has been an incredible performer, and driving a good chunk of the returns of the S&P 500 this year. If a correction was coming, if a crash was coming, Buffett would be the last person I would expect to be buying stocks, because he tends to be a more conservative investor. To your point, Dylan, I think it's a great point, looking at interest rates. Interest rates are at historic lows. We haven't really navigated through prolonged periods of such low interest rates. When looking at investments, you have to look at the alternatives. If you're not going to invest in stocks right now, where are you going to invest? The U.S. Treasuries or bonds are yielding 2% to 3%, 10-Year Treasuries, which is very low. So, that's not very attractive. You could put it in your savings account, maybe 1%, if you're lucky, or less. So, you have to look at the alternatives. So, it's understandable to see why people are looking at the scope of investment possibilities right now. And they're gravitating toward stocks, even though, yeah, they look, on average, pricier than they typically have been. But compared to everything else, it still looks more attractive.
Lewis: Yeah. Bringing it back around to some historical examples, Hunter's question reminded me of news that was swirling in early 2016. I'm sure you remember this. There were several big banks, RBS (NYSE: RBS) was one, I think Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) was another, they put out research notes in January, and they were basically urging their clients to sell stocks. They were saying, ""We see these cataclysmic issues coming to the market."" It was, again, largely due to quantitative easing stuff with the Fed, low interest rate environments, and what that does to equities over an extended period of time, or else some growth concerns with China at the time. And you look at the run that the market has gone on since January 2016, I think it's up about 20%. I think a couple things that underpin why it's better to stay invested, even with the unpredictability of the market. There's a ton of volatility out there. Since 1928 -- this is a stat that I love -- the S&P 500 has lost 20% or more in six years -- 1930, 1931, 1937, 1974, 2002, and 2008. Aside from Great Depression years, in the following year of each 20% drop, the market has roared back with 25% or more return. So, the good and bad tend to follow each other very closely. 
If you look at things on an individual basis, as well, JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) puts out this guide to retirement every year, it's kind of an overview of asset allocation, different strategies, and they also looked at the impact of staying fully invested versus missing certain days in the market. Over 1996 to 2015, missing the 40 best days in the market takes your returns negative if you had been invested in the S&P 500, and six of the ten best days for the market during that period were within two weeks of the ten worst days. So, individually picking and looking at these individual indicators can be really difficult, and oftentimes the market tends to flip very quickly. Again, getting to timing, it's really difficult to nail that down.
Kretzmann: Yeah. If you're hesitant to buy today, you have to figure out, what would make you a buyer of stocks? Would it be after a 10% drop? A 15% drop? A 30% drop? What are you waiting for to be a net buyer of stocks? And making that kind of timing decision is incredibly difficult. That's why you have great investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch who say, ""Do not do market timing, it's probably the worst thing you can do for your future returns as an investor."" Often, psychologically, when the market is down 8%, you might think, ""Oh, I'm just going to wait until it's down a little bit more, I'm going to wait for it to recover a little bit,"" and you get into these mind games where you're hurting your future returns, because making that timing decision of both when to buy and when to sell, it just raises the probability that you're going to mess up somewhere along the line. As you've outlined in a nice way, Dylan, the key is to be invested through the good and the bad times. I know later in the show, we'll talk about some different ways that you can invest in a way that you're still comfortable and you're sleeping well at night, which is what you should do. 
But the best thing you can do as an investor, the main advantages you have, here at the Fool, we believe, first, in, investing in individual companies. So, you have to factor that in. You're not necessarily buying an index fund, or buying a whole collection of companies. You're focusing on individual businesses. As an individual investor, your main advantages are, you can try to find and invest in and hold the greatest businesses out there -- the Apples, the Alphabets (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the Facebooks (NASDAQ: FB), the Amazons (NASDAQ: AMZN), those kinds of companies -- and then you can also hold for a really long time. On Wall Street, the average holding period for a stock is now less than six months. Back in 1960, it was over eight years. The average holding period for a stock today is weeks or months. But, as an individual investor, you can say, ""I'm just going to tune out that short-term noise. I want to invest in great businesses. I don't care about what's going to happen over the next year or two, I'm more interested in, what is Amazon or Facebook or Apple going to look like in 10 or 15 years, not what they're going to look like in the next year."" So, as an investor, the best thing you can do is lengthen your holding period, or your time horizon. Our former Fool colleague Morgan Housel has done some incredible research on this, looking back at historical S&P 500 data going back to 1870. He found, if you had held a stock for one year, basically looking at every incremental one-year period going back to 1871, if you just held for one year, it's basically like flipping a coin. One year you will be up, one year you'll be down. It's flipping a coin, basically gambling, if you're just trying to predict where things are going to go where things are going to go over the next year. But if you lengthen that out to five years, 10 years, 20 years, the odds of you making money at the end of those longer holding periods increases each time. There's actually been no 20 year period that if you had bought and held the S&P 500 over 20 years where you lost money. That's after inflation. That includes the Great Depression, it includes the Great Recession. Really, the message there is, the No. 1 best thing you can do as an investor to guarantee higher returns is to lengthen your time horizon. 
Lewis: You talked about investing in individual companies. I think that's something that can get lost in the huge macro stories we see. Very often, will something that is a sweeping macro issue really impact a company like Facebook? The fundamentals that underlie the businesses that you're investing in probably aren't touched all that much by something like rising interest rates. Yes, it will at least be something that impacts of broad market, but they still have the user growth they have, they still have the base of advertisers that are happy to put stuff on their platform. So, you have to remember that you're investing in the individual business, and while it's scary that there might be some rumors circulating about cataclysmic stuff going on in the market, the fundamentals of that business are really what's underpinning your investment.
Kretzmann: Definitely. Within the Odyssey II portfolio in Supernova that I head up with a team of a few other Fools, I will admit that we are having a harder time finding glaring bargains with individual companies right now. Stocks are, for the most part, more expensive than they typically are. You get outside of your comfort level a little bit. But we're tasked every month with managing this real money portfolio, and we have to make a purchase every month. The approach we take there is just focusing on the individual businesses. We'll build up positions in companies over time. I think at a time like this, you want to build positions in companies that you'll be comfortable adding to if they go on sale 20%, if they go down 20% to 40%. So, maybe that's Amazon, maybe it's Alphabet. Whatever it is, companies that you feel pretty confident will be around over the next 10-15 years, companies that are generating strong cash flow, maybe they pay a dividend, maybe you start with a small position and then say, ""You know what? I would actually really be happy if I could buy this company for a 30% discount, because I don't care where it'll be in a year or two. I'm more interested in the next five to 10 years or more.""
Lewis: David, we talked about how market timing's hard, and I think that gives a lot of people this impression of, ""What the heck am I supposed to do?"" The market is rich right now, we just talked about that. What's our advice for investors here? We teased it a little bit in the first half. How do you go into these market conditions and think about placing money? You talked about the Odyssey portfolio little bit, obviously, you personally invested as well.
Kretzmann: Yeah. I would say, on a higher level, you want to invest in a way where you're sleeping well at night, you're focusing on the underlying businesses in your portfolio, assuming you're investing in individual stocks, which, you probably are, if you're listening to this show, you're focusing on the long term, and investing in such a way that you see a market drop as an opportunity and not something to fear. There are a few ways you can go about that. One of the easier ways is dollar-cost averaging, where you say, ""Every month, I'm going to invest a set amount."" This is especially easier if you're working in your life and have a regular stream of income that you are contributing every month or quarter to your portfolio. Say, ""Granted, the market looks a little bit pricey now, but I'm going to invest a little bit every month, I'm not going to pay attention to the price too much, I'm just going to find companies that I really like, or maybe an index fund, and I'm just going to invest a little bit every month, every quarter, in some sort of increment that makes sense."" Another approach that we use in Odyssey II is, maintain a cash position. For some people, that might be 10% of their portfolio. If you're really conservative and you recognize, ""If the market goes down 40%  50%,"" which probably will happen about every decade or so. You should assume that will happen at some point. Maybe you want 40% of your portfolio in cash. And you're fine recognizing that ""I might miss out on some of the upside, but I'll sleep a lot better at night, and I won't panic when the market drops."" 
So, it's really just a matter of evaluating your own psychology and psyche as an investor. And you should probably assume you'll be more scared than you think you'll be. Because it's really easy when the market is going up to say, ""Yeah, I got this. 10% drop? Bring it on."" And then it happens and you're panicking, you're like, ""Oh my gosh, I need to sell, I'm not going to buy."" You really want to be cautious with your approach. You want to assume you'll be more scared than you think you'll be when the market drops. Go in with that assumption. But, build your portfolio around the understanding that market drops will happen, but invest in such a way that you won't let those drops get to you, that you'll continue to stay focused on the underlying businesses behind the stocks in your portfolio, because the long-term performance of those businesses is, in the end, what will drive the performance of those stocks. If a recession comes, or a market crash comes, it doesn't matter how great the business is, just about every stock is going to get hit a good amount. That's what happened in the Great Recession. You had great businesses like Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) -- it's coffee, it's not going anywhere, but still the stock got hammered. Again, you want to invest in a way that you're focusing on the underlying businesses, the long-term performance of those businesses, staying focused on the long-term as an investor, and sleeping well at night.
Lewis: Yeah. I think, regardless of market conditions, it's always good to have a little cash on the side, because even in a raging bull market, if you have a stock you really love that reports iffy earnings because of some one-off charges or something like that and the market reacts poorly and shoots it down 7% or something, that might be a good buying opportunity. I know Kristine Harjes, the Healthcare host, did an episode a little while back about the importance of having a watch list, and some cash on the side so that as opportunities come up, you have the flexibility to act on them. I think that's definitely one thing to keep in mind. I think another thing with investing is, yes, it's a bull market right now, but when you're buying shares, I think a next-level investing type thing is, you're buying bits of shares. You don't want to buy your whole position in one transaction. You want to slowly build to the position you want. That gets at that dollar-cost averaging. If you want to eventually hold $3,000 of Facebook stock as currently valued, maybe you invest $1,000 now, $1,000 in a couple months, and $1,000 later in 2017 so that you get that nice blended average of cost, and you're less susceptible to one really high point in the market, and one really high point for Facebook stock.
Kretzmann: Yeah. Diversification is really key on a lot of different levels. First, you want to diversify your portfolio across different companies that you're comfortable with, you believe in for the long term. But what dollar-cost averaging does is it diversifies you across time. If someone started investing in late 2007, they have a pretty bad perception of the stock market, like, ""This stinks, why does anyone do this?"" On the other hand, if you started investing in March 2009, you're like, ""Man the stock market is so awesome, this is so easy, this is shooting fish in a barrel."" But, if you can diversify over time and ease into the positions in your portfolio over time, that way you have less risk as far as time exposure. We commonly think about diversification across the businesses or stocks in the portfolio, but you also want to think about diversification in terms of time, and dollar-cost averaging is definitely one way to do that.
Lewis: Yeah, I think that's a great point. Maybe we can't provide personal advice to Hunter, but I think someone in Hunter's position, where, maybe you're relatively new to investing, you have some cash you're interested in, maybe it's, slowly start to take bites, and get a better understanding of the businesses you're investing in, and maintain some cash position so that as there are deals that become available in the market because of minor dips here and there, you have the opportunity to continue to act on them.
Kretzmann: Definitely, yeah. Like I mentioned earlier, I know I've been repeating myself a lot in this episode but it's such a key point, you want to set up your portfolio in a way that you seen a drop as an opportunity, not something to fear, because the drops are inevitable. This bull market could continue for the next three years, we could have a 20% drop next month. No one knows. Again, even the experts got Brexit and the U.S. election totally wrong. And that was a consensus expert opinion, it wasn't controversial what they were predicting. Just assume, understand that a drop will come at some point. It could be next month, it could be five years from now. But invest in such a way that when that drop comes, you see it as an opportunity, and not a reason to succumb to fear.
Lewis: Yeah. I think that's a good point to end on. David, thanks for hopping on the show!
Kretzmann: Anytime, Dylan. Thanks for having me!

",Why Investors Shouldn't Try and Time the Market
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/16/dividends-are-back-in-vogue-again-for-energy-compa.aspx,2017-05-16,"

Earnings season is in full swing. In this clip from Industry Focus: Energy, Motley Fool analysts Sean O'Reilly and Taylor Muckerman dive into the most important takeaways from the biggest energy companies in the sector -- ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), and more -- and what they mean for the still-struggling sector going forward.



A full transcript follows the video.







This video was recorded on May 11, 2017.

Taylor Muckerman: We'll cover some of the big guys. You had a couple dividend raises, surprisingly.
Sean O'Reilly: No way, who?
Muckerman: Exxon, Phillips 66, and Cabot Oil & Gas, to name a few. No dividend cuts this quarter so far. That's a good sign. I don't know if they should be raising dividends at the moment, but at least we're seeing some stability here.
O'Reilly: They're like Bon Jovi, they're ""Livin' on a Prayer.""
Muckerman: Very strong for earnings compared to last year. They had some easy comps. And the cost cuts are about fully baked in, so the margins are helping out a little bit there. But Exxon's $4 billion profit was a 122% increase from the first quarter of last year, and they almost doubled cash flow.
O'Reilly: That's what I'm pulling up here, I have to see for myself.
Muckerman: Yeah, cash flow of $8.2 billion versus $4.8 billion last year in the first quarter. 
O'Reilly: I have to think, last year, that was helped with the refinery margins. So now, it's a flip-flop of some sort.
Muckerman: Yeah, but they actually produced less oil on an equivalent oil basis, year over year, of like 5%.
O'Reilly: Yeah, there it is. Not that I didn't believe you, but cash from operations over at Exxon, over $8 billion, and capex of $2.89 billion. That's $5 billion in free cash flow.
Muckerman: Yeah. Lowering capex is really helping some of these companies out. You look at Shell, $9.5 billion in cash flow.
O'Reilly: Long term, that's bad. But for now...
Muckerman: Yeah, long term, that could be bad. So, you see Shell covering their dividend with cash flow, and being able to do stuff.
O'Reilly: They bought $3 billion in stock, did you see that?
Muckerman: Who did?
O'Reilly: Exxon. They bought back $3 billion in stock in the quarter.
Muckerman: Oh. That's nothing new for them, to return money to shareholders.
O'Reilly: Yeah. They've literally said, ""We'll take on debt to do it."" [laughs] Remember when [Fool energy contributor Tyler] Crowe used to be like, ""They're just taking on debt and paying it out."" I was like...Exxon is special.
Muckerman: Yeah, they are special, and they're big enough to be special. If you look at some of the sell-offs that we've had in the last couple years, if you take Exxon and Chevron, they account for 40% of the S&P 500 energy sector.
O'Reilly: Oh my gosh. The stock hasn't even fallen that much.
Muckerman: No. They're just so dang big.
O'Reilly: Good for them. Why did you bring up Cabot?
Muckerman: Cabot Oil & Gas? Because they actually raised their dividend, along with Phillips 66 and Exxon.
O'Reilly: Oh, that's right, what was up with that?
Muckerman: I didn't dive too deep into their earnings to be able to tell folks my opinion on whether or not it was prudent. But they're not necessarily as big as the other companies raising their dividend, so it came as a bit of a surprise to me. But you're seeing integrateds, you're seeing refiners, you're seeing upstream oil and gas companies. So, there's a decent mix of companies raising their dividends. But then again, nobody has cut the dividend yet.
O'Reilly: Well, they did last year.
Muckerman: This quarter. No, last year...
O'Reilly: Yeah, Cabot was free cash flow positive. $269 million cash from operations in the quarter, $208 million capex.
Muckerman: Yeah, you saw it last year, Conoco, Kinder [Morgan], Anadarko, Chesapeake, you name it, they were all cutting dividends last year. 
O'Reilly: I have to wonder what's going on in these boardrooms. They're just like, ""OK, one of the reasons people invest in us is for these dividends, let's call a spade a spade.""
Muckerman: Yeah, for better or for worse, investing in energy is dividend-oriented for a lot of people, yeah.
O'Reilly: So, they plugged their noses last year, and were like, ""OK, we're going to cut. We'll probably get a pass because this is the Dark Ages of oil prices.""
Muckerman: Yeah, ""We're not the only company doing it."" Some of them didn't get a pass, though. Some of them sold off quite significantly because of it.
O'Reilly: Yeah, and some went under. [laughs] I have to wonder, you see the capex cuts, and that's going to have ramifications long term. They're not finding more oil --
Muckerman: Not that they're not finding it, they're just not really trying to find it and develop it.
O'Reilly: Yeah. That money will have to be invested at some point.
Muckerman: That's what people are saying. There could be a supply crunch in the early 2020s, is what they're saying, because a lot of the projects that folks were investing heavily in in 2013 and 2012 to 2014 are now coming on line, and they're not replacing that pipeline, so to speak. So, there are some worries. It all depends on how demand fares over the next five to six years, though.

Exchange operator CBOE Holdings (NASDAQ:CBOE) enjoyed healthy trading volumes during the first quarter of 2017, as its earnings report, released on May 11, revealed. Additionally, the completion of CBOE's $4.0 billion acquisition of Bats Global Markets on Feb. 28 provided a material lift to revenue, while broadening the scope of CBOE's markets and trading services.

Data source: CBOE Holdings, Inc. 
What happened with CBOE Holdings this quarter?


Organic net revenue rose $11.1 million to $154.2 million, an eight percent increase, driven primarily by higher net revenue from the company's VIX (Volatility Index) futures products and SPX (S&P 500 Index) options products.


The closing of the Bats transaction on the last day of February added $39.2 million in revenue to CBOE's books in the month of March alone, accounting for 27 percentage points of the company's 35% revenue increase during the quarter.


Despite higher revenue, net income and diluted earnings per share both fell, as seen in the table above. Higher expenses resulted from $65.2 million in acquisition-related expenses, $14.4 million in amortization of intangible assets that CBOE acquired in the transaction, and $9.1 million in accelerated stock compensation.


Previously, CBOE reported under a single operating segment. But following the completion of the Bats merger, the combined company now reports under five distinct segments: options, U.S. equities, futures, European equities, and global FX (foreign exchange). Information on segment results which follows was presented by the company on a pro forma basis in its earnings filing.


Options net revenue of $135.1 million improved 2% from the prior year, largely on increased transaction fee income, as well as higher trading volume in SPX options.


U.S. equities revenue of $72.7 million was virtually unchanged from Q1 2016, as non-transactional revenue offset a decline in transaction-based revenue.


Futures revenue soared by 37% to $28.8 million. Average daily volume (ADV) of VIX contracts jumped 18%, while revenue per contract, or RPC, rose by 10%. The $7.8 million increase recorded by the futures segment provided the bulk of CBOE's $11.1 million organic revenue improvement during the quarter. Volatility in equity markets may be declining as of late, yet the appetite for VIX trading continues to swell.


In European equities, a new market for CBOE acquired via the merger, revenue declined 4% to $17.9 million, primarily on U.S. dollar strength versus the British pound.


Global FX, the combined company's smallest segment, booked a revenue increase of 4%, to $10.8 million, which stemmed from non-transactional fees implemented in 2016.

What management had to say 

CBOE's purchase of former rival Bats took up much of the discussion in the company's earnings conference call with analysts. CEO Edward Tilly discussed deal advantages at length. The following excerpt nicely illustrates what CBOE hopes to extract from the tie-up:

First, it grows our company and allows us to scale up, enabling us to increase our profit margins and strategic optionality. The acquisition also increases our recurring non-transaction revenue and further enhances our strong growth in margin profile. Second, it significantly [diversifies] our product line into new asset classes and geographies, creates new revenue sources, attracts new users to our marketplace, and enables us to efficiently provide packaged offerings, particularly for our large customers.
Third, it enhances innovation at CBOE by giving us the opportunity to shape and capture revenue from every aspect of the product development trading cycle. With the addition of Bats' Global ETF listing and trading venues, we can now design new indexes, list them, educate more customers on how to trade them and generate and package market data to deliver incremental revenue and create new products... Fourth, the acquisition grows our customer base and immediately affords us the opportunity to cross-sell additional products and services to more customers.

Looking forward
While the Bats acquisition clearly provides a revenue lift to CBOE, it also extends the scale of the company, and makes it a much more formidable competitor to exchange operator Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ), which itself has recently undertaken acquisitions to diversify revenue and expand services.
For now, CBOE must focus on the hard work of integrating Bat's trading platforms and services. If integration proceeds smoothly, CBOE projects that it will realize $50 million in annual cost synergies from the merger in year three (post 2017 closing), and $65 million by year five. Next quarter will be the first full quarter of combined operations, so shareholders are already anticipating feedback on the integration in the Q2 2017 report, as well as a clearer window into full-year prospects for the combined entity.

Take-Two Interactive's (NASDAQ:TTWO) stock has rocketed 300% over the past five years, which leaves the S&P 500 Index return of 70% in the dust. 
Let's review what happened to assist the stock's rapid ascent, and then we'll evaluate what return investors should expect over the next five years.
What happened in the last five years

Take Two subsidiary Rockstar Games is the maker of the Grand Theft Auto series. IMAGE SOURCE: TAKE TWO INTERACTIVE INC. 

Since the end of fiscal 2012 ending in March, Take-Two has continued to produce games from the same franchise brands -- Grand Theft Auto (GTA), NBA 2K, WWE 2K, among a handful of other staple sellers. The latest installment of the popular Grand Theft Auto series, GTA V, infused new meaning in the word ""best-seller"" with 75 million copies sold since its fall 2013 release. Most game companies are thrilled if a game sells up to 10 million copies. GTA V has consistently delivered big sales numbers more than three years after the game was released, and it still ranks, month-in and month-out, on the top ten video game sales charts. 
In addition to strong sales of GTA V, Take-Two's gross margin has expanded from growing sales of online content, as opposed to reliance on physical sales of game discs which have a lower margin. In GTA V, NBA 2K, and WWE 2K players can purchase in-game virtual currency which unlocks certain features in games. Over the past five years, Take-Two's gross margin increased from 36% to 41.4% as revenue from in-game purchases (or digital revenue) increased from $107 million to $643 million.

Take-Two's cash flow improved along with gross margin, and the stock price soared. The company's market capitalization increased from $1.5 billion to $6.3 billion. Investors had previously valued the business based on its lumpy past and not on the positive changes the new digital distribution strategy would bring to the industry, which caused Take-Two and other video game stocks to be forgotten.

What to expect over the next five years
Investors who didn't catch the stock five years ago should take heart. Take-Two will continue to release new versions of popular games like Grand Theft Auto, which the company refreshes with a new story world and characters about every five years. By 2022, digital revenue should be a higher percentage of the company's revenue as the digital distribution trend continues to grow. 
Take-Two is exploring other revenue channels that could make the company look a lot different (for the better) in five years. The company recently announced the acquisition of Social Point, which signals management's interest in pursuing the profitable growth of the mobile game industry. Take-Two also recently announced the NBA 2K eLeague to enter the wide-open world of e-sports.and characters about every five years. By 2022, digital revenue should be a higher percentage of the company's revenue as the digital distribution trend continues to grow.

            });
        


The stock's PE ratio is 23 times expected earnings for fiscal 2018, in line with the S&P 500 Index. Analysts expect Take-Two to grow earnings 14% per year over the next five years, which I find a reasonable estimate given Take-Two has grown revenue at least as much over the last five years, and there are still opportunities across mobile gaming, e-sports, and in-game content to grow revenue and cash flow.

",Take-Two Interactive Stock Up 300% Over Last 5 Years: What's Next?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/09/why-sturm-ruger-wayfair-and-valeant-pharmaceutical.aspx,2017-05-09,"
Tuesday was another relatively calm day on Wall Street, with the Nasdaq hitting a fresh record but the S&P 500 falling back from its own all-time highs late in the day. With earnings season starting to wind down, investors will now turn their attention to macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, and the potential for a Federal Reserve rate increase in June could become the focal point for market participants for the next six weeks or so.
Yet some individual stocks didn't wait to climb higher, posting good news that excited their shareholders. Sturm, Ruger (NYSE:RGR), Wayfair (NYSE:W), and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Ruger fires upward
Shares of Sturm, Ruger shot higher by 10% after the company released its first-quarter earnings results. The gun manufacturer's performance didn't look all that strong on its face, with revenue falling 3% from the year-ago period and earnings coming in flat compared to the first quarter of 2016. Yet most investors had anticipated a much more substantial pullback in Ruger's business, given that the Republican victory in the 2016 presidential election dramatically reduced the likelihood of any gun control legislation moving forward in the near future. Despite some concerns that weak consumer demand for guns could continue, shareholders seemed happy that the company had managed to hold up this well early on in the year and hope that more optimistic trends will prevail.

Wayfair keeps boosting its sales
Wayfair stock jumped 21% in the wake of the company's first-quarter financial report. The online home furnishings retailer reported nearly 30% growth in net revenue compared to the year-ago quarter, and despite posting a substantial adjusted loss of $0.48 per share, most investors following the company had expected to see even more red ink with slower sales gains. Growth in Wayfair's direct retail segment has come as a shock to many watching the company, in large part because conventional wisdom held that large items like furniture and other home accessories couldn't sell well through an e-commerce channel. Wayfair's experience is throwing that conventional wisdom on its head, and solid guidance for the current quarter suggests that the online retailer's success could continue well into the future.

            });
        

Valeant cleans up
Finally, shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals rose by 24%. The beleaguered pharmaceutical company reported its first-quarter financial results, posting a profit and reversing a year-ago loss. Many shareholders were pleased with the efforts that Valeant has taken to reduce leverage, and the company said that its debt was down by $1.3 billion during the quarter. Declines in revenue and adjusted net income came from the loss of patent exclusivity for a number of its products, as well as Valeant's strategic moves to focus on its core business. Yet Valeant also boosted its adjusted pre-tax operating earnings guidance slightly, and for shareholders who've weathered the storm thus far, the news supports the idea that Valeant has prospects to mount a long-term turnaround given time.

The first rule of income investing is to never chase a high yield. In many cases, an abnormally high yield indicates that a company's business is stagnant, or previous problems knocked down its share price and inflated its yield.Free cash flows also might not be enough to cover a company's dividend -- which means that big dividend cuts could be on the way. 
Let's take a look at three stocks with deceptively high dividends which investors should ignore.

Image source: Getty Images.

Nokia
Nokia (NYSE:NOK) initially looks like a good dividend play. Its core business of telecom equipment has a wide moat, its consumer brand is being reborn with low-risk licensing deals, and its trailing yield of 3% looks attractive relative to the S&P 500's average yield of 2%.
But if you dig deeper, you'll notice that Nokia spent $1.68 billion on dividends over the past 12 months, but had a negative free cash flow of $963 million during that period -- mostly due to its $16.6 billion takeover of rival Alcatel-Lucent last January. Nokia's forward yield also remains uncertain, because it announces its dividend every year at its annual meeting (the next one will occur on May 23). 
Nokia hasn't delivered reliable dividend hikes in the past. It suspended its dividend in 2013, but paid out a dividend of 0.37 per share in 2014 after Microsoft's purchase of its handset division juiced up its cash flows. That payout fell to 0.14 in 2015, but was lifted to 0.26 (with the inclusion of a special dividend) last year. But looking ahead, analysts expect Nokia's earnings to dip 4% this year as revenue drops 5% -- which indicates that a dividend cut could be in the cards.
Vector Group
Vector Group (NYSE:VGR) is a hybrid real estate and tobacco company that pays a forward dividend yield of 7.2%. In addition to that cash payment, it's paid out an annual 5% stock dividend since 1999. This means that Vector ""gifts"" investors with new shares based on their current position each year. For example, an investor with 1,000 shares at the end of the year will receive a 7% cash dividend in quarterly installments and 50 new shares at the end of the year.
Those numbers sound very shareholder friendly, and even more stunning when we notice that Vector's shares have rallied more than 50% over the past five years. But as I mentioned in a previous article, Vector's bizarre business model is actually based on funding dividends with debt as it repeatedly inflates its share count with stock dividends. That caused both figures -- which should ideally decrease -- to skyrocket over the past decade:

Source: YCharts
I think Vector hasn't crashed because its investors are staying invested to continuously collect the cash and stock dividends. But that party simply can't last forever -- Vector generated $126 million in free cash flow over the past 12 months, but spent $193 million on dividends.

Guess
The decline of the retail apparel industry -- which was caused by the rise of fast fashion retailers like H&M, declining mall traffic, fickle consumer tastes, and the growth of online superstores -- turned many apparel retailers into ""accidental"" high-yielders.

Image source: Getty Images.

Guess (NYSE:GES), for example, saw its trailing yield surge from less than 1% ten years ago to nearly 8% today -- buy mostly because the stock lost nearly 70% of its value during that period. Despite that decline, Guess CEO Victor Herrero expressed his confidence in the company's dividend before, claiming that he had ""reinvested 100%"" of his dividends back into buying more stock.
Unfortunately, I don't think it's wise to follow Herrero's lead. Guess finally posted two straight quarters of year-over-year sales growth recently, but comparisons were fairly easy due to a multi-year streak of top line declines. Analysts expect Guess' revenue to rise 2% this year, but its earnings are still expected to fall 23% on markdowns. That bottom line deterioration is a bright red flag for its dividend -- Guess generated a negative free cash flow of $19 million over the past 12 months, yet spent $76.5 million on dividend payments. This means that its dividend -- which hasn't been raised since 2014 -- could be cut in the near future.

",3 Dividend Stocks I'd Never Buy
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/15/why-jc-penney-synchronoss-technologies-and-eldorad.aspx,2017-05-15,"
The stock market started the week strong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 85 points, or 0.41%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each enjoyed similar gains to close at fresh all-time highs, thanks in part to a spike in the price of crude oil following an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia to ""do whatever it takes to achieve the desired goal of stabilizing the market,"" according to Russia's energy ministry.
But several individual stocks were left out of today's positive market action, including J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), Synchronoss Technologies (NASDAQ:SNCR), and Eldorado Gold (NYSE:EGO). Read on to learn what caused these unusual slumps.

Image source: J.C. Penney.

J.C. Penney's painful hat trick
Shares of department-store chain J.C. Penney declined 4.6% today after no less than three analysts downgraded the stock on the heels of its painful first-quarter 2017 results.
Note J.C. Penney already plunged nearly 14% on Friday after the early release of those results, which revealed a larger-than-expected 3.5% decline in comparable-store sales, and a quarterly net loss of $180 million, or $0.58 per share. To be fair, that included $0.71 per share in charges related to J.C. Penney's previously announced restructuring and store-closure initiatives. At the same time, J.C. Penney reaffirmed its full-year 2017 guidance for comparable-store sales in the range of negative 1% to positive 1%, and for adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.45. 
Wall Street obviously wasn't impressed, with downgrades of J.C. Penney stock arriving today from Deutsche Bank, Buckingham Research, and Baird. The sentiment of each downgrade was similar. But more specifically, according to Deutsche Bank's Paul Trussell -- who reduced his rating to hold with a $5.50-per-share price target (from buy and a $9 target previously) -- his original thesis that J.C. Penney would be able to continue outperforming its peers no longer remains intact, as the company faces limited additional cost-saving opportunities and is suffering the same broader retail weakness as competitors.
Synchronoss delays its earnings
Synchronoss Technologies stock declined 7.2% today after the mobile cloud innovation specialist delayed its first-quarter 2017 earnings filing for the second time.
For perspective, Synchronoss shares plunged as much as 53% on April 27, after the company announced that its CEO and CFO were stepping down following a significantly weaker-than-expected first-quarter performance -- and this was especially concerning given that CEO, Ron Hovsepian, only just took the helm following Synchronoss' recent merger with Intralinks Holdings. After offering preliminary results at the time, Synchronoss further told investors it would hold its formal quarterly call on May 9, 2017. But on May 8, the company pushed that report out to this evening (May 15), as new CEO Stephen Waldis and CFO Lawrence Irving were ""working diligently to accomplish a timely filing"" of its quarterly form 10-Q with the SEC.
This morning, however, Synchronoss announced it will delay its official earnings release and quarterly filing even longer, as management ""required additional time to comply with the Company's internal controls and procedures and to review certain aspects of the Company's financial statements and corresponding notes for inclusion in the Form 10-Q."" Among the items being reviewed are ""accounting of certain transactions conducted in prior financial periods.""
This may not be cause for further alarm; Synchronoss' new management may just be opting for an abundance of caution. But given the uncertainty already surrounding Synchronoss Technologies after last month's big plunge and executive departures, it's hard to blame investors taking another step back today.

A big buy for Eldorado Gold
Shares of Eldorado Gold  fell 7% today after the gold mining company announced it will acquire all issued and outstanding common shares of Integra Gold Corp. (NASDAQOTH:ICGQF) it doesn't already own for 1.21250 Canadian dollars in cash -- a 52% premium to Integra Gold's closing price on Friday. It's also good for a total transaction value of roughly roughly CA$590 million, including the more than 62 million common Integra shares (or 13% of the outstanding total) already held by Eldorado. 
Eldorado, for its part, states that the purchase will diversify its own operating portfolio by establishing an operating presence in Canada with ""one of the most productive mining camps in the world."" The purchase could also have ""the potential to add meaningful near-term production and cash flow with modest upfront capital,"" Eldorado says.
But it's also a large purchase given Eldorado's roughly $2.4 billion market capitalization as of this writing. And when the transaction closes, Integra investors will have the option of receiving either the aforementioned cash offer, or 0.24250 Eldorado shares for each Integra share they own. Eldorado also limited its amount of cash payable under the agreement to CA$129 million, or 25% of the total transaction value.
In the end, it's no surprise to see shares falling given that impending dilution. But it may be well worth the price for Eldorado shareholders as the acquisition begins to bear fruit down the road.

Alcohol stocks are often considered non-cyclical and recession-resistant plays. But in 2015, annual global alcohol consumption dipped for the first time in nearly two decades, and the industry faces new headwinds like growing craft beer brands and the threat of higher import taxes. 
Yet alcohol stocks still remain fairly reliable investments for conservative investors, and several of the top names in the industry are also dependable dividend plays. Let's examine three beer stocks which can definitely cover your beer tab every year with their dividends.

Anheuser Busch InBev
Anheuser Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) is the world's largest brewer. The Belgium-based company was created from the mergers of Interbrew in Belgium, AmBev in Brazil, Anheuser-Busch in the U.S., and SABMiller in London. InBev's massive portfolio now includes top brands like Budweiser, Michelob, Stella Artois, Foster's, Cass, and Hoegaarden. To counter the market shift toward craft beer brands, InBev acquired popular craft beers like Karbach, Goose Island, Blue Point, Elysian, and Golden Road over the past few years. 
InBev's quarterly revenue has risen by over 30% annually over the last two quarters, and Wall Street expects it to post 26% growth this year. However, most of that growth can be attributed to the completion of its merger with SABMiller last October. Its earnings are expected to jump 49% this year.
But after those annual comparisons normalize, analysts expect InBev's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 4% and 15% next year, fueled by the ongoing ""premiumization"" of its top beers. That bottom line growth should give it plenty of room to continue its seven year streak of dividend hikes. InBev currently pays a forward dividend yield of 3.6%. Its payout ratio currently exceeds 100% due to the SABMiller purchase, but it should drop to more sustainable levels after its operations are fully integrated. 
Diageo
London-based Diageo's (NYSE:DEO) portfolio of alcoholic beverages includes Johnnie Walker, Crown Royal, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Baileys, Tanqueray, and Guinness. Its vodka, rum, and ready-to-drink sales have been tepid this year, but that softness was offset by robust sales of spirits and beers.

Image source: Pixabay.

Diageo's revenue rose 14.5% annually in the first half of fiscal 2017. Much of that growth was attributed to Brexit fears devaluing the pound, which boosted Diageo's revenue from overseas markets. On an organic basis -- which excludes currency impacts, divestments, acquisitions, and other one-time charges -- Diageo's revenue rose 4%. Its adjusted earnings grew 21% during that period.
Wall Street expects Diageo's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 14% and 19% this year. Diageo currently pays a forward dividend yield of 2.5%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 61%. Diageo has hiked its dividend annually for nearly two decades -- making it a solid pick for conservative income investors.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-84706');
            });
        

Molson Coors
At first glance, Denver-based Molson Coors' (NYSE:TAP) forward yield of 1.8% seems less impressive than InBev and Diageo's yields. Yet Molson Coors has two potential advantages over both companies. First, its lower payout ratio of 17% gives it more room to hike its dividend -- although it hasn't done so since 2015. Second, it pays a quarterly dividend, compared to InBev and Diageo's semi-annual ones -- which might matter to investors who need steady income.

Image source: Molson Coors.

Molson Coors expanded significantly due to InBev's acquisition of SABMiller. To satisfy regulators, SABMiller sold its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. Molson Coors' beefed up portfolio now includes brands like Coors, Miller, Molson, Blue Moon, Bergenbier, Keystone, and Henry's Hard Soda.
Molson Coors' reported revenue (which includes MillerCoors in year-over-year comparisons) fell 2% and its non-GAAP earnings rose 2% last year. But for the current year, Molson sales and non-GAAP earnings are expected to respectively rise 1% and 7% as the company eliminates redundancies and scales up its business.
The key takeaways
Alcohol stocks are decent defensive plays for a volatile market, but they often underperform the overall market. The S&P 500 has risen about 17% over the past 12 months, compared to InBev's 4% decline, Diageo's 10% gain, and Molson Coors' 5% drop. Therefore, investors should note that while alcohol stocks can be reliable income generators, they are often overlooked during bull markets.

Staying invested in IBM (NYSE:IBM) has required a lot of patience. The tech giant has posted 20 straight quarters of year-over-year sales declines, and its stock fell 25% over the past five years as the S&P 500 rallied nearly 80%.
Even Warren Buffett -- who accumulated a large position in IBM as Berkshire Hathaway's first major tech stock -- recently disclosed that he had sold about 30% of his position when the stock hit $180 in February. Buffett told CNBC that he had revalued the stock ""somewhat downward,"" and warned that Big Blue was facing ""big strong competitors.""

That big sale raised major red flags, and many investors followed Buffett's lead, with the stock already dropping about 5% since his disclosure. However, I believe that investors are overreacting to the news and that it could be a big mistake to sell with the herd. Let's take a look at four reasons why IBM could still make a comeback despite Buffett's big sale.
1. It's a cheap stock with a high yield
IBM faces a lot of growing pains, but its stock still trades at 12 times earnings, compared to its industry average of 19. The bears might argue that discount is justified, since investors aren't expecting much growth from the company. 
However, IBM also pays a high forward dividend yield of 3.9%, which is supported by a low payout ratio of 46%. Furthermore, IBM has hiked that dividend annually for 22 straight years. That combination of a low P/E, a high yield, and a stable history of dividend hikes still makes it a solid play for conservative income investors.
2. Its strategic imperatives are still growing
IBM plans to grow its top line again by expanding its five higher-growth ""strategic imperatives"" -- cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security -- to offset the ongoing slowdowns in its legacy IT services, business software, and hardware businesses. That's a tough balancing act, but it's gradually paying off. 
Last quarter, IBM reported that its strategic imperatives revenue rose 12% annually to $7.8 billion, and that the businesses' trailing-12-month sales of $33.6 billion accounted for 42% of its top line. Its closely watched cloud-as-a-service revenue also achieved an annual run rate of $8.6 billion -- representing 59% growth from a year earlier. If that double-digit growth continues, IBM could eventually post positive sales growth again -- which would inevitably lift the stock.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-36685');
            });
        

3. Poised to profit from next-gen technologies 
At first glance, IBM's cloud services look weak compared to public cloud platform giants like Amazon's AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Microsoft's Azure, which both generate much higher revenues than IBM's comparable Bluemix platform.

But IBM still has other cards to play. Its AI platform Watson has already been used for healthcare applications, and it's currently being expanded to the cybersecurity, telecommunications, educational, financial, and mobile app development markets. IBM is also using blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that was originally developed for bitcoin, to secure enterprise networks.
Moreover, IBM is developing the first commercially available quantum computing systems, which can make forward predictions much faster than ""classical"" computers. The company is allowing anyone to run experiments or simulations with IBM's quantum computing services via the IBM Cloud. These next-gen technologies aren't quite ready for mainstream adoption yet, but they could eventually put IBM ahead of the tech curve, which would then propel the rapid growth of its strategic imperatives.
4. Buying other companies could get it back on track
IBM has been divesting a lot of older businesses (like its PC, x86 servers, and chipmaking units) while acquiring new ones that strengthen its strategic imperatives. Its biggest acquisitions in recent years include SoftLayer Technologies, Trusteer, Merge Healthcare, Cleversafe, and Truven Health Analytics -- all of which cost between $1 to $2.6 billion.
However, some analysts suggest that IBM could make a much bigger acquisition to get investors excited again. One common suggestion is Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which has a growing data licensing business and an analytics partnership with IBM.
CNBC's Jim Cramer recently postulated that if IBM bought Twitter -- which has an enterprise value of $11 billion -- it could use ""its ability to keep track of feedback for its customers while using the exquisite direct message function to stay in touch with those clients."" Cramer also suggested that ""in one fell swoop,"" IBM would ""become a lot more social, mobile, and cloud.""

            });
        

The key takeaway
Investors should remember that Buffett still owns over 50 million shares after his recent sale so the Oracle isn't completely abandoning IBM. They should also note that IBM is still a cheap stock with a high yield, and that its shares could rise quickly once its turnaround efforts pay off. Therefore, the worst mistake IBM investors can make now is to interpret Buffett's sale as a sign to completely exit the stock.

Universal Display sees a brighter future
Universal Display shares soared 24% after the company posted surprisingly strong quarterly results and boosted its outlook for the full year. Sales jumped 87% to $56.6 million, blowing past consensus estimates that were targeting revenue of $33.8 million. The display specialist benefited from a near-doubling of material sales, as well as a 32% spike in licensing fees as its customers, including major TV and smartphone manufacturers, ramped up investments in products that will use its technologies. Net income improved to $10.4 million from $1.9 million a year ago.
""It is an exciting time for the OLED industry,"" CEO Sidney Rosenblatt said in a press release. ""We are encouraged by the momentum that we are seeing from our customers as well as from the supply chain that supports the OLED ecosystem,"" he continued.
That firming ecosystem gave management enough confidence to significantly raise its 2017 sales guidance. Revenue is now expected to be between $260 million and $280 million, which translates into growth of 30% to 40%. Its prior official forecast range was $230 million to $250 million, and so Wall Street scrambled to account for the accelerated growth potential by sending shares sharply higher.

Revlon stumbles in its biggest market
Shares of beauty product specialist Revlon plummeted 23.5% following the company's release of its fiscal first-quarter earnings report. The company revealed sharply lower retailing trends for its products in the core U.S. market, which led to a 5.8% overall sales decline. Revlon generated a net loss of $37.4 million in the period as adjusted gross margin fell to 58% from 60%. Sales in the U.S. dove 19% even as international markets logged 10% gains.

Image source: Getty Images.

Executives blamed weakening demand in core beauty categories across both the mass retail and prestige segments, but were encouraged that their share of the market held steady. ""While we are disappointed with our U.S. results,"" CEO Fabian Garcia said in a press release, ""our brands continue to achieve strong international net sales growth across all segments and despite the U.S. retail environment, our iconic beauty brands have demonstrated resilience and have maintained market share in the U.S.""
Revlon aims to restore the brand to sales gains in part by investing in the online channel that's grabbing all the growth right now. It also plans to double down on international expansion, especially in attractive markets in Asia and Latin America.
Finally, Revlon expects operating income to improve as its recently acquired Elizabeth Arden segment raises its profitability toward the company average. While each of those initiatives should help, it's clear that the company risks losing plenty of business as beauty shoppers shift their spending away from traditional retail locations in favor of online purchasing.

Q: Some stocks pay big dividends, while others choose to buy back shares with their profits. Which is better?
Companies can choose to use their earnings in two main ways: They can reinvest in the business, or they can share their profits with investors. Or, they can do a combination of the two.
When it comes to sharing profits with investors, many companies pay dividends, which are cash payments made to shareholders. The other possibility is to buy back stock, also known as share repurchases. The idea behind share repurchases is that if there are fewer shares of a stock, the remaining shares will represent more equity in the company, and will therefore be worth more.
So, which is better for you as a shareholder?
The short answer: It depends. Dividends have the obvious advantage of putting money in your pocket, which you can then choose to do whatever you want with. You can reinvest your dividends, or you can withdraw them from your account. However, keep in mind that dividends are considered a form of income, and can be subject to income tax unless they're paid on stocks you hold in a retirement account.
On the other hand, buybacks have the advantage of not immediately adding to your taxable income, since you don't pay tax on capital gains until you sell.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-27974');
            });
        


Buybacks can also be the better option if the company considers its own stock to be undervalued. As an example, during the past couple of years, there have been times when Bank of America stock was trading as low as half of its book value. So, by aggressively buying back shares, the company was literally buying back its own assets at a fraction of what they were worth.
The bottom line is that if you rely on your investments for income, or if the stock trades for a high valuation, a dividend is probably preferable to you. If you don't, and the stock trades at an attractive valuation, buybacks can be a more advantageous way for the company to return capital.

Q: I'm new to investing. What's a good stock to buy first?
Congratulations! Making the decision to start investing is one of the smartest financial moves you will ever make.
When you're just starting out, you should aim to create a diverse portfolio of rock-solid companies. This should be priority No. 1 before you decide to take your chances on any high-growth or otherwise speculative investments.
My absolute favorite stock for new investors is Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett. Berkshire has a phenomenal track record of producing consistent returns for shareholders, and has grown its book value in 48 of the past 50 years.
The primary reason I love Berkshire for first-timers is that it's like buying a diverse stock portfolio in a single investment. Berkshire owns about 60 subsidiary businesses, including household names such as Geico, Fruit of the Loom, Dairy Queen, and The Pampered Chef. In other words, Berkshire's revenue isn't too dependent on any one industry.
In addition, Berkshire owns a diverse portfolio that holds 45 excellent investments, and is managed by Buffett and his two stock-picking lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. By investing in Berkshire Hathaway, you're also buying a piece of Apple, Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, American Express, Kraft Heinz, and many others.

When you're just starting to invest in stocks, it's often not practical to invest in enough companies to properly diversify your portfolio. And while no stock should be your only investment, Berkshire Hathaway is about the closest thing to a stand-alone stock you can find.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/04/apple-incs-105-dividend-increase-is-disappointing.aspx,2017-05-04,"
As expected, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) updated its capital return program earlier this week, in conjunction with its second quarter earnings report. As part of this update, Apple raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5% to $0.63, effective this month.
Since reinstituting its dividend in 2012, Apple has increased it at an average annual rate of 10.7%. Thus, this year's increase is right in line with the recent trend. Nevertheless, Apple's decision to offer a relatively modest dividend increase is disappointing in light of the company's strong cash flow, low payout ratio, and surging stock price.
The dividend yield is fading
In the past few quarters, Apple has stabilized its revenue and earnings. Looking ahead, the launch of the 10th anniversary iPhone later this year is widely expected to drive a return to strong growth. As a result, Apple stock has skyrocketed more than 50% over the past year.

Apple Stock Performance, data by YCharts.
Not surprisingly, Apple investors are ecstatic about this recent run of strong stock gains. However, one side effect is a decline in Apple's dividend yield. When Apple raised its quarterly dividend to $0.57/share a little more than a year ago, that gave the stock a 2.2% annual yield. By contrast, even after the recent 10.5% dividend increase, Apple's yield has fallen to 1.7%.
Apple now sports a dividend yield that is below the average for the S&P 500 (currently around 2%). The company could clearly afford to pay far more, based on its strong earnings and cash flow.
Apple can afford more
Wall Street analysts expect Apple to post earnings per share of about $9 in the current 2017 fiscal year, followed by EPS of more than $10 in fiscal 2018. That puts its payout ratio at 28% for this year and less than 25% for next year, based on the new annual payout of $2.52/share.

Apple's dividend payout ratio is quite low. Image source: Apple.

To be fair, Apple generates 65% of its revenue outside the U.S. Under current U.S. tax law, it would have to pay steep repatriation taxes of up to 35% in order to use cash generated abroad for dividends. Still, assuming that Apple generates around 35% of its profit in the U.S. (roughly in line with the distribution of its sales), its domestic cash flow would be sufficient to pay a quarterly dividend of up to $0.75-$0.80.
Furthermore, President Trump and congressional Republicans are both eager to implement a tax reform package that would slash U.S. corporate taxes and enable companies like Apple to repatriate foreign cash at a very low tax rate. In a worst case scenario -- i.e. assuming tax reform didn't happen -- Apple could issue some debt or pay taxes to repatriate cash if its dividend were slightly higher than its domestic cash flow.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-82856');
            });
        

Waiting for tax reform
One reason for Apple's decision to stick with a modest dividend increase is that management still thinks Apple stock is undervalued. As a result, the company continues to focus most of its capital return program on share repurchases.
That said, Apple stock isn't as much of a bargain as it has been for the past few years, so the argument for buybacks over dividends is losing strength. Furthermore, Apple could have announced a bigger increase to the capital return program to support a higher dividend without compromising its share repurchase plans.
The bigger issue is that Apple has decided to keep its capital returns in line with free cash flow for now, notwithstanding its enormous cash pile. CFO Luca Maestri made it clear on Apple's recent earnings call that until U.S. tax law actually changes, Apple isn't going to make any major changes to its capital allocation strategy.
If legislators do agree on a tax reform package that eliminates the distinction between domestic and foreign income, Apple would no longer have an artificial constraint limiting its dividend. It could raise its payout ratio over time to 40%-50% -- and possibly even higher -- while dipping into its $250 billion-plus cash reserves to fund share buybacks.
But until the ink is dry on a corporate tax reform bill, it looks like Apple investors will have to settle for 10%-11% annual growth in Apple's dividend payout.

","Apple, Inc.'s 10.5% Dividend Increase Is Disappointing"
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/09/losing-sleep-over-your-portfolio-consider-these-st.aspx,2017-05-09,"
With the S&P 500 near historic highs, many investors are likely losing sleep over the possibility of a major market crash. If that sounds like you, these three resilient stocks might help you rest easier -- Waste Management (NYSE:WM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).
Waste Management
Waste Management is the biggest waste management company in North America. It serves over 21 million customers with a vast network of recycling facilities, landfills, and transfer stations. The company recycles about 15 million tons of garbage annually, and powers around half a million homes with its renewable landfill-gas-to-energy technology. 

Image source: Pixabay.

Waste Management is an ideal ""buy and forget"" stock because it generates consistent growth with minimal competition in its main markets. The company's revenue rose 5% to $13.6 billion in fiscal 2016, fueled by positive yield and volume in its collection and disposal business. Free cash flow rose 18% to $1.66 billion, and its adjusted earnings rose 11% to $2.91 per share. Analysts expect 5% sales growth and 9% earnings growth this year.
Those stable returns enabled Waste Management to hike its dividend annually for 13 straight years. Its current forward yield of 2.3%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 60%, is also higher than the S&P 500's 2% yield. The stock's P/E of 27 remains much lower than its industry average of 42, even though shares have more than doubled over the past five years.
Johnson & Johnson
Johnson & Johnson is another slow-growth stalwart that has recovered from many devastating crashes in its 73 years as a public company. Today, the healthcare giant's business is so well-diversified across the pharmaceutical, consumer healthcare, and medical device markets that it's hard for any major setbacks to leave a lasting mark.

Image source: J&J.

Between fiscal 2006 and 2016, J&J's annual revenue rose 35%, its adjusted earnings grew 80%, and its stock price nearly doubled. Analysts expect J&J's revenue and earnings to respectively grow 5% and 6% this year, despite recent headwinds like currency fluctuations, generic competition for some of its top drugs, and lawsuits regarding some of its products.
That slow and steady growth has enabled J&J to raise its dividend annually for over five decades, making it one of the elite ""dividend aristocrats"" which have hiked their payouts for at least 25 straight years. 
It currently pays a forward yield of 2.6%, and its low payout ratio of 53% indicates that there's still plenty of room for future hikes. J&J's P/E of 21 also remains lower than its industry average of 26, even after the stock's big gains over the past few years.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-24001');
            });
        

Wal-Mart Stores
Wal-Mart might initially seem like a weak long-term play due to the growth of e-commerce giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). But over the past few years, Wal-Mart has taken big steps to ensure that it remains relevant in an e-tailer's market. It invested more heavily in its mobile app and payments ecosystem, added same-day delivery and curbside pickup options to counter Amazon, and offered to match the prices of online retailers.

Image source: Wal-Mart.

Wal-Mart has one key advantage over Amazon -- the ability to use over 5,000 stores and clubs nationwide as a distribution network to counter Amazon's fulfillment centers. It also recently started offering discounts for in-store pickups from online orders. 
The company's turnaround efforts -- which include raising wages, improving training, expanding its e-commerce presence, and reorganizing stores -- have also been widely praised by analysts.
Between fiscal 2007 and 2017, Wal-Mart's revenue rose more than 40%, its adjusted earnings more than quadrupled, and its stock rallied nearly 40%. Like J&J, Wal-Mart is a dividend aristocrat that has hiked its payout annually for over four decades. Its current forward yield of 2.7% is higher than the market average, and is easily supported by its payout ratio of 46%. The stock also isn't expensive at 17 times earnings, which is lower than its industry average of 18.
The key takeaway
There's no such thing as a risk-free stock, but I believe that Waste Management, J&J, and Wal-Mart come close. These stocks might stumble with the overall market during the next big downturn, but they'll likely bounce back as they've repeatedly done after previous crashes.
 
",Losing Sleep Over Your Portfolio? Consider These Stocks
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/08/seaworld-stock-has-a-lot-to-prove-on-tuesday.aspx,2017-05-08,"
Shares of SeaWorld Entertainment (NYSE:SEAS) have fallen out of favor lately. The theme park operator's stock has surrendered more than 5% of its value since posting fourth-quarter results three months ago, even though the S&P 500 has moved slightly higher in that time.
Investors will be tested on Tuesday when SeaWorld Entertainment announces its first-quarter financials ahead of the market open. Analysts aren't holding out for much in what is typically a seasonally slow period for the industry. Wall Street pros are settling for $205.97 million in revenue for the quarter, 7% below where it was a year earlier. They also are bracing for a loss of $0.55 a share, in line with the $0.56-a-share deficit it posted last time around.
The timing of the Easter holiday will naturally weigh on the year-over-year comparisons. The tourist-magnetic Easter break that was celebrated in March last year took place in April this time around. Attendance trends have been generally sluggish, but not having Easter holiday during the first quarter will be a big factor for an industry where the first three months of the year are typically insignificant. SeaWorld generated just 16% of its revenue during the first quarter of 2016, and that was with the benefit of a March Easter. The first quarter accounted for 15% of the annual revenue in 2014, the last time that Easter took place in mid-April.
The steep loss isn't a major concern. SeaWorld has always posted a deficit during the first and fourth quarter when a few of its parks are closed and those that are open draw light crowds. SeaWorld historically more than makes up for the losses with fat profits during the seasonally potent summer travel season.  

Image source: SeaWorld Entertainment.

Coming up for air
The first quarter may be SeaWorld's slow season, but the controversial theme park operator hasn't been dog paddling through its business. China's Zhonghong Zhuoye Group acquired a 21% equity stake in SeaWorld in March, buying Blackstone's remaining stake with plans to push the concept into Asia. Last month, SeaWorld announced that it would be adding a record-breaking river rapids-style thrill ride to its most visited park next year.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-74514');
            });
        


Analysts are torn in sizing up SeaWorld's prospects for investors. Three Wall Street mavens initiated coverage of SeaWorld stock last month with varying perspectives. Michael Swartz at SunTrust is going with a buy rating and $22 price target, feeling that the out-of-favor company can return to peak EBITDA levels by 2019.
Steven Wieczynski at Stifel has a slightly more ambitious price goal of $23 to go with his buy rating. SeaWorld is in the process of trying to shake off protesters who have been effective in thwarting attendance growth by adding more rides and attractions that don't center around marine life in captivity. 
Christopher Prykull at Goldman disagrees with Swartz and Wieczynski. He has a sell call on the stock and a $16 price target, concluding that the stock offers a weak risk/reward proposition for investors. 
They can't all be right, and on Tuesday morning, at least one of them will be wrong -- for now.

As for individual stocks, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) made big moves following their quarterly earnings reports.
Tesla's Model 3 update
Tesla stock fell back below $300 per share after the electric-car maker posted first-quarter results. A 64% spike in vehicle production powered a record delivery total -- 25,051 vehicles -- as revenue hit $2.7 billion, up 135%. That was enough to edge past consensus estimates of $2.6 billion of sales. Automotive gross margin rose 3.4 percentage points to 27.4% of sales. Yet despite that boost, operating loss worsened to $258 million from $248 million a year ago.
Still, executives were happy with the progress Tesla has made in building out its charging and sales infrastructure ahead of its planned entry into the mass market later this year. ""Model 3 vehicle development is nearly complete as we approach the start of production,"" Tesla told shareholders in its quarterly letter.

The company is aiming to get production up to 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of 2017 before crossing 10,000 in 2018. Over the shorter term, Tesla still expects to deliver between 47,000 and 50,000 cars in the first half of 2017. Shareholders can count on plenty of volatility after that, though, given the wide range of production rate possibilities at the beginning of the Model 3 ramp-up.

Fitbit beats low expectations
Shares of Fitbit rose 12% after the wearables specialist announced quarterly results that exceeded expectations. To be sure, the headline figures weren't inspiring. Revenue dove 41% to $299 million as the company generated a $60 million loss compared to an $11 million gain a year ago. However, both the top- and bottom-line results came in better than management's guidance.
Looking deeper into the operations, Fitbit sold 3 million devices -- compared to 4.8 million a year ago -- even as average selling prices ticked down 4% to $96.45. Yet CEO James Park said the device numbers understate actual demand since the company is still working through excess product at retailers. ""Underlying consumer demand has been better than our reported results in North America as we work down channel inventory levels,"" he said in a press release, ""giving us increased confidence that we will enter the second half of 2017 with a relatively clean channel.""
Park and his executive team still see revenue of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in 2017, which they're calling a ""transition year"" for the business. The company reaffirmed guidance for cash outflow of as much as $100 million and a non-GAAP net loss of between $0.44 and $0.22 per share. After that, management is hoping that the company can capitalize on Fitbit's strong brand in the wearables space with a round of more successful product launches that will put the company onto a firmer growth path.

An economy is like an engine: Both need fuel to accelerate. An engine needs gasoline, while an economy needs credit.
But the Federal Reserve is reporting a rapid deceleration in the growth of bank loans, a principal source of credit, and thereby fuel for the economy.

Data source: Federal Reserve. Chart by author.

Total loans at commercial banks in 2015 and 2016 grew on a year-over-year basis each month by around 8%. But starting at the end of last year, the growth rate has steadily dropped. The latest reading showed that total loans at commercial banks expanded at a rate of only 4.1% in March.
However, Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, recently told analysts that he ""wouldn't overreact to the short term in the loan growth because there are so many things that affect it.""
It's hard to say for sure what's behind this trend, but it's generally assumed that uncertainty around President Trump's pro-growth agenda could be causing businesses to wait before applying for new loans until the White House puts some legislative wins on the scoreboard.

Familiar household brands often make great long-term investments. Strong positive name recognition often brings stable cash flows, serious dividend yields, and staying power for the long run.
But how do you pick the right big-brand stocks to buy at any particular moment in time? We asked three of The Motley Fool's top contributors for their best ideas in this (admittedly broad) category right now. Read on to see why they picked Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), and Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP).

Seize this entertaining opportunity
Steve Symington (Disney): Given that shares of Disney fell 2.2% on Wednesday, it's clear the market was unimpressed with the entertainment conglomerate's first-quarter 2016 report. But that's not to say Disney's results were bad. 
Quarterly revenue climbed a modest 2.9% year over year to $13.34 billion, and adjusted net income per share climbed a solid 10.3%, to $1.50. Within that, top-line growth was primarily held back by declines in Disney's studio entertainment and consumer products/interactive media segments. 
But that's more an issue of timing than anything else; though Disney  raked in a solid haul with the late-run ticket sales from Moana andRogue One: A Star Wars Story -- both of which debuted in Q4 -- and the first few weeks of the live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast that hit theaters in March, that film slate was up against a tough 2016 comparison. The first quarter of 2016 benefited from both an earlier March launch of Zootopia and the sustained momentum of the $2 billion-plus box office juggernaut that was Star Wars: The Force Awakens. 
We should keep in mind, however, that the coming quarters will reflect contributions from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 -- which has collected more than $450 million at the box office in its first five days -- as well as Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, which opens later this month; Pixar's Cars 3, coming next month, Thor: Ragnarok and Pixar's Coco, coming in November, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi, hitting theaters in December.
Meanwhile, Disney's parks and resorts unit had a stellar first quarter despite this year's calendar shift the Easter holiday out of Q1, with revenue climbing 9% year over year, to $4.3 billion, and operating income jumping 20% to $750 million. For this outperformance, Disney can thank both last year's June opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, as well as increased attendance and guest spending at its stateside parks. 
To be fair, Disney also suffered a 3% decline in operating income from its cable networks -- despite segment revenue growth of 2.7% (to $4.06 billion) -- as continued subscriber declines and higher programming costs at ESPN more than offset higher income from both the Disney Channels and Freeform. This weakness renewed concerns over cord-cutting and Disney's ability to successfully navigate its cable business through today's changing media landscape.
But if one thing is clear, it's that Disney is well positioned to weather that change thanks to its various moving parts. And I think the stock should reward investors who decide to take advantage of this near-term pullback.
Molson Coors won't slow you down
Anders Bylund (Molson Coors): Beer-brewing giant Molson Coors shares are in the bargain bin these days. The stock price has fallen 5% year to date, in contrast to the 7% surge of the market-tracking S&P 500 index.
Some investors and analysts fear that Molson Coors and its sector peers face a growing competitive threat from legalized marijuana. In a recent earnings call, head of international operations Stewart Glendinning acknowledged that legal cannabis might divert spending away from the beer and liquor industries. At the same time, Glendinning noted that deployment and distribution of cannabis simply cannot measure up to the long-established infrastructure that's at the heart of Molson Coors' operations.
According to a recent study of retail sales data by analyst firm Cowen, both premium and standard beers have suffered low single-digit-percentage sales declines in markets where recreational cannabis use has been legalized. That's a challenge, but it's hardly the end of the world.
Meanwhile, Molson Coors can be bought for just 10 times trailing earnings. The company and its historical predecessors have survived world wars, Prohibition, and the rise of smartphones. Despite a plethora of alternative beverages and distractions, Molson Coors has found ways to stay relevant.
The cannabis challenge is no different. If you pick up Molson Coors on the cheap right now, you should be able to sit back and watch the brewer continue to flourish for decades to come.

A cheap retailer with a lot to prove
Tim Green (Bed Bath & Beyond): Retailer Bed Bath & Beyond has a well-known brand, if only due to the endless stream of 20%-off coupons that have for years found their way into our mailboxes. Those coupons, a strong tool for driving store traffic at a time when e-commerce is upending retail, have been both a blessing and a curse. Bed Bath & Beyond's sales have held up better than most; the company even managed to grow comparable sales by 0.4% during the fourth quarter. But margins have been declining for years.

BBBY data by YCharts
Slumping profits are the reason shares of Bed Bath & Beyond have tumbled since the start of 2015. The stock is down around 53% from its peak in that year, with investors increasingly questioning whether the company can successfully adapt to the age of e-commerce. Operating margin peaked in 2011 at 16.5%; it fell to just 9.3% in 2016, and there's no sign of this trend letting up.
Bed Bath & Beyond expects EPS to decline by as much as 10% in 2017, even after share buybacks. Clearly, investors need to tread carefully. But with the stock trading for less than 9 times the average analyst estimate for earnings this year, it could soar if the company manages to stabilize the bottom line. The company should also benefit from the folding of weaker retailers, although online competitors will continue to make life difficult.
Bed Bath & Beyond may never again achieve the kind of profitability it managed in 2011. But if the company can stop the bleeding and halt its multi-year profit decline, the stock could be in for quite the rebound.
",3 Big-Brand Stocks for May
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/09/why-proto-labs-stock-popped-13-in-april.aspx,2017-05-09,"
What happened
Shares of Proto Labs (NYSE:PRLB) soared 13.5% in April, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The quick-turn manufacturing service provider's stock is up 19% for the year through May 8. For context, the S&P 500 returned 1% in April and has returned 7.9% so far this year.
The 3D printing stocks are the best peer group we have for Proto Labs, though this group is far from ideal for comparison purposes, since 3D printing comprises just a small portion of Proto Labs' business -- it accounted for about 11% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2017. That said, shares of the two leading diversified 3D printing companies, Stratasys and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), gained 20.8% and 5.8%, respectively, in April, and are up 64.7% and 42.6% in 2017. It's obvious that the investor enthusiasm that began creeping back into the 3D printing space in 2016 is still alive and well in 2017.

Data by YCharts.
So what
There's no doubt about what drove Proto Labs' stock up in April: the release of its first-quarter 2017 earnings. The stock soared to a closing gain of 8.1% on April 27 after the earnings report. Moreover, likely reflecting investor optimism, the stock was up solidly in the two trading days that preceded the earnings release, for a total three-day gain of 14.3%. 
Indeed, there were reasons for investors' enthusiasm. In the first quarter, Proto Labs' year-over-year revenue grew 10.5% and its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 16%. Both results were significantly better than Wall Street analysts were expecting. CEO Vicki Holt, on the earnings call, attributed the good results to an improved economic environment and the initial success of the company's new sales initiatives. Moreover, Proto Labs remains profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles basis, with GAAP EPS rising 15%. 
Investors were obviously also at least satisfied, if not pleased, with Proto Labs' second-quarter guidance. The company expects year-over-year revenue to increase 6% to 14%, adjusting for discontinued operations and the impact from foreign currency, and adjusted EPS to grow 0% to 11.8%. 

Image source: Proto Labs.

For some context, 3D Systems reported last week that its first-quarter revenue grew just 2.5%, with organic revenue growing in the ballpark of 1.5%. While its adjusted EPS did increase a solid 20%, this dynamic won't continue for long, as a company needs revenue growth to fuel earnings growth over the long term. Moreover, 3D Systems remains unprofitable from a GAAP standpoint. (Stratasys has not yet reported its Q1 results.)

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-29778');
            });
        

Now what
The reason behind Proto Labs stock's robust performance last month is quite material to an investing thesis. So while one quarter is just one quarter, investors waiting on the sidelines might consider pulling the ""buy"" trigger if the company continues posting solid results for the next quarter or two.
As for 3D Systems, there were some reasons in its report for investors to be optimistic -- notably, its healthcare revenue jumped 29% year over year -- but those who are interested in gaining exposure to the 3D printing space by investing in a company that is currently GAAP profitable should pass 3D Systems by and consider Proto Labs.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/10/why-att-could-offer-retirees-sustainable-income.aspx,2017-05-10,"
Though there are other contenders for the title, AT&T (NYSE:T) may be the best dividend stock on the market today. The telecom giant offers a rare and powerful mix of current yield, long-term dividend growth, and an increasingly strong competitive position within its core markets.
Let's explore what makes AT&T a great pick for retirees seeking continuous income.
An income powerhouse with few rivals
Just examining AT&T's dividend stats makes quite the impression.
For starters, AT&T stock currently yields 5% -- which is more than double the current 1.9% yield of the S&P 500 -- better still, the company's actual average yield over the past five years is a slightly higher 5.1%. AT&T has increased its dividends per share annually for the past 32 years, earning it the vaunted title of dividend aristocrat. It has already increased its quarterly dividend by 2% from $0.48 to $0.49 at the beginning of the year. 
That may not seem like much of an increase, and indeed, if there is a weak point regarding AT&T's dividend prowess, it lies here. From 2007 through 2016, the company increased its quarterly dividend per share from $0.35 per share to $0.48 each quarter, which equates to an average annual growth rate of just 3.2%. The flips side is that the current yield is already quite generous.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-54751');
            });
        


Moreover, AT&T's balance sheet and interest coverage ratios seem safe. Last year, AT&T generated $24.3 billion in operating income, which easily allowed it to service its $4.9 billion in interest expense. The company did, though, pay out approximately 70% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends, which is a bit high. However, given the company's growth outlook, AT&T should be able to fuel further dividend increases by expanding its free cash flow, thanks to some savvy recent moves on the part of its management.

AT&T keeps getting better
Recent business activities also support the thesis that AT&T will continue to excel as an income investment. Here, the company's forthcoming acquisition of content giant Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) looms large.
Aside from the massive sticker price -- the 50-50 cash-and-stock transaction will cost AT&T a whopping $85.4 billion -- the deal also helps align AT&T's business with the likely direction of the telecom industry in the coming years. Specifically, this deal should allow AT&T to become one of the first names in the telecom or media industry to package wireless bundles with broadcast cable content, which would see the company playing both offense and defense.
In a world of ever-increasing media-consumption options, content has proved to be a valuable asset. Just think of the number of companies that have been rumored to be working on, or have already launched, video content of some kind, especially among tech companies. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Sony,Twitter, and Netflix are just a few names to spring to mind. This trend also coincides with ambitions from many of the same tech companies to launch telecom-esque services -- think Google Fiber. In this sense, owning Time Warner's content will increase AT&T's moat and make it hard for tech companies to challenge it for its wireless and broadband subscribers. That's the defensive part of the deal.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-12485');
            });
        


Buying Time Warner will also position AT&T to go on the offensive against other telecom and cable distributors. As I've mentioned before, this deal will allow AT&T to pair cable packages with its various wireless and telecom bundles. At a point when only Comcast appears to be headed in a similar direction, taking pole position in the movement to stream cable channels directly to smartphones and tablets should create a powerful incentive to steal consumers away from Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile.
Putting all of this together, we see that AT&T shares provide income investors with one of the most potent combinations of current yield and long-term dividend growth. Better still, the future looks increasingly bright for the company, thanks in large part to its Time Warner deal. Combined, these factors are what make AT&T a winning option for retirees seeking the best dividend stocks to own on the market today.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/09/is-altria-group-running-out-of-steam-or-taking-a-b.aspx,2017-05-09,"
Altia (NYSE:MO) has been a market laggard this year, with its 5% year-to-date gain trailing the S&P 500's 7% growth. It was also left behind by its overseas counterpart Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), which rallied 23% during that period.
That weakness might cause investors to wonder if Altria -- which more than doubled in value over the past five years -- has peaked. Let's discuss the bearish and bullish cases to see if the stock is running out of steam or merely taking a breather.

Image source: Pixabay.

Why Altria might be out of steam...
Altria generates all of its cigarette sales from the U.S. -- a market where adult smoking rates have consistently declined for over five decades. To offset those declining shipments, Altria raises prices. But states have also consistently hiked their excise taxes, making a pack of cigarettes much more expensive for the American smoker.
If we look at Altria's year-over-year growth in cigarette shipments and its total revenue, we'll notice that the company can usually squeeze out top line gains with its price hikes.

This business model has held up well over the past few decades, but the price of cigarettes in high-tax states like Illinois and New York are already well above $10 per pack. If other states follow their lead as smoking rates keep falling, Altria will need to invest more heavily in its smaller wine, e-cigarette, and smokeless tobacco units to continue growing.
Looking ahead, British American Tobacco's (NYSEMKT:BTI) planned takeover of Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) could put a lot of pressure on Altria with its superior scale and pricing power -- leading to market share losses for Altria's flagship Marlboro brand. Meanwhile, rising interest rates could convince income investors to dump big dividend stocks like Altria in favor of bonds with comparable yields.
Why Altria might just be taking a breather...
If you've been watching Altria's valuation, you've noticed that its trailing P/E fell from about 25 at the end of 2016 to about 10 today -- which is much lower than the industry average of 16 for cigarette companies. That drop reflects the huge earnings boost it received from Anheuser-Busch InBev's (NYSE:BUD) recent merger with SABMiller, which Altria held a 27% stake in. 

Image source: Pixabay.

That's why its reported diluted earnings surged 173% to $7.28 per share in 2016, although its adjusted earnings (which exclude the SABMiller impact) rose just 8% to $3.03. That earnings boost was temporary, but the extra cash could give Altria more room to scale up to counter British American or expand more aggressively into non-cigarette markets. Altria also still owns a near-10% stake in the newly merged company, which could boost its bottom line growth.
Moreover, Altria's lower P/E could insulate it from an interest rate hike-fueled sell-off of blue chip dividend stocks, since it's likely that income stocks with higher valuations would be sold first. 
There's also a rumor that Philip Morris International, which was spun off of Altria in 2008, could buy out its domestic counterpart to directly counter British American's purchase of Reynolds American. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog suggests that the likelihood of that merger occurring is 70% -- so investors who sell Altria today might regret it in the near future.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-90123');
            });
        

The verdict: Altria is just taking a breather
Altria's year-to-date performance isn't impressive, but its valuation is reasonable, it's a likely buyout target, and analysts still expect its revenue and earnings to respectively grow 2% and 9% this year. 
Altria isn't a buy and hold ""forever"" stock, since it can't raise prices, cut costs, or repurchase shares ""forever"" to offset declining cigarette shipments. But that business model should still hold up well for the next few years, which should give the company plenty of time to evolve its business model and diversify into other adjacent markets.

Insulet (NASDAQ:PODD) reported first-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closed on Monday.
The drug delivery company, which is a leader in tubeless insulin pump technology with its Omnipod Insulin Management System, delivered revenue growth of 25% -- which exceeded its guidance -- while its loss per share narrowed slightly. The company also edged up the lower end of its revenue guidance range for full-year 2017. 
Insulet's stock has gained 39% for the one-year period through the regular trading session on Monday, versus the S&P 500's total return of 19%.

Results adjusted for discontinued operations exclude the loss in the first quarter of 2016 from the company's Neighborhood Diabetes supplies business, which it sold in that quarter.
Revenue exceeded the company's guidance of $96 million to $99 million. Insulet doesn't issue earnings guidance. For additional context -- though long-term investors shouldn't place too much weight on Wall Street's near-term estimates -- analysts were looking for a loss of $0.15 per share on revenue of $97.8 million. So Insulet's earnings fell a bit short of Wall Street's expectations, while its revenue beat the consensus.

What happened with Insulet in the quarter?

U.S. Omnipod's revenue jumped 18% year over year to $59.7 million.
International Omnipod's revenue soared 63% to $25.1 million.
Drug delivery's revenue grew 12% to $16.9 million. Growth in this business continued to be largely driven by Amgen's Neulasta Onpro kit, which includes Insulet's Omnipod tech. CEO Patrick Sullivan said on the earnings call that Amgen said sales of its Neulasta Onpro kit represented over 50% of the U.S. Neulasta doses at the end of the first quarter of 2017. 
Gross margin was 58.4%, up 420 basis points (4.2 percentage points) from the year-ago period, driven by improved manufacturing and operational execution. The company remains on track to achieve its long-term gross margin target of 65%, Sullivan said on the call. 
In February, the company purchased a facility in Acton, Massachusetts, that will be used to expand Omnipod manufacturing and capacity beginning in 2019. At the time of the purchase, Insulet said the facility will provide capacity for it to manufacture up to 70% more pods on a single line with up to 90% fewer workers as compared to the total of its four current manufacturing lines at its contract manufacturer, Flextronics, in China.

What management had to say
Here's what Sullivan had to say in the press release about Insulet's quarter:

Every area of our business showed strong momentum and outstanding performance in the first quarter. We continued to execute on our commercial and operational strategies and made great headway on our key initiatives, including our manufacturing and supply chain efforts. This operational progress is driving high product quality, which supports a strong and always improving customer experience. We are investing in innovation to ensure our significant product differentiation and strong business model continue to position Insulet for success in the diabetes and drug delivery markets. 

Looking ahead
Insulet had a solid quarter. The company edged up the lower end of its revenue guidance range for full-year 2017 and established second-quarter guidance as follows:

It can be tempting to try to time the market, and get out before the crashes and recessions, but there's a mountain of research that suggests it's much better for investors to fight that urge and stay invested.
In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann go over some of that research and explain why it's so important to stay invested for years at a time, and not try to miss bad days or months. Also, they talk about the best thing an investor can do for their returns, and how investors should feel about buying into a bull market like this, where so many companies look a bit overvalued compared to their average prices.

A full transcript follows the video.







This video was recorded on April 21, 2017.

Dylan Lewis: I think a couple things that underpin why it's better to stay invested, even with the unpredictability of the market. There's a ton of volatility out there. Since 1928 -- this is a stat that I love -- the S&P 500 has lost 20% or more in six years -- 1930, 1931, 1937, 1974, 2002, and 2008. Aside from Great Depression years, in the following year of each 20% drop, the market has roared back with 25% or more return. So, the good and bad tend to follow each other very closely. 
If you look at things on an individual basis, as well, JPMorgan puts out this guide to retirement every year, it's kind of an overview of asset allocation, different strategies, and they also looked at the impact of staying fully invested versus missing certain days in the market. Over 1996 to 2015, missing the 40 best days in the market takes your returns negative if you had been invested in the S&P 500, and six of the ten best days for the market during that period were within two weeks of the ten worst days. So, individually picking and looking at these individual indicators can be really difficult, and oftentimes the market tends to flip very quickly. Again, getting to timing, it's really difficult to nail that down.
David Kretzmann: Yeah. If you're hesitant to buy today, you have to figure out, what would make you a buyer of stocks? Would it be after a 10% drop? A 15% drop? A 30% drop? What are you waiting for to be a net buyer of stocks? And making that kind of timing decision is incredibly difficult. That's why you have great investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch who say, ""Do not do market timing, it's probably the worst thing you can do for your future returns as an investor."" Often, psychologically, when the market is down 8%, you might think, ""Oh, I'm just going to wait until it's down a little bit more, I'm going to wait for it to recover a little bit,"" and you get into these mind games where you're hurting your future returns, because making that timing decision of both when to buy and when to sell, it just raises the probability that you're going to mess up somewhere along the line. As you've outlined in a nice way, Dylan, the key is to be invested through the good and the bad times. I know later in the show, we'll talk about some different ways that you can invest in a way that you're still comfortable and you're sleeping well at night, which is what you should do.

But the best thing you can do as an investor, the main advantages you have, here at the Fool, we believe, first, in, investing in individual companies. So, you have to factor that in. You're not necessarily buying an index fund, or buying a whole collection of companies. You're focusing on individual businesses. As an individual investor, your main advantages are, you can try to find and invest in and hold the greatest businesses out there -- the Apples, the Alphabets, the Facebooks, the Amazons, those kinds of companies -- and then you can also hold for a really long time. On Wall Street, the average holding period for a stock is now less than six months. Back in 1960, it was over eight years. The average holding period for a stock today is weeks or months. But, as an individual investor, you can say, ""I'm just going to tune out that short-term noise. I want to invest in great businesses. I don't care about what's going to happen over the next year or two, I'm more interested in, what is Amazon or Facebook or Apple going to look like in 10 or 15 years, not what they're going to look like in the next year.""
So, as an investor, the best thing you can do is lengthen your holding period, or your time horizon. Our former Fool colleague Morgan Housel has done some incredible research on this, looking back at historical S&P 500 data going back to 1870. He found, if you had held a stock for one year, basically looking at every incremental one-year period going back to 1871, if you just held for one year, it's basically like flipping a coin. One year you will be up, one year you'll be down. It's flipping a coin, basically gambling, if you're just trying to predict where things are going to go where things are going to go over the next year. But if you lengthen that out to five years, 10 years, 20 years, the odds of you making money at the end of those longer holding periods increases each time. There's actually been no 20 year period that if you had bought and held the S&P 500 over 20 years where you lost money. That's after inflation. That includes the Great Depression, it includes the Great Recession. Really, the message there is, the No. 1 best thing you can do as an investor to guarantee higher returns is to lengthen your time horizon. 
Lewis: You talked about investing in individual companies. I think that's something that can get lost in the huge macro stories we see. Very often, will something that is a sweeping macro issue really impact a company like Facebook? The fundamentals that underlie the businesses that you're investing in probably aren't touched all that much by something like rising interest rates. Yes, it will at least be something that impacts of broad market, but they still have the user growth they have, they still have the base of advertisers that are happy to put stuff on their platform. So, you have to remember that you're investing in the individual business, and while it's scary that there might be some rumors circulating about cataclysmic stuff going on in the market, the fundamentals of that business are really what's underpinning your investment.
Kretzmann: Definitely. Within the Odyssey II portfolio in Supernova that I head up with a team of a few other Fools, I will admit that we are having a harder time finding glaring bargains with individual companies right now. Stocks are, for the most part, more expensive than they typically are. You get outside of your comfort level a little bit. But we're tasked every month with managing this real money portfolio, and we have to make a purchase every month. The approach we take there is just focusing on the individual businesses. We'll build up positions in companies over time. I think at a time like this, you want to build positions in companies that you'll be comfortable adding to if they go on sale 20%, if they go down 20% to 40%. So, maybe that's Amazon, maybe it's Alphabet. Whatever it is, companies that you feel pretty confident will be around over the next 10-15 years, companies that are generating strong cash flow, maybe they pay a dividend, maybe you start with a small position and then say, ""You know what? I would actually really be happy if I could buy this company for a 30% discount, because I don't care where it'll be in a year or two. I'm more interested in the next five to 10 years or more.""

Financial stocks saw some of the heaviest trading, and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) beat the broader market with a 0.8% increase. Gold prices dipped by over 1%, which helped send the bullish bet on the precious metal, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEMKT:GDX), down 1%.
As for individual stocks, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) both attracted heavy investor interest in the wake of their quarterly earnings reports.

Apple keeps growing
Apple shares held close to all-time highs after the tech giant announced that it had earned $11 billion in its fiscal second quarter, which translates into $2.10 per share of profit -- up 10.5% over the prior year. Revenue came in at $52.9 billion, or just above the middle of the guidance range that CEO Tim Cook and his team issued in January.
Gross margin was 38.9% of sales, also within the company's earlier forecast thanks to improving average selling prices in the iPhone business and booming results out of the services segment. ""We are proud to report a strong March quarter,"" Cook said in a press release, ""with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus.""

Apple had some good news for income investors, as the company hiked its dividend payout by 10.5% to $0.63 per share. It also increased its share repurchase authorization after returning $10 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks during the quarter. Apple's fiscal third-quarter forecast projects continued growth as revenue rises to between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion from the prior year's $42.4 billion. On the product front, investors can look forward to the annual developer's conference in June and a refreshed iPhone release announcement in the fall.

Groupon's international stumble
Shares of deals specialist Groupon fell 13% following the release of the company's first-quarter earnings. Revenue dipped 4% to $673.6 million, while consensus estimates were targeting $722 million. The key driver behind the slump was a choice by the executive team to increase profitability at the expense of revenue growth in the U.S. market. That geography shrank revenue by 5% but increased profit by 2%. ""We are increasingly focusing the business on initiatives that are intended to maximize gross profit,"" management explained in a press release. Those shifts, they said, ""had an unfavorable impact on North America revenue."" Groupon also stumbled in the international segment, which added no new users and experienced a 15% drop in gross profit. Overall, the company continued to operate in the red, generating a $24.4 million net loss.
Executives left their full-year profit forecast unchanged. However, they said that their goal of producing a turnaround in the international segment following their exiting of 11 more markets is proving harder to deliver. The rebound effort will likely take ""a few more quarters than expected,"" they explained in an investor presentation, and so gross profit might end up at the low end of the target range of between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion this year.

Not every stock investor is exclusively interested in growth. Plenty of long-term investors who have managed to squirrel away a tidy fortune for themselves are far more interested in capital preservation as opposed to capital appreciation.
If you count yourself in that enviable situation, then you should be on the hunt for stable businesses that pay out a dividend. Our team of Fools thinks you should check out Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD), Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), and Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW).

A low-risk consumer giant
Brian Feroldi (Church & Dwight): Arm & Hammer. XTRA. Oxi Clean. Orajel. Trojan. Vitafusion. What do all of these beloved household products have in common? They are all owned by Church & Dwight, a consumer products company that has been in business since 1846! 
One big benefit of selling personal care and household products is that consumer demand tends to be inelastic. That's a fancy way of saying that consumers don't stop buying baking powder or laundry detergent just because the economy slows down. When combined with the company's ability to consistently raise prices and introduce new products to the market, Church & Dwight's financials statements are about as reliable as they get.

CHD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
This financial stability translates into a few big shareholder benefits. For one, the stock's beta is only 0.38, which means it's far less volatile than the S&P 500 in general. In addition, the company can use its dependable profits to reward shareholders with a steadily rising dividend (which currently yields 1.5%) and healthy amounts of stock buybacks. 
The only knock against Church & Dwight is that the company regularly commands a premium valuation. That's certainly true today as shares are currently trading just south of 25 times forward earnings. While that might be a tad expensive for a mature business, I'm a firm believer that it is worthwhile to pay up for quality. If you agree, then I think it will be worth your while to give Church & Dwight a closer look.
A dividend stock to bet on
Travis Hoium (Las Vegas Sands): Investors wanting to successfully invest in dividend stocks need to look for companies that generate plenty of cash year after year to pay that dividend. And in 2017, a great place to look is the gaming industry, particularly Las Vegas Sands. The company has spent billions building out resorts in Las Vegas, Macau, and Singapore, and now it's time to cash in. 
In the last 12 months, Las Vegas Sands has generated $4.36 billion in EBITDA, a proxy for cash flow from a resort. The current dividend yield of 5% requires $2.32 billion in cash to continue to be paid out. That means the company can continue growing the dividend, pay down debt, or fund growth projects like its proposal to build a resort in Japan. 
The wonderful thing about Las Vegas Sands' business and its dividend is that it's protected from competition. Macau has only six concessionaires, and the government limits the number of casinos and gaming tables in the region. In Singapore, it's one of only two casino resorts, leading to a resort that generates around $1.5 billion in EBITDA annually. 
Las Vegas Sands not only has a great dividend with room for growth, it also has cash flows that will be protected for years, even decades to come. And that's a stock successful investors should love.

Colorful dividend returns
Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Sherwin-Williams): For income investors, few metrics scream success as loudly as a good track record of market-thumping payout growth. Paint specialist Sherwin-Williams has this feature well covered. The dividend aristocrat's payout has tripled over the past decade, reaching $3.36 per share last year compared to $1 per share in 2006. That equates to an impressive compound annual growth rate of 13%.
Yet despite those gains, the company still pays out less than a third of its profits as dividends. And that's just one reason income investors can expect hefty payment growth in the future. For another, consider Sherwin Williams' profit margin, which recently climbed into the double-digits for the first time. The company is having no trouble passing along price increases in its paint stores even as sales volumes bounce higher. Those successes, combined with cost cuts, powered an 8% earnings boost last year -- outpacing the 5% revenue expansion. 
Sherwin Williams might not make many income investors' radars given that its yield is trailing the broader market by a wide margin, at just 1% today. That's not due to management's holding back on payout boosts, though. In fact, the company's last hike was 25%. Those with a long-term outlook should consider building a stake in this paint giant to benefit from what could be many more similarly strong increases in the future.
",3 Dividend Stocks for Successful Investors
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/13/what-investors-missed-in-the-market-this-week.aspx,2017-05-13,"
The markets were a little shaky this week, in part because of President Donald Trump's tweet storm and firing of FBI Director James Comey. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both tumbled 0.35% and 0.53%, respectively, for the week, although both continue to trade near record highs. 
With that said, there were plenty of stocks making big moves or big headlines as earnings season winds down. Here are highlights from a CEO on the hot seat, a gaming stock on fire (in a good way) and a retailer shaking things up.

Image source: Getty Images.

On the hot seat
Whether it's sports or stocks, coaches or CEOs, nobody likes to be on the hot seat. However, for both Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) investors and CEO Mark Fields, his seat is heating up. A few days before Ford's annual meeting of shareholders on May 11, it was reported that the automaker's board of directors was applying pressure on Fields about his strategy to improve profits faster and how best to light a fire under a stagnant share price.
""This is the first public sign that the board is becoming impatient,"" said David Whiston, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., according to Automotive News. ""It's likely proof that the board is frustrated with the stock price languishing for the past several years. It may be a grilling session for Mark."" 
It's easy to share frustration with the stock price, and despite a bumpy first quarter, the company has generated record level profits in recent years, but rather than sending its stock price soaring, it merely sent its valuation multiples lower. Fields is in between a rock and a hard spot, because the company's long-term future can't afford to ignore the evolution of autonomous vehicles, smart mobility projects, and the electrification of vehicle fleets. Those cost a lot of money to develop now, and the payoff is far down the road. Adding to the tense mood surrounding Ford, the board of directors, and investors, was news that Chantel Lenard, executive director of U.S. marketing and a 25-year Ford employee, will leave in June to ""pursue other interests,"" according to Ford.
There's no great answer for the folks at the Blue Oval, or Fields for that matter, because the market is what it is. It rewards Tesla, which is burning through cash at a record rate and selling a handful of vehicles compared to Ford, yet with a market capitalization larger than Ford's. Fields' seat is growing hotter, but let's be honest: Who would better serve Ford in the CEO position right now?
This game is far from over
Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) is an intriguing stock if it can capitalize not only on its games but also on the emerging trend of e-sports, which is a form of competition on electronic systems and video games. Even though e-sports just recently emerged onto the mainstream stage, rather than being limited to a niche of serious gamers, EA's stock has been absolutely soaring on the backs of its number of games -- its stock price is up a staggering 650% over the past five years. And if the company's recent fiscal fourth quarter is any indication, which pushed the stock 15% higher on Wednesday, this game is far from over. 
Revenue was up 16.7% during the fourth quarter to $1.53 billion, which was better than analysts' estimates calling for $1.49 billion. And don't let the company's net income percentage decline fool you -- it was down 37% to $566 million -- because that was largely an issue with an income-tax credit during last year's quarter. That $566 million net income equated to $1.81 per share, which was far ahead of the $1.63 analysts had expected.
In all, this was a brilliant year from EA, as it generated record net sales and operating cash flow for the year, driven by groundbreaking games and its continued improvement in the digital and mobile world of games. Here's part of a quote from CFO Blake Jorgensen that caught my eye: ""Our long-term vision, to leverage deep player engagement to drive growth and profitability, is enabling us to execute on our near-term financial goals to increase revenue, earnings, and cash generation."" 
To me, deep player engagement goes hand-in-hand with the spreading and increasingly popular e-sports niche, which fills tournaments with professional and dedicated players. With the stock's 650% increase over the past five years, investors could be cautious about jumping in now, but this could still be the early innings of a long-term winner.

            });
        

Are the good times gone?
Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM) was a massive success story for investors between 2009 and 2014, but since then it's been tough sledding and a growth story stuck in neutral. Investors were left even more confused after a week that delivered second-quarter results as well as an announced switch-up with its board of directors and chief financial officer.
As far as financial information goes, Whole Foods delivered roughly in line with analysts' estimates. Revenue checked in at $3.74 billion, just above estimates, and its earnings per share checked in at $0.37, matching the analysts. On the downside, its comparable-store sales declined 2.8%, and the board-of-directors shake-up overshadowed much of the earnings release. 
More specifically, five new independent members were nominated to replace the same amount of retiring directors. The moves come after activist investor Jana Partners, which owns a 9% stake in Whole Foods, applied pressure in hopes management would focus on operational improvements and look to sell the company.
With all the drama going on, it's easy to lose sight of what matters: Management simply needs to focus on returning to positive comparable-store sales and earnings by the end of its next fiscal year. If it can do that, many of its issues will solve themselves.  
",What Investors Missed in the Market This Week
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/28/should-you-buy-in-a-bull-market.aspx,2017-04-28,"
The market has been growing for years now, and by a lot of estimates, it's a bit overvalued today.
In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann discuss a listener question on whether or not it's wise for investors to wait for a correction before buying in. Find out how overvalued the market is today, how often markets correct historically, a few reasons some analysts are still counting on a bull market to continue well into the future, and more.

A full transcript follows the video.







This video was recorded on April 21, 2017.

Dylan Lewis: ""The stock market seems to be highly overvalued. From what I last read, the long-term average of the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 has been about 15, and now it's over 26. Would now still be a good time to invest during this bull market, or would it be better to sit on some cash and wait for a while and hopefully see that market correction and invest then?"" I love this question, and, broadly, I love getting listener questions. If someone out there is thinking something, chances are there are dozens or hundreds of Fools all thinking the same thing. Hunter, thanks for writing in. If other people have questions, industryfocus@fool.com. Let's jump right into it, David. He's talking about market timing. I think this is something that's on a lot of people's minds. If you consume financial news at some point over the last year, you've probably seen something along the lines of, ""The market is due for a huge correction,"" right?
David Kretzmann: You're probably been hearing that since 2009, since the Great Recession. It is a common fear, especially when you've had a multiyear bull market, and you have stocks hitting fresh highs on what seems like a pretty regular basis. We haven't had many 10% sell-offs over the past seven years. It's a good question, and it's something to keep in mind as an investor. On average, the stock market declines about 10% every 11 months, or about every year. Then, you'll have a bigger 20%, 30% or more decline every three to five-plus years. As an investor, you want to expect the market to go down. That's just part of the price you pay as an investor to get historically above-average returns with the stock market. But, I'll take a contrarian point here, since we will be talking about some of the potentially bearish indicators. Going forward right now, the market looks historically a little pricey when you look at the P/E ratio of 26. As you mentioned, the historic ratio tends to fall a little closer to 15 or 16 or 17. The forward P/E ratio of the S&P 500 right now is 18. That means, based on what analysts are expecting, the S&P 500 is expected to earn over the next year, right now the market is priced at 18 times those forward earnings. That shows that expectations are pretty high that growth will continue for the companies in the index. That's one angle. On a forward basis, if these companies can continue to grow, maybe they can grow into the valuation, and you don't necessarily need a big sell-off to revert back to those historical averages. That's one angle.
A couple other things we're actually going to talk about on Motley Fool Money today as well, on our radio show, the housing market is still below its historical averages. The housing market has slowly but surely been recovering since the Great Recession. But housing starts, which basically means the construction of new homes, is still below the long-term averages going back to 1960. As millennials now, people between the age of 18 and 34 in the U.S., they're now the largest demographic in the U.S. ahead of baby boomers. As people our age, Dylan, start to get closer to 30, they're thinking, ""Maybe I don't want to rent a house anymore, I want to buy a house or even build a house,"" that does a lot to spur growth within the economy, because there's so much that goes into the purchase and the upgrade on the renovation of a house. That's something that can drive economic growth and spending over the long term. Just a couple things there. Yes, on the surface level, the market does look pricier than normal. But there are some factors that make me think, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to have a huge crash right away. That's not to say that's not going to happen. As I mentioned before, you want to be prepared as an investor for some sort of sell-off down the road.

Lewis: I think, to add to that, you look back over the last year and a half or so, and the market has navigated what I would say are two major shocks to the system, one of them being Brexit, and the other one being the election of Donald Trump. Two big surprises that the market really wasn't anticipating. And yet, it has weathered it and continued to grow at this really great rate.
",Should You Buy in a Bull Market?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/09/3-beaten-up-driverless-car-stocks-bargains.aspx,2017-05-09,"
The driverless car market is still just gearing up, and the companies pursuing it are betting on their transformative technologies for the long haul; it's estimated that autonomous vehicles will create a $77 billion market by 2035. But getting to that point will be difficult, and not every early mover will wind up a winner. 
Along the way, many of those ambitious companies -- even the ones that do eventually see significant profits from this emerging trend -- will have to contend with issues in the markets that got them this far. And those unrelated issues might give investors a chance to buy into the autonomous vehicle space at a bargain level. 
Case in point: Ford (NYSE:F), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), three companies that have underperformed the market over the past 12 months. These stocks are beaten up right now, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad bets in the driverless car sector.

Image source: Getty Images.

Ford
Ford intends to launch its own fully autonomous vehicles by 2021, and also plans to license its technologies out to other companies.
The company says it will have a total of 90 autonomous testing vehicles by the end of this year, and it recently paid $1 billion for a majority stake in artificial intelligence specialist Argo AI, which will help build out the software for Ford's driverless cars. Argo AI will continue to operate independently from Ford, but some of the automaker's engineers will work closely with it.

Ford stock has tumbled about 16% over the past year; its most recent dip came on news that the company's net income dropped 36% year over year in the first quarter of 2017.. 
The company is currently trading at a forward P/E of just 6.71, compared the auto industry average of 11. While it didn't have a stellar Q1, I think Ford's long-term prospects -- including its autonomous vehicle plans -- and its low P/E ratio make it a bargain right now. 
Qualcomm
The company is in the process of buying NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), which is the world's largest supplier of automotive processors, for $57 billion. NXP also has also been developing self-driving technology that it plans to launch in 2020, which will bring Level 4 automation (nearly fully autonomous) to vehicles.
Qualcomm says the deal will be significantly accretive to non-GAAP earnings, and generate $500 million of ""annualized run-rate cost synergies two years after the transaction closes."" It also asserts that the acquisition will expand the company's serviceable addressable markets by an impressive 40% (to $138 billion) in just three years.

However, Qualcomm's stock took a huge hit a few months ago on news that the Federal Trade Commission was charging the company with anticompetitive practices, and that Apple is suing the company over its patent licensing deals. 
Qualcomm is currently trading at just above 13 times is forward earnings, lower than the tech industry average of about 25. There's an expanding market for its processors in driverless-car systems, as well as for NXP's automotive semiconductor and driverless-car technologies, so between them, Qualcomm could easily become a powerhouse in the autonomous vehicle space.
But the company still has to close the deal with NXP, and then prove it can benefit from this massive market. Additionally, Qualcomm may continue to be plagued with legal troubles for a while.
Its potential in the driverless car space and its low P/E make the company look like a bargain right now, but investors should watch closely to see how its issues with regulators and large customers play out.

            });
        

Baidu
Baidu is China's dominant internet search company, but it has its fingers in a wide range of tech businesses, including driverless cars. It jumped into autonomous vehicle research pretty heavily back in 2015, and has tested cars with various levels of self-driving capabilities in China and the U.S. since then.
The company's driverless car focus is on developing software for automakers; its current goal is to bring full autonomy to vehicles by 2020. Baidu took another step toward that last month when it opened up some of its software to automakers for testing. The new initiative, called Apollo, will allow automakers to test Baidu's software in controlled environments for now, then bring it to simple urban environments later this year. 

The company recently reported that in the first quarter, its revenue grew by 6.8% and earnings per share were up 10.6%, both on a year-over-year basis. Its price-to-earnings ratio is in the neighborhood of 24, which is nearly identical with the tech industry average. But Baidu has failed to impress investors over the past year, and the company's share price growth has lagged far behind the S&P 500.
While I've been bullish on some aspects of Baidu's driverless-car plans in the past, I'm starting to get skeptical that the company will truly to able to benefit in a tangible way. I used to compare its efforts to those of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), but now that company has spun-out its driverless-car business out of Google into its own entity, called Waymo. I think that gives Alphabet's efforts a focus and independence -- and, ultimately, an ability to benefit -- that Baidu's lack. With the financial benefits Baidu could accrue from its driverless car efforts still so unclear, I can't consider it a good play on the space at the moment.

Financial stocks led all sectors with the heaviest trading, and the popular Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) trailed the broader market with a 0.1% drop. Gold prices ticked up and helped the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:NUGT) rise 1%.
As for individual stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Coach (NYSE:COH) attracted heavy investor interest following their respective quarterly earnings reports.

Advanced Micro Devices misses high expectations
Advanced Micro Devices stock plunged 24% after the chipmaker posted its fiscal first-quarter operating results. The headline numbers met expectations, with revenue rising to $984 million and non-GAAP loss improving to $0.04 per share compared to $0.12 per share a year ago. ""We achieved 18 percent year-over-year revenue growth driven by strong demand for our high performance Ryzen CPUs as well as graphics processors,"" CEO Lisa Su said in a press release. 
Looking deeper into the figures, gross profit margin rose 2 percentage points to 34% of sales thanks to help from the new tech released. On the other hand, research and development expenses surged higher and cash flow sank due to debt payments and increased inventory.

But what really had Wall Street analysts conflicted was the company's conservative guidance for upcoming quarters. AMD sees sales growth slowing to a 12% pace next quarter despite a range of new products on the market including fresh Ryzen processors and new high-end GPUs. For the full year, the company projected sales gains at roughly that same pace. Plus, profitability is only expected on a non-GAAP basis. Investors were expecting more from a stock that had risen over 240% in the year leading up to Tuesday's report.

Coach's rebound gains momentum
Coach shares jumped 11% following solid operating results out of the luxury apparel and accessory specialist. The company managed steady comparable-store sales gains of 3% despite a big increase in selling prices that happened as a result of management's decision to reduce Coach's exposure to department stores.

Thus, even though reported earnings declined, gross profitability jumped higher by 190 basis points to 70.9% of sales. Coach also cut expenses, which led to a 13% jump in operating income.
""Our solid performance this quarter was very much in line with our expectations and our strategic initiatives,"" CEO Victor Luis said in a press release. ""[D]espite our deliberate pullback in the North America wholesale channel and the impact of calendar shifts, we delivered earnings growth,"" he continued.
Luis and his team are gaining confidence in their turnaround plan and expect sales to rise in the low-single-digit range this year. Notably, that increase will come as operating margin improves to between 18.5% and 19% of sales -- up sharply from the prior year's 14.5% result.
Ultimately, these trends should produce double-digit growth in net income to over $500 million. That's far from the $1.03 billion the retailer was earning as recently as 2013, but it still marks a decent rebound from its annual profit low, set in 2015, of just $402 million.

Fellow Fools,
Sean Stannard-Stockton is the president and chief investment officer of California's Ensemble Capital, which manages about $500 million on behalf of high-net-worth households, private foundations, nonprofit endowments, and charitable trusts. In interviewing him, I found that while Sean's investing philosophy is similar to Inside Value's: He brings a fresh perspective and some new ideas we haven't heard from previous interviewees. (He also really understands the math behind returns on invested capital!) Below, we discuss reinvestment moats and capital-light compounders, owner-operators, the Kelly Criterion for position sizing, baseline decay rates, his thoughts on businesses including Mastercard, and much more.
--John Rotonti
John Rotonti: How do you define a high-quality business?
Sean Stannard-Stockton: The most important indicator of quality is the strength and sustainability of a company's moat. A moat is a set of competitive advantages that protect a company from competitors. The fact is that most businesses do not possess much of a moat, and so while they may experience good results  or even great results for periods of time  if their business prospects are compelling, they will attract aggressive competition.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-50211');
            });
        


High-quality companies, with significant and sustainable moats, are much more in control of their own destiny. While they will face unpredictable challenges, their moat protects them and provides them with the room to adjust to changing conditions and maintain long-term profitability.
A good example is Tiffany (NYSE:TIF), the jewelry company. This 150-year-old business controls an amazing brand in the form of their little blue box. Despite operating through huge recessions, periods of inept management and even world wars, the company has been able to thrive because the power of their brand gives them the staying power to recover from missteps. Competitors who might hope to steal their profits have found that Tiffany's brand is such a strong competitive advantage that it is extremely difficult to win Tiffany's customers away from them.
JR: How do you define a high-quality management team?
SSS: We look for two primary traits -- ""How focused is a management team on running the business to optimize long-term return on invested capital?"" and ""How focused is management on maximizing shareholder value?""



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-70266');
            });
        


The first trait is relatively rare, because many management teams primarily focus on growth. Growth is generally a good thing, but the value of a business is the amount of cash it can distribute to shareholders over time. Management teams that understand this focus just as much on maximizing profit margins and capital efficiency as they do growing the top line.
Return on invested capital isn't just an accounting metric. It is the key driver of how much cash a company can distribute to shareholders relative to its earnings. Companies that focus on growing accounting earnings, rather than distributable cash, will not maximize the value of the business. We believe that one of the most persistent areas of mispricing in the stock market is the fact that most investors link valuation (P/E ratios, for instance) to growth rates, rather than recognizing that it is both return on capital and growth that determines valuation. We want to be sure that we're invested with management teams that understand the importance of ROIC.
The second trait seems like it should be automatic; the whole point of a company is to operate in the financial interest of its shareholders. But many management teams actually have little financial incentive to maximize shareholder value and are instead rewarded based on short-term financial metrics that may be only tangentially related to maximizing shareholder value.
It is important to note that we want to partner with management teams who exhibit these traits over long time scales. Effective management teams recognize that it is not uncommon for the best course of action for maximizing long-term returns on capital [to also be] damaging to short-term results. But managing through this short-term pain for long-term gain is critical for success.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-19374');
            });
        


Similarly, in seeking to maximize shareholder value, the best management teams recognize that providing value to all stakeholders  shareholders, employees, customers, and the broader community  is a key element of maximizing long-term shareholder value.
JR: Can you please briefly explain the difference between a legacy moat, reinvestment moat, and a capital-light compounder moat?
SSS: Just because a company has a moat that prevents competitors from stealing their profits doesn't mean they have an opportunity to grow. Companies that have a protected business, but little opportunity to reinvest their earnings in growth, can be said to have a ""legacy moat."" So long as management recognizes their lack of growth opportunity and sends cash earnings back to shareholders, these businesses can be great investments. The ultimate ""legacy moat"" investment might be thought of as a Treasury bond. Its future cash payments to owners are known and secure, but there's no opportunity for the cash payments to be reinvested so as to increase par value and future cash distribution power. But even a ""no-growth"" Treasury bond is a wonderful investment if you pay a cheap enough price.
Companies that do have growth potential come in two flavors: ""reinvestment moats"" and ""capital-light compounders."" Reinvestment moat companies have the opportunity to reinvest earnings in the form of capital expenditures or working capital to fuel growth. A good example would be a retailer that needs to build new stores and buy inventory to increase revenue and earnings. These companies can be great investments, but during their growth period, they will have little in the way of excess cash to distribute to shareholders. Indeed, distributing cash would be a poor choice by management if they can reinvest all of their earnings at high returns on capital.
Our favorite type of company is a moat protected ""capital-light compounder."" This type of company has a growth opportunity, but there is little need to reinvest their earnings to fuel that growth. Service-based businesses often exhibit this characteristic because they sell an intangible service and have limited needs for tangible capital to run their business. These companies grow not by retaining earnings on their balance sheet, but by adding more customers to a business model platform that doesn't need to be invested in to sustain a larger customer base. These businesses produce significant excess cash even while they grow. This is attractive because it means they can return cash to shareholders as well as grow, and because the cash production provides protection against financial issues during recessions.
While the concept of a moat has been articulated by many investors and originates in the writings of Warren Buffett, we'd point to our friend Connor Leonard of Investors Management Corporation for best articulating the concepts underpinning these different types of moats.
JR: Please explain how you narrow down your investable universe and how large that universe is.
SSS: Our investable universe is all U.S.-listed companies with a market cap in excess of our equity assets under management (currently about $450 million). Because we run a concentrated portfolio of 15 to 25 companies, we generally would not invest in a company with a market cap less than our AUM, because doing so would require us to own a large enough portion of the business that liquidity would become an issue and we would feel a need to actively engage with the board, which is something we have not done historically.
However, while this investable universe is very large, we only invest in companies that pass our rigorous requirements that they have a strong and sustainable moat, have a management team focused on generating strong returns on invested capital and maximizing shareholder value, and operate an understandable and forecastable business.
While these requirements are not complicated, they eliminate the large majority of companies. One way to estimate the percentage of companies that we might deem investable after completing our full due diligence process is to note that Morningstar, the only sell-side research organization that rates companies based on their moat, assigns their ""wide moat"" rating to just 10% of the over 1,500 companies they cover.
JR: Your portfolio is stocked full of owner-operated companies, which is a key criterion that our co-founder and CEO, Tom Gardner, looks for in his search for multi-baggers. Is high inside ownership by the founder and/or CEO a key factor that you look for when researching businesses and stocks?
Interestingly, while about half our portfolio might be deemed to be run by an owner-operator, depending on how you define that term, vs. only about 10% of the companies in the S&P 500, we do not actively target these companies. Instead, we target companies that have the attributes described above, and it just so happens that many of those are run by owner-operators.
We think this is due to the highly aligned financial incentives between owner-operators and shareholders, which makes building a moaty business, optimizing returns on capital, and maximizing shareholder value the only rational choice for an owner-operator to pursue. But we also think it is more than just these management teams having ""skin in the game,"" it is also what [value investor and fund manager] Sanjay Bakshi has referred to as having ""soul in the game."" Owner-operators generally built their business from the ground up and have devoted their entire lives to their company. They aren't motivated so much by earning more money  indeed, they are by definition already financially independent  but by the fact that their mission in life is to nurture and perfect their company. These sorts of managers often build corporate cultures where employees across the organization understand that these are their true goals, not simply hitting some financial metric.
JR: Are there any industries you tend to prefer? Or avoid?
SSS: We don't categorically avoid any industries, but some industries do not give rise to the sorts of companies we are seeking. For instance, commodity-based businesses do not typically exhibit strong moats, and some businesses, such as large banks and early stage biotech companies, do not typically have understandable (to us) and forecastable business models. But Warren Buffett's recent investments in the airlines industry highlight how previously uninvestable industries can undergo changes that may make them interesting in a way they were not in the past.
JR: How do you approach valuation?
SSS: We think that for the sort of companies we target, the only reasonable way to think about valuation is as the present value of future distributable cash flow. As shareholders, this is really the only claim you have that makes your shares valuable.
Of course, discounted cash-flow analysis is sensitive to a range of factors that allow people to abuse this tool to generate whatever fair value they have in mind. At Ensemble, we have a disciplined framework for generating these inputs that protects us from backing into the valuation we want and instead keeps us focused on the true intrinsic value of a business.
But at the end of the day, our valuation process results in an implied P/E ratio, which provides us with a sanity check. If the implied P/E ratio doesn't make sense to us, we'll stress-test our valuation model to understand what assumptions are driving the unexpected output.
In general, because our portfolio is full of ""capital-light compounders"" that can distribute cash to shareholders even while they grow, the fair-value P/E ratio of our holdings is higher than the P/E ratio of the market as a whole, since the market is made up primarily of companies with mediocre returns on invested capital and average growth potential.
JR: For those companies that are generating high returns on invested capital (ROIC), do you look for a minimum growth rate of revenue and earnings or free cash flow per share?
SSS: As my example earlier about a Treasury bond being the ultimate example of a ""legacy moat"" business suggests, even no-growth businesses can theoretically be attractive at the right price. But in practice, most of our portfolio are companies that we believe can grow revenue and earnings at rates higher than nominal GDP. These companies are taking share of the overall economic wallet and thus by definition are seeing an increasing relevance of their offerings. This is an attribute we like to see, but it is not a requirement.
JR: Do you have a preferred measure for the returns a business is generating?
SSS: We care about incremental returns on tangible invested capital. This is the metric that reveals how high of a return the company is earning on each new dollar they are investing in their business. Of course, businesses that can sustainably carry low-cost debt will report even higher returns on equity, which increases the value of the company. But returns on invested capital are the raw fuel that allows debt to be used to enhance returns on equity.
JR: Do you have a particular measure of cash flow that you prefer when analyzing most businesses?
SSS: We focus on long-term distributable cash flow. This is the cash a company generates in excess of any amount they need to reinvest to grow their business. This cash can be returned to shareholders via dividends or buybacks, or can be deployed opportunistically for value-enhancing M&A.
JR: How long do you typically research a business that you are not familiar with before you have enough information and conviction to decide whether you want to add shares to your portfolio?
SSS: Our process typically takes about a month or so of dedicated research by one of our analysts. The output is a written initiation report that articulates an assessment of the key areas I discussed earlier, provides an overview of the business, and includes a 10-year historical and five-year forward financial model that reconfigures the financial statements to conform with the way we look at business models.
If the investment team agrees that the company meets our criteria and the valuation is attractive, we will initiate a position at half the size we would expect to take over time. Then, during the next six to 12 months, as we get to know the business better, we will make a determination of whether our conviction has risen to a level where we will take a full-size position, or if that doesn't happen, we'll exit the stock.
We take these smaller initial positions simply due to our awareness that no matter how much due diligence you do, once you own a stock, you learn a whole lot more as your mind becomes attuned to noticing relevant information. This dynamic is familiar to anyone who has been pregnant or whose spouse has been pregnant, when all of a sudden you notice pregnant women everywhere. Or to someone who has bought a new car, and starts noticing the same make and model everywhere they go. The human mind is able to focus only by being blind to much of the world. But once your mind decides to focus on a new type of data, you'll be amazed how often you start seeing things that are relevant.
My favorite example of this phenomenon is this video that demonstrates visibly just how shockingly blind we all are to information we are not actively looking for.
JR: How important is it to invest in companies that can grow predictably and profitably in this low-growth world?
SSS: The whole reason to identify companies with moats is because these companies have a protected business model that gives us confidence in projecting what their longer-term financial results will look like. We don't believe that we, or any investor, can predict future financial results exactly, but companies with moats give us reason to believe we can make judgements about a reasonable range of outcomes.
However, ""predictable"" doesn't necessarily mean that results should be stable over short time periods. While all else equal, we would rather a company produce stable and growing earnings, we are comfortable investing in cyclical business models, as long as that cyclicality is a form of volatility around a longer-term stable trend.
In the market today, we believe that the stocks of many non-cyclical businesses are overvalued, and investors too often conflate low-volatility financial results with quality business models. Our portfolio is currently made up of a greater mix of economically sensitive companies than we've held historically, because we've found that these companies are currently more likely to be undervalued. A large portion of our portfolio is currently in the technology, industrial, and consumer discretionary sectors, and while we don't seek to make investment decisions based on sector exposure, we note that these three sectors are currently trading very close to their long-term average valuation levels, while less cyclical sectors such as consumer staples and utilities are trading near the very high end of their historical valuation ranges.
JR: Do you have any performance metrics that you prefer management compensation be based on?
SSS: We love to see performance tied to return on capital-type metrics such as ROIC, ROA, ROE, etc. For capital-light compounders where little capital needs to be deployed, performance tied to profitability can often achieve the same effect. At the end of the day, we want executive compensation tied to the degree that management drives up the intrinsic value of a company and/or returns capital to shareholders.
However, we believe that Total Shareholder Return (stock appreciation plus dividends) is often not a good metric unless it is measured over long time frames, as management should not be incentivized to try to prop up the stock price in the short term.
JR: How do you try to avoid big losses that could interrupt the compounding of your portfolio?
SSS: First of all, every company we invest in has a moat, and our hope is that when we are wrong on valuation, we will end up recovering at least some of our investment by the company successfully increasing its intrinsic value over time. In these instances, we may underperform, but not see a permanent impairment to capital.
After limiting our investments to high-quality moats with sustainable competitive advantages, we believe our framework for position sizing is our most important tool for controlling risk. Position sizing is one of the most underappreciated aspects of investing. Everyone on CNBC will tell you what stock they think you should buy, but no one ever says how much to buy!
Our position sizing framework is built on the insight of John Kelly, whose collaboration with Ed Thorp resulted in the Kelly Criterion. The Kelly Criterion shows that it isn't just the amount of potential upside an investment has that should influence position size, but the degree of likelihood of a successful outcome.
The logic of this is easy to see. No one would bet their life savings on a coin flip, even if being correct meant winning 10x. The 50% chance of losing everything means that this very attractive proposition should only be taken with a relatively small amount of your wealth. Whereas a bet that paid you 2x, but promised a 99% chance of winning would quite reasonably justify putting down a much larger stake.
In our portfolio, we rank our holdings based on our level of conviction in a successful outcome on the one hand, and on the degree of expected upside on the other. At any given level of potential upside, we'll take a larger position in a company that we have more conviction in. This framework results in taking positions at cost in the 1% to 7% range. After accounting for appreciation, we don't let any position size get to over 9% of the portfolio. Our practice of taking half-sized positions at initiation is essentially a way for us to recognize that our conviction is more limited until we've spent more time learning about a company as actual shareholders.
In addition to limiting the amount to which appreciation can inflate a position size, we are also cognizant of the risk that adding more and more money to a stock that keeps declining can present. So to guard against being stubbornly wrong on a stock -- avoiding ""value traps,"" as they are often referred to -- we cap the amount of total capital we will invest in a stock at the same percent that we cap a position size based on appreciation. So if we buy a 5% position, and believe it should be capped at 7% if it appreciates, we will similarly stop investing more capital into the position if, after successively buying more as it declines, our capital investment at cost reaches 7%.
JR: When do you sell? Will you hold a high-quality company that is fairly valued?
SSS: A key element of our valuation process is that our forecasts of future revenue growth and returns on capital are bounded by historical baseline decay rates seen by public companies. Using research by McKinsey, we estimate the rate at which revenue growth will slow and return on invested capital will decline over time. We use this data as a base rate in making forecasts, and then use company-specific analysis to shift our estimates away from these base rates.
This ""base rate"" forecasting methodology comes from the esoteric-sounding field of Bayesian statistics. But political forecaster Nate Silver offered an excellent layperson explanation of this process in his book The Signal & The Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail -- But Some Don't, and it is discussed in the book Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction by Philip Tetlock. The fact that most equity analysts ignore base rates and instead make forecasts based only on their company-specific analysis is the reason why equity analysts as a group systematically overestimate growth rates. You can see this illustrated by looking at the way that total revenue and EPS growth rates for the S&P 500 systematically start the year off at excessively optimistic levels and decline over the course of the year.
What this approach means is that our fair values are based on the company in question experiencing competitive pressure on their results that is similar to the average company. Since we seek out companies with strong competitive advantages, we hope these base rates and the resulting valuation are conservative.
Therefore, we are willing to hold stocks that have appreciated to a level that we believe is fairly valued, unless we have better use for the sales proceeds (i.e., a more undervalued stock that we do not have a full position in). But if a stock appreciates to 10% to 20% above our conservatively calculated fair value, we'll exit the position and go to cash if needed. This isn't unlike the behavior of the companies we invest [in]. Very few management teams of great companies would sell out for fair value. Instead, they would require a premium bid to sell. As shareholders, we feel the exact same way.
JR: What common characteristics or patterns do you recognize in some of your biggest winners?
SSS: Our biggest winners over the last five to eight years, such as Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL), and Broadridge Financial (NYSE:BR), all exhibit a similar pattern. We bought them at a discount to fair value based on our conservative outlook for their results at the time, and then actual financial results significantly exceeded our expectations, leading to the intrinsic value growing quickly, such that even after very large increases in the share price, we still believe these securities are undervalued.
This is a big reason why we favor capital-light compounders or reinvestment moats over legacy moats. A legacy moat business can be bought cheaply, but without the ability to reinvest capital at high rates, the intrinsic value of the business isn't going to appreciate very much. Whereas a capital-light compounder like Mastercard, which has grown earnings at a mid-teens rate even while paying a dividend and buying back significant amounts of stock, has seen its price appreciate by almost 700% since 2010, even while being, in our judgement, significantly undervalued the entire time.
JR: What lessons did you learn or patterns do you recognize from some of your losers?
SSS: Unfortunately, one mistake we've made a number of times is buying into a company whose financial results were inflated by an unsustainable tailwind that we did not recognize at the time. Our investment in National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) in 2010 is a good example. We believe that the major decline in the rig counts since oil prices crashed is a cyclical event, and rig counts will continue to rebound back toward previous highs. But we underestimated the extent to which purchases of ultra-deepwater rigs, which produces far more revenue for National Oilwell Varco per rig than a shale oil rig, were inflating National Oilwell's new orders when we first purchased the stock.
Since we typically don't try to time industry cycles, and instead focus on identifying normalized levels of demand, this mistake isn't so much related to the cycle turning faster or slower than we expect, but rather us not recognizing a driver of current results that is unsustainable.
Charlie Munger has discussed how he and Warren Buffett made this type of error when they bought COIT, a furniture rental company, during the dot-com boom. What they didn't realize at the time was that dot-com companies were greatly increasing the demand for renting office furniture, and so while COIT seemed nothing like a speculative tech stock, in fact the company's financial results were being unsustainably inflated by the bubble in technology stocks.
JR: According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, Tiffany has generated an average ROIC of 13% and grown revenue at a 2% CAGR over the past five years. Would you rather see Tiffany boost growth or boost returns?
SSS: Increasing growth and increasing returns on capital both enhance the value of a company, because both actions result in the production of more long-term distributable cash flow. An interesting mathematical fact is that companies with high returns on capital can increase their intrinsic value the most by increasing their growth rate, while high-growth companies should focus on increasing returns on capital.
If you imagine a grid with growth on the x axis and ROIC on the y axis, companies should seek to drive the business toward the upper right quadrant. If they are in the lower left, they should direct their attention equally toward increasing growth and ROIC. Those in the upper left should seek to grow faster while those in the lower right should seek to increase returns on capital.
JR: What are your thoughts on current stock market valuations?
SSS: We spend very little time thinking about market level valuations. If you own 20 companies, you focus your attention on the valuation of those stocks and don't worry too much about where all the rest of the stocks in the market are trading.
But as a generalization, we think the market is within the relatively wide range of what we would consider fairly valued. Given [that] the trailing P/E ratio of the market is above average, the current valuation suggests that earnings growth over the medium term will be faster than normal, or that interest rates will stay permanently low. In the latter case, low rates make it reasonable for investors to accept a lower rate of return on equities. A high valuation does not imply a coming fall in stock prices; it simply implies that future long-term returns will be lower than historical returns.
Both of these outcomes, which would support current market valuations, seem plausible to us, given the fact that the US economy is operating well below its historical level of trend growth, and so a cyclical reacceleration in the economy could be coming as the headwinds from the financial crisis recede. And while we think interest rates will move higher over time, we may be wrong in this outlook. Certainly, they have been persistently lower than we have expected them to be, and so it is not unreasonable to think we may be in for a very long period of low rates.
JR: Your Intrinsic Investing blog is one of my favorite resources on investing. What are some of your favorite things to read online?
SSS: Aside from The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, which together provide an excellent overview of what's going on in business and the world at large, we find the writing of other bloggers to be an excellent resource for exposing ourselves to new ideas, opposing points of view, and thoughtful, in-depth analysis of topics we care about.
Some of our favorite blogs include Abnormal Returns, Fundoo Professor, Market Folly, Philosophical Economics, Base Hit Investing, Punch Card Research, and the writings of Jason Zweig and Morgan Housel.

",Sean Stannard-Stockton: Lessons From Winners Like Mastercard and More
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/11/american-water-works-q1-earnings-jump-13-dividend.aspx,2017-05-11,"
American Water Works Co. (NYSE:AWK) released first-quarter 2017 earnings last week. The country's largest publicly traded water and wastewater utility's revenue increased 1.7% year over year, and its earnings per share jumped 13%. This represents a strong start to 2017, following a solid 2016. 
Shares of American Water have returned 5.7% in 2017 through Wednesday, somewhat lagging the S&P 500's 7.9% return. However, the stock is still a big winner over time periods longer than one year. For the three-year period, for instance, it's returned 75%, flowing by the broader market's 36% return.
Here's how the quarter worked out for American Water and its investors.

Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of $0.53 per share on revenue of $759.5 million, so American Water missed the EPS estimate by $0.01 and also slightly missed the revenue consensus. Both its results came in so close to analysts' expectations that many folks -- myself included -- would consider that the company essentially came in on target. 
EPS got a boost of $0.02 relative to the year-ago period thanks to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. Excluding this benefit, EPS would have increased 8.7% -- still a very solid result for a water utility.

Year-over-year EPS for the core regulated business was up $0.04 per share, driven by higher approved revenue and surcharges to support the infrastructure investments the company made, acquisitions, and organic growth, and slightly offset by lower water demand. The regulated business invested approximately $242 million in the quarter on upgrading infrastructure. 
EPS for the market-based business increased $0.01 driven by slight earnings increases in the homeowner services group and Keystone Clearwater -- which provides water and related services to energy producers in the Appalachian Basin region -- partially offset by lower capital upgrade work in the military services group, which completed a major project at Fort Polk in Louisiana in mid-2016.

Acquisitions in 2017

Image source: Getty Images.

In the first quarter, American Water closed on two acquisitions (Shorelands Water Company in New Jersey and the much smaller Meadowbrook Water Company in California) that, combined, brought it about 12,700 new customers. It also has three acquisitions pending (the wastewater facility of McKeesport in Pennsylvania and two much smaller utilities, one in Illinois and one in California) that, combined, will increase its customer count by about 33,000. It also added about 3,700 new customers in the quarter thanks to organic growth in its existing business. 
Acquisitions are a key part of American Water's earnings growth strategy. The company's goal is to grow EPS by an average of 7% to 10% per year through 2021, of which 1% to 2% of this is targeted to come from regulated acquisitions. (Infrastructure improvements supported by rate hikes in the regulated business are slated to add 4% to 6% EPS growth per year, with plans for the market-based business to kick in approximately 2% EPS growth per year.) 
Dividend increase of 10.7%
In last quarter's earnings report, American Water's management said it foresaw a 2017 dividend hike at the high end of its long-term EPS growth target of 7% to 10%. The company delivered -- and then some -- as it announced that it is raising its dividend by 10.7%. The dividend is payable on June 1 to shareholders of record on May 5.

            });
        

Efficiency keeps flowing in the right direction
American Water's key operation and maintenance (O&M) efficiency ratio for the one-year period through Q1 was 34.6%, which is a 1 percentage point improvement from its 35.6% for the one-year period ended in Q1 2016. This ratio reflects how well the company is controlling costs in its regulated business -- the lower the ratio, the better.
The water utility has been steadily improving this ratio, as it was above 44% in 2010. Its goal is to hit 32.5% by 2021.
Looking ahead
American Water turned in another good quarter. The company reaffirmed its previously released earnings guidance for 2017: It expects EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.08. This guidance represents projected EPS growth of 4.9% to 8.5%.
As a reminder, American Water's goal is to grow EPS by a compounded average annual rate of 7% to 10% per year through 2020 (from the base year of 2015). The company's early progress on achieving this goal has been good, so there's every reason for investors to expect continued robust growth going forward.

When great business leaders speak, investors listen. The attendance at last week's Berkshire annual meeting was evidence of that.  But with Berkshire now so big that Warren Buffett lamented the amount of cash they have lying around, perhaps it's time to for investors to look at smaller companies with a similar business philosophy.
One such company is Markel (NYSE:MKL), also known as ""Baby Berkshire Hathaway."" Like Berkshire Hathaway, Markel is an insurance company, offering a variety of personal and commercial lines in the U.S. (55%), internationally (23%), as well as reinsurance (22%). The company uses its insurance float to invest in stocks, bonds, and private companies, which it calls Markel Ventures. Its annual report from February revealed several similarities.

Profitable even in brutal conditions
 Markel reported insurance markets have been ""soft,"" meaning extremely competitive, since the mid-2000s, citing only 2012 as a rebound year for pricing.  .
Despite these challenges, Markel has grown gross premiums from $2.2 billion in 2008 (pre-crisis) to $4.8 billion last year. More remarkably, the company kept its combined ratio below 100% every single year of that stretch except 2011, when it was 102%. A combined ratio measures the costs of the insurance underwriting, so a ratio below 100 indicates profitable underwriting, before investment income is taken into account. That kind of profitable growth in a competitive environment is commendable and mirrors Berkshire's similar conservatism. 
Investing like Buffett
On the investing side, Markel's CIO Tom Gaynor has also excelled, with the 5-year return on its equity portfolio of 15.9%, versus 12.2% for the S&P 500 (with dividends reinvested), and a 10-year return of 8% versus a return of 7.51% for the S&P (with dividends reinvested) over that time.  This is at a time when most active managers are finding it very difficult to beat passive index funds. Like Berkshire, Markel has an excellent investor to head that department. 




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-31311');
            });
        

Thinking long term
Markel points to its long-term mindset as an advantage that enables it to produce these returns. In its report, Markel states, ""We think about your company in two distinct yet completely connected time horizons, namely, forever and right now."" 
This long-term mindset gives Markel a competitive advantage by not having to chase quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year performance, which can backfire if one writes unprofitable insurance business.
You can see the long-term mindset in the annual report itself, as the company chooses to break out investing performance and book value growth in five-year rolling increments. That means the company thinks of five years as the shortest time frame upon which to grade its performance.
Like Berkshire, the company does not chase growth on a quarterly basis, but invests in safe assets that will appreciate over the long term. As Buffett once said, ""our favorite holding period is forever.""  
But technology is making capitalism more brutal
At the same time, management realizes that focusing on the long-term is not the same thing as being complacent. The company writes,

We won't sugar coat it. Business, (and life) these days, resembles an all-out, full sprint, winner-take-all race, to adapt to the changes wrought by technology. We must continuously learn, and adapt to new conditions, adopt new technological tools, abandon obsolete business practices and systems, find new markets, develop new products, acquire new businesses, and succeed at every other challenge you can think of to continue to build Markel... The emphasis on right now means we need to make appropriate changes and adapt to this way of doing business right now! There is no time for cherishing old ways and reminiscing about an idyllic past. 

Like Berkshire Hathaway's recent investments in IBM and Apple, which mark a break from Buffett's traditional investing philosophy,  Markel management realizes it must adapt to technological change.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-12517');
            });
        

Management uses quotes from non-investors
As Buffett always likes to quote actors, comedians, writers, and athletes in his annual letters to make his points, so does Markel. 
In the 2016 annual letter, Markel did not disappoint, citing quotes from none other than Bruce Springsteen and former Packers football coach Vince Lombardi to illustrate the selfless culture it tries to nurture.
Bruce Springsteen: ""Rock and roll bands that last have to come to one basic human realization. It is: the guy standing next to you is more important than you think he is. And that man or woman must come to the same realization about the man or woman standing next to him or her, about you. Or everyone must be broke, living far beyond their means and in need of hard currency. Or: both."" 
Vince Lombardi: ""Individual commitment to a group effort-that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.""
For those wishing to invest in a Berkshire-like company that isn't so big, at 1/30th the size, Markel may be worth a look. 


",5 Things to Know About Markel from Its Annual Letter
http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/05/12/3-retirement-moves-to-make-in-your-40s.aspx,2017-05-12,"
Your 40s are an interesting time of life from a financial perspective. On the one hand, you're probably past the point of paying off your student loans, and you're not yet dealing with the astounding cost of college tuition. On the other hand, 40-somethings still have a host of expenses to deal with, from mortgage payments to summer camp to everyday costs that magically manage to increase over time.
If you're in your 40s, you may be so focused on your immediate expenses that you've yet to put much thought into retirement. After all, it's still a good 20 years away -- or more. But your 40s are actually the perfect time to get a handle on retirement, and with that in mind, here are a few moves to focus on.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. Ramp up your savings
Chances are, you're earning more in your 40s than you did in your 30s -- in which case it pays to stick as much of that money as possible into a retirement account. The beauty of IRAs and 401(k)s is that they offer tax-deferred growth on your investments, which means that instead of paying taxes on your gains year after year, you can reinvest them and grow your nest egg significantly.
Not only that, but funding a traditional IRA or 401(k) will give you an immediate tax break, which will probably come in handy if your salary has increased. A $5,000 contribution to either account, for example, will shave $1,250 off your tax bill if your effective tax rate is 25%.
But crucial as those tax benefits are, the real reason to save aggressively for retirement in your 40s is that you still have time to take advantage of compounding. Say you're able to save $5,000 a year starting at age 45, with the goal of retiring at 65. If your investments generate an average annual 8% return (which is just below the stock market's historical average), you'll be sitting on an extra $229,000 by the time you're ready to leave the workforce.
On the other hand, if you wait until age 55 to start saving that same $5,000 a year, you'll have just $72,000 for retirement, which is only a third of what you would've accumulated by starting in your mid-40s. The more time you give your money to grow, the more you'll benefit from compounding and tax-deferred earnings, so now's the time to focus on increasing your contributions.
2. Reduce your debt
It's one thing to carry mortgage debt in your 40s, but credit card debt is a different story. Yet a large number of 40-somethings are drowning in credit card debt. In fact, consumers in their mid-40s to mid-50s have the highest levels of credit card debt than any other age group. Not only that, but the typical borrower in that range is lugging around a balance of over $9,000. Ouch.
If you're carrying a hefty credit card balance, it's time to start chipping away at that debt as soon as possible, with the goal of eliminating it completely by the time you reach your 50s. Why the deadline? First of all, the sooner you knock out that debt, the less interest you'll pay. Furthermore, by the time you reach your 50s, you're likely to face one new major expense -- college. Freeing up cash by the time your kids' tuition bills come due can help you and your children avoid loads of student debt.
Another good reason to pay off credit card debt in your 40s is that by the time your 50s roll around, you should really be focusing on eliminating another source of debt -- your mortgage. The less debt you carry into retirement, the less financially stressed you'll be once you start living off a fixed income, so it pays to tackle your debt step-by-step, starting with credit card debt in your 40s.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-14575');
            });
        

3. Review your investment fees
A frightening number of adults who do save for retirement with an IRA or 401(k) have no idea how much money they're losing to fees. If you've been neglecting your retirement plan, now's the time to review your investments and make sure you're not giving up more money than necessary.
As a general rule, you'll typically pay more for actively managed mutual funds than you will for index funds. That's because index funds are passively managed; they simply seek to match the performance of existing indexes, such as the S&P 500.
Not only do index funds have lower expense ratios, but they tend to deliver better returns than their actively managed counterparts. In fact, a recent Morningstar study found that between 2004 and 2014, index funds performed better than actively managed funds on a whole. Before you spend the next 20 years throwing money away on fees, take the time to explore some lower-cost options for your portfolio.
With retirement just two decades away, your 40s are the perfect time to boost your savings, get out of debt, and eliminate fees that could eat away at your long-term returns. While it may be too soon to start counting down to retirement, focusing on it now can set the stage for a financially secure future.
",3 Retirement Moves to Make in Your 40s
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/05/why-puma-biotechnology-trex-and-national-cinemedia.aspx,2017-05-05,"
The stock market performed reasonably well on Friday, sending major benchmarks to gains of 0.25% to 0.5% on the day. Favorable news from the U.S. economy outweighed any concerns about geopolitical events occurring this weekend, including the much-awaited final phase of the French elections. The Dow regained the 21,000 level, and the S&P 500 finished just below the 2,400 mark. But some stocks missed out on the rally, and Puma Biotechnology (NASDAQ:PBYI), Trex (NYSE:TREX), and National CineMedia (NASDAQ:NCMI) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Puma sees a key departure
Shares of Puma Biotechnology fell 16% after the biotech company said in an SEC filing that an executive in charge of regulatory affairs and project management would resign from the company effective May 15. The filing said that Dr. Robert Charnas had told Puma last week about his departure, with the filing citing health reasons for the move. Yet investors seem to be nervous about the timing, coming immediately before a key advisory panel meeting for its neratinib treatment for breast cancer. Given that neratinib has seen patients in trials report negative side effects, some investors believe that Puma might have trouble getting a positive recommendation from the panel when it meets later this month. The stock's decline might prove to be an overreaction, but the company's decision to put the information in a filing rather than doing a full press release might have contributed to investors' skepticism about the move.

Trex falls despite solid growth
Trex stock declined 9% in the wake of the company releasing its first-quarter financial results. The home deck and railing specialist said that sales climbed 10% from year-ago figures, with increasing margins helping to produce an 18% rise in net income. Trex has gotten a lot of accolades from its industry, including kudos for its environmentally friendly practices and its leadership role in promoting alternatives to traditional wood decking and railing materials. Yet guidance for sales of $160 million in the second quarter only matched investor expectations, and despite calls for improving market share and margin figures, Trex investors seemed to want more from the decking specialist as the high spring season for home improvement begins.

            });
        

National CineMedia plays a horror show
Finally, shares of National CineMedia lost more than a quarter of their value. The in-theater media company said that revenue was down 6% from the year-ago quarter, leading to a drop in operating income and a wider net loss compared to the first quarter of 2016. Despite gains in sales from its local and regional segment as well as its digital and beverage businesses, softness in national advertising revenue weighed on the company's overall results. CEO Andy England reiterated that he sees 2017 as ""a transitional year for NCM as we evolve from being the largest cinema network into a truly progressive, integrated digital media company."" That means investors have to expect tough results this year, and National CineMedia's guidance called for revenue to fall 1% to 6% and produce a 6% to 12% drop in adjusted operating income. As movie theaters struggle to get people to leave their homes for entertainment, National CineMedia will have to work harder to find new avenues for growth.

Today, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger fielded several hours of questions from Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) shareholders at the company's annual meeting.
As always, the topics were as varied as the answers were colorful. Here are five highlights investors should know. 
1. How will Berkshire spend its $96.5 billion cash hoard?
In Berkshire's first-quarter earnings report, which was released the day before the meeting, the company revealed a cash stockpile of $96.5 billion. And unlike many companies with massive stockpiles of cash, Berkshire's is mostly stashed in the U.S., meaning it could easily be put to work.

Image Source: The Motley Fool.

Now, Buffett likes to keep at least $20 billion in cash on the balance sheet at all times at an absolute minimum, but that still leaves massive potential for acquisitions and/or stock investments. Munger even said that Berkshire could potentially do a $150 billion deal tomorrow, if it was willing to take on some debt and/or sell some stocks.
Unfortunately, good opportunities are getting more difficult to find. In reference to Berkshire's acquisition of Precision Castparts, Munger pointed out that ""this is no screaming bargain like the old days,"" and Buffett agreed, saying that compelling bargains are tough to find -- hence the stockpile of cash.
So, what would prompt Berkshire to start putting its cash to work? Essentially, Buffett said that Berkshire wants to acquire businesses that will have a competitive advantage over the next five to 10 years, whose management teams are strong, and that are offered at a fair price. For more color, Buffett has actually laid out Berkshire's acquisition criteria in some of his annual letters to shareholders, and you can read about them here.
Buffett also said that if there's a persistent shortage of attractive investment opportunities, Berkshire may eventually choose to increase its buyback criteria of 120% of book value or less, but he is still optimistic about finding ways to deploy Berkshire's capital.
2. What would lower business tax rates mean to Berkshire and its shareholders?
Tax reform has been a major news item since President Donald Trump took office, with a particular focus on the prospect of lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%. During the Q&A, Buffett was asked how this would affect Berkshire -- specifically, how much of the benefit would be realized by the customers of Berkshire's businesses, and how much of the benefit would go to shareholders.
Buffett said that any change in how Berkshire's investment gains are taxed would directly benefit shareholders, while some of the savings for businesses would likely be passed on to customers, with the amounts differing by business.
More importantly than what the Trump tax plan would mean to Berkshire is that Buffett is confident that Berkshire would do well in any economic climate, pointing out that Berkshire has dealt with extremely high corporate tax rates in the past -- and has thrived.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-2597');
            });
        

3. Buffett is still a big fan of index funds for most people
For most investors, Warren Buffett says that a simple S&P 500 index fund is the best investment that they can make. He's been especially vocal about this in recent years, particularly as an alternative to utilizing active investment managers.
In fact, Buffett has advised his own wife to invest in index funds after his death, as opposed to Berkshire shares.
When asked why this was, Buffett said, ""It's the best investment for people looking for the least amount of worry."" Previously, Buffett has referred to an investment in an S&P 500 index fund as a bet on American business, which is almost certain to do well over long periods of time.
Buffett is such a fan of low-cost index funds that he said that ""Jack Bogle [the founder of index fund pioneer Vanguard] has probably done more for the American investor than any man in the country.""
4. Airlines and railroads are two very different businesses
Berkshire surprised many investors with its investment in the four largest U.S. airlines, but there's one comparison Buffett wanted to address.
Specifically, many analysts have compared Buffett's airline investments to his railroad investments. And it makes sense -- before acquiring BNSF Railway in full, Buffett took smaller stakes in several major railroad companies. In fact, Munger recently said, ""It [the railroad industry] was a terrible business for 80 years...but they finally got down to four big railroads, and it was a better business. And something similar is happening in the airline business.""
However, when asked about the airline investments, Buffett rejected this logic, saying that there's no comparison between the two. Airlines simply don't have the competitive advantages of railroads. Railroads are a lower-cost option than other methods of transporting freight (such as trucks), and have lower operational expenses. Airlines, on the other hand, are in a highly competitive environment (although it's gotten better), and the fundamentals of the business aren't as attractive.
So why did Buffett buy the airlines after years of negativity? Essentially, he feels that after having gone through years of consolidation, the few major airlines that are left are positioned to grow revenue over the coming years. It has been operating for some time now at 80% or better of capacity  meaning available seat miles  and you can see what delivery is going to be,"" as Buffett puts it. In addition, all four airlines Berkshire owns have been producing strong returns on invested capital and have been buying back stock fairly aggressively, characteristics Buffett loves to see. 




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-35283');
            });
        

5. All businesses have problems
Not surprisingly, one of the first questions of the meeting was about Wells Fargo and the company's now infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal.
As he's done before, Buffett essentially responded that Wells Fargo is still a great company, but it made a serious mistake.
As we know now, Wells' incentive structure was the big problem. ""Clearly at Wells Fargo there was an incentive system built around cross-selling a number of services per customer,"" said Buffett. "" Well, it turned out that that was incentivizing the wrong kind of behavior. We've made similar mistakes.""
He also said that Wells' biggest mistake was lack of action on the part of then-CEO John Stumpf. ""It had to stop when the CEO learned about it...they totally underestimated the impact"" of the issue.
Later in the meeting, Buffett was asked a similar question about some of Berkshire's other investments, such as American Express and the loss of its Costco relationship, as well as United Continental and the widely publicized incident of a passenger being violently dragged off of a flight.
""We did not buy American Express or Wells Fargo or United Airlines or Coca-Cola with the idea that they would never have problems or they would never have competition. But we did buy them because we thought they had very, very strong hands.""
In other words, all businesses have problems, and as long as the problems are dealt with responsibly and Berkshire's long-term investing thesis still applies, Berkshire doesn't abandon its investments because of hiccups like these.
That's an important takeaway for all long-term investors as the businesses they own inevitably run into problems. If the thesis hasn't changed, headwinds may create even more buying opportunities for those with the right mindset.

On this episode of Market Foolery, Chris Hill welcomes Motley Fool analyst Bill Barker to the show to break down several quarterly reports, none of which managed to please investors.
There were only a few bright spots for Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) in a weak quarter, but venerable department store chain Macy's (NYSE:M) missed badly. Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM) managed to stay in line with expectations, while Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) first report as a public company did not paint a pretty picture. 
A full transcript follows the video.







This video was recorded on May 11, 2017.
Chris Hill: It's Thursday, May 11th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio today, from Motley Fool Funds, Bill Barker. Thanks for being here.
Bill Barker: Thanks for having me.
Hill: Thank you for braving the torrential downpour out there. It is torrential.
Barker: I was able to make it up from inside the office to inside the office without getting wet. What route do you take to get from the first floor to the fourth floor? Do you go outside? Are you Spider-Man?
Hill: You know what, I don't talk about that. I'm not supposed to talk about that. The other Avengers told me, they're like, ""Just keep it quiet.""
Barker: Just take the elevator, the elevator works. I know you have a fear of them, many people do. There's nothing to be ashamed of, but I'm telling you, it works and it keeps you dry.
Hill: Fair enough. We have a bunch of things to get to. There's a big shake up at Whole Foods. Oh, we're definitely going to talk about Snapchat's first quarterly report. But we're going to start with retail. Macy's and Kohl's both reporting first-quarter results. Macy's, wow did they miss big on profits and revenue, and their same-store sales were down more than 4.5%. Kohl's, a couple of bright spots with Kohl's. They're discounting less, this is something we saw last week with Coach. That's helping a little bit in the case of Kohl's, it's helping with customer traffic, which was a little higher, so that's good. But their comps were still down, their revenue was light, and both these stocks are down today, although Kohl's down about 5% to 6%, Macy's down 13% to 14%. Macy's is just having a brutal 2017.
Barker: Yeah, it's pretty fine, the differences between the two reports. Really, it has more to do with expectations and a comparison of Kohl's first quarter last year, which was really weak. So it was a relatively easy thing to improve upon. Macy's is shedding sales. You have 3% to 5% fewer same-store sales at your store, you're closing stores, and the margins are going down because they are still discounting. There's no good number, there is no good number in the Macy's report.
Hill: I mean, if a year from now, one of these companies was up for sale -- I can't believe I'm asking this -- is it Macy's? Because it wasn't all that long ago that Macy's was really doing pretty well in part because they managed their store footprint so well. Now, Macy's, in the S&P 500, only Signet Jewelers is having a worse 2017 than Macy's in terms of the stock performance. Macy's is 499th out of the S&P 500 in terms of year-to-date performance. Is Macy's more likely to be sold than Kohl's?
Barker: I suppose it might be, although I don't know why I should speculate on something I don't have any insight on, between two of those getting sold. I think they're both going to decrease their footprint, they're going to keep selling stores if they're smart. I think Macy's has slightly more debt, so I'd be a little bit more worried about that. Debt is very cheap right now, of course. You would prefer to be taking on debt and buying back shares. But if you're Macy's and you've already got a dividend of 5%, a yield of 5%, they're paying out a lot of the profits that they do have in the form of dividends. It's tough to cut the dividend. If you cut the dividend, you're going to see your stock price get hammered. So even though it's possible that somebody in management might think, ""We should buy back our shares because they're about the same price they were 20 years ago, why not take advantage of that,"" they can't, I don't think.
Hill: You just went in the direction of what was going to be my next question about the dividends. It does seem like, that's a move we've seen with other companies, but even in cases where a company has cut their dividend significantly, 50%, 75%, they suspend it, even in situations where companies have telegraphed that move, you always see the sell off. And I'm just wondering, in the case of Macy's, is that just going to be a bridge too far for many investors, particularly on the institutional side?
Barker: It's close to a last resort, I think, for the company. It's a known flag, that if you can't pay your dividend, there are big problems. I'm sure they wish their dividend was not as high as it is. Although, they can keep selling property. The most important thing for Macy's right now other than getting fashion right, which is constantly an issue for them, is to manage their real estate well, and by that, include making the right sales. They don't want to get into the position -- and, there are a lot of other sellers out there, between J.C. Penney, Sears, you have a lot of property coming on the market. You don't want to be throwing yours in there at the wrong time. So you need a fair amount of expertise as to where you can get value for your earnings. And that might help them keep paying the dividend. They're able to pay it with their current earnings, but the trend is pretty bad for where earnings are going, for Macy's and Kohl's. Kohl's is not particularly better off, it's just been following up on a slightly weaker last year, so they have slightly easier comps. But, their yield is also about 5%. Some investors might look at that and say, ""A 5% yield is pretty good, I'd like to get 5% on stock."" But this looks more like a value trap to me.
Hill: Let's move on to Whole Foods. Second quarter results were about as expected in terms of profit and revenue. The big story with Whole Foods is the shake up. And it's a pretty big one. Five new independent directors are going to be on the board. There's a new chair, Gabrielle Sulzberger, who comes from the world of private equity, a new CFO. I think all of these things taken together are what have shares of Whole Foods market up 1% to 2% today. John Mackey is on our board of directors here at the Motley Fool, we always point that up for purposes of disclosure. I'm a shareholder of this company. That there was a shake up --
Barker: Are you?
Hill: Yes. That there was a shake up was not necessarily a surprise to me. That it was this big did surprise me. Just when you think about the scope in terms of operations and a new chair. And I have to say, I'm happy about the fact that one of the new people on the board of directors is Ron Shaich from Panera Bread. I think any business that deals with selling food of any kind, if you have Ron Shaich on your board, your board just got better.
Barker: Yeah, he's impressive. I've seen him at conferences. He gives good conference. He also has done an outstanding job with Panera. To focus on him, I'll do that because I know his body of work better than the other new directors. He's just been involved in selling Panera to JB.
Hill: And he couldn't have looked happier.
Barker: And there's so many rumors out about who might be interested in buying Whole Foods. You have Jana, who has taken a stake and is agitating for big shake ups. They've shaken up the board, maybe not in the way that Jana is trying to dictate. But, that's playing a little bit of a defense. But they're also, by getting Shaich on, and somebody who has a private equity background, playing some offense as well, in terms of positioning themselves to react responsibly to all of these rumors of who might be interested in buying Whole Foods, including [Amazon.com], that's actually why the stock is as elevated as it is right now. You only have to go back a month and a half ago before that rumor came out, to find Whole Foods trading at about $30 a share, it's $36 today, it's a stronger performance today than the market generally but not up that much.
Hill: Let me get into the weeds a little bit here with Jana Partners. For those who don't know, Jana Partners, private equity firm, took a stake in Whole Foods. Part of the story of the shake up is people trying to figure out -- I think this is largely seen as, as you said, a responsible response to all of the legitimate business questions about Whole Foods Market. But it's also seen as, ""You know what's going to keep Jana Partners at bay at least for a little while? If we bring in not just a little fresh blood but a lot of fresh blood.""
Barker: Yeah. Going back to Shaich, I think, the Panera experience is a reasonably good overlap for Whole Foods. Panera has the advantage of moving toward more healthy ingredients in their food and having the time to do it, announcing, ""We're going to get rid of cage-fed proteins and also move toward getting out of antibiotics,"" and various things, and having time to do that, rather than starting from where Whole Foods is, at a sort of a purity. It's harder to get to the place where people want to go, which is buying Frosted Flakes, from the purity side, which is where Whole Foods is. So adding some of the things that people -- by ""people"", I mean mostly me -- would like to buy at Whole Foods and can't find there. And I think they're boxed in a little bit. Panera had the advantage of getting healthier at a time when people are gradually, or enough of them, are gradually improving their diets, rather than being in a spot where Whole Foods is, where taking steps to improve its selection in terms of the breadth of people who would like to shop there means that it's taking a step away from its core mission.
Hill: It would be nice, once in awhile -- at Costco, there's the whole surprise aspect, and I know this from Mac Greer, who loves to shop at Costco, and talks about, ""Oh, the treasure hunt, if you go there, there's always a surprise or two."" That would be nice, if every once in awhile you walked into Whole Foods and it's like, ""Look, Captain Crunch! It's on the shelf! I'm totally buying that just because it's here!""
Barker: They can have the guilty pleasures aisle. 
Hill: Absolutely.
Barker: Right? They could just say, ""Alright, this is bad for you. You know it, we know it. But come on, everyone has their guilty pleasures."" And that would be the most crowded aisle in the store.
Hill: When you go on a diet, I've heard, there's a cheat day. Yeah, that's like the cheat aisle, a guilty pleasures aisle, I like that.
Barker: You should be on the board. You're a shareholder. You have all these great ideas.
Hill: ""To counteract all the wisdom and experience of Ron Shaich, we brought in this dope."" You mentioned the 365 concept, and I'm curious where you think that goes.
Barker: I didn't mention that.
Hill: You did, briefly.
Barker: When? Last time I was on the show?
Hill: A couple years ago, the big story with Whole Foods was, ""OK, they're going to roll out these smaller-footprint 365 stores."" A year from now, where do you think that is? Is that completely shelved? Is that gone now that you have all these people? Because it kind of seems like it would be really easy to just put that whole notion aside. I don't think you bring in Ron Shaich and a new chair and all these other independent directors and just tell them, ""No, we just want you to nod and smile at the plans we've had in place for a couple years.""
Barker: Yeah, I think that Whole Foods is better off focusing on massive fine-tuning. The affinity program is getting the data on its customers through loyalty programs and that sort of thing. The thing that they're so far behind the competition, rather than taking on new ventures, they have their hands full. It's not that they've been making lots of mistakes so much as competition has appeared, it is well-financed, it knows how to do groceries, and it has seen Whole Foods turf and the profitability that's available if you do organic right. And everybody's getting in and giving them competition. So they have a lot to fend off, and are better off protecting what they have, rather than pursuing grand new ventures.
Hill: Snap, parent company of Snapchat, issued its first quarterly report as a public company, and frankly, it's hard to imagine it going much worse than it did. The loss was bigger than expected, the revenue fell short. The user growth was weaker than expected. Stop me if there's a silver lining out there. No one was expecting them to turn a profit. They're in growth mode. I get all of that. But this was pretty bad. And the conference call, which we'll get to in a second, only made it worse.
Barker: They are in growth mode, and I think that's worth ... OK, so year over year, what was their revenue increase? 12 months, 2016 to 2017 for the first quarter, percentage-wise, how much do you think they grew?
Hill: 20%?
Barker: Almost 4x. They're up 286%. So, when you say, ""I don't see how it could have been much worse,"" I would say, not everybody grows at 286% year over year. And it is true that that was not enough to match the market expectations, and they put in a lot of growth, spruced up their numbers, before going public a little bit less than a quarter ago. Daily active users didn't quite meet expectations, but still grew to 166 million from 122 million. So, that's 36% growth in daily active users. Only slowing down 5% over the last quarter. So, if you're looking for a silver lining, I would say this -- hyper growth is hard, hard to measure. And it is almost always wrong in one direction or another. They underperformed the hyper growth expectations. Market was pricing in better. After today's report, they're back down to a little bit, 10% above, where they IPO'd at.
Hill: Can we get to the conference call?
Barker: We can get to the conference call. It was challenging to come up with anything positive about it. They're growing, they're not growing profitably, and that's a big problem. A lot of investors are going to say, ""I don't really care about the growth. I want to see the profits growing, not just top-line growth."" And you're not doing that. And you paid yourself a lot in stock options last quarter. And there is a net loss of $2.2 billion, most of that was stock-based. But that's a real expense.
Hill: And one more thing people would be excited about on Wall Street is if the user number was growing at some exponential rate, to go from 158 million to 166 million, that's what we like to call tepid, in terms of quarter over quarter growth. It's perfectly reasonable to me that the stock is down more than 20% today. In addition to all of these numbers -- and, again, the quarterly report is backward looking, as it is for any public company -- but Evan Spiegel the CEO, gets on the conference call, doesn't really give any sort of specific guidance in terms of what they have in the pipeline, and tries to play it cool like, ""Oh, we want to continue to surprise people."" It's like, you know what? Surprises in the world of investing are great if it's a surprise on the upside. Surprising on the downside is never a welcome thing.
And the money quote from the conference call is when he was asked about Facebook, and was asked point-blank, ""Are you scared of Facebook? Why or why not?"" And he laughed and talked about, ""Well, we're a creative company, we're focused on creativity,"" and then took a shot at Facebook by saying, and I'm quoting here, ""Just because Yahoo has a search box, it doesn't mean they're Google."" Which I think bags the follow-up question, ""Did you just compare yourself to Google? And, by the way, did you just compare Facebook to Yahoo? Because neither of those things are even close."" And I think, it points to a big red flag that has been out there for a long time about Snap, which is Evan Spiegel. Does he have a Sheryl Sandberg in the way that Mark Zuckerberg does? Does he have a team? He's a creative guy, but I'm not sure he should be running this business. And three months from now, if they put up another quarter like this, then you really have to bang the drum for what we like to call adult supervision.
Barker: Yeah, that's possible. I imagine you will hear that if they don't produce better numbers, or numbers more in line with what people are expecting. Also, if he doesn't do a better job on the PR. Because this is not the kind of attention that he needs on challenging ... I mean, they're in a fight with Facebook.
Hill: They're absolutely in a fight with Facebook.
Barker: They're absolutely in a fight, so it probably doesn't actually change anything. They're not going to wake Facebook up. Facebook is quite awake and copying everything they do.
Hill: Right. Facebook was awake the second Mark Zuckerberg offered Evan Spiegel $3 billion in cash a few years ago, and Spiegel said no, and then Zuckerberg went to his team and said, ""Alright, build me something that's going to take them out.""
Barker: Yeah. So, right now, the market cap is about $21 billion for Snap, so I would say that was a good turndown of that offer.
Hill: At the moment.
Barker: At the moment. It may, if everything goes wrong -- actually, they have more than $3 billion on their balance sheet in cash, so it would take a lot of cash burn to end up being worth less than $3 billion. I don't foresee that. But they've got a very tough competitor, and they'd better be better at the game than Yahoo was, which seems like more of the right comparison for them, with Facebook being the Google.
Hill: A couple housekeeping notes before we wrap up. This weekend, on Motley Fool Money, our guest is going to be documentary filmmaker Steve James. You may remember a little film he did called Hoop Dreams.
Barker: I do remember that. You can't call that a little film. That may be the longest film I've ever seen.
Hill: Really? I mean, it's a long film.
Barker: It's a long film. I don't know. It's longer than Gone with the Wind, isn't it?
Hill: No it's not. 
Barker: No?
Hill: No, I don't think so. You go ahead and look that up. But, no. It's certainly one of the longest. I think the longest films I've seen, that, Gandhi, and The Right Stuff.
Barker: The Right Stuff isn't nearly as long.
Hill: All great movies, by the way.
Barker: How about Reds?
Hill: Never saw it. So yeah, Steve James, new documentary film out called Abacus.
Barker: 2 hrs and 50 minutes for Hoop Dreams. I thought it was longer.
Hill: Yeah, that's not Gone with the Wind. Last week on Market Foolery, Simon Erickson was on, one of the things we talked about was Motley Fool Explorer. I mentioned we'd share some more details about that. Here are the details. If you want more, you can go to explorerradio.fool.com. A bunch of investing videos that Simon and the team have put together that you can check out. And, last, on a personal note, in late June, I'm doing a family vacation in London and Ireland, going to Dublin, maybe Cork. So, if you have any advice, any tips, hit me up on Twitter, or please drop an email to marketfoolery@fool.com. I know you have London advice for me. We'll get to that after the show.
Barker: After the show?
Hill: Yeah. I need tips.
Barker: You need a lot of advice.
Hill: I need a lot of advice. All advice for London --
Barker: Secret Cinema.
Hill: -- and Dublin is welcome. Secret Cinema?
Barker: Secret Cinema, that's my vote.
Hill: Alright. We're going to wrap up and talk more about it.
Barker: And a little thing called Wimbledon will overlap with your time there.
Hill: Uh ... yeah ... If it were just me, if it were just me --
Barker: You played a little tennis back in your high school days.
Hill: I did, and if it were just me --
Barker: That was not the sport at which you were state champ, though, is it?
Hill: Yes it is.
Barker: It is? I thought basketball was your state champ.
Hill: Both. When I was a senior --
Barker: Check you out, two state championships?
Hill: Let me be very clear. On the tennis, that was like, yes, I was on the team, I was second doubles.
Barker: Maine is a big state.
Hill: Geographically, I suppose. There's not a ton of tennis teams. But as always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) beat the broader market with a 0.6% increase as bank stocks had a generally good day. A near-1% drop in gold prices, meanwhile, pushed the leveraged bullish bet on the precious metal, Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:JNUG), down almost 8%.
As for individual stocks, BroadSoft (NASDAQ:BSFT) and Ensign Group (NASDAQ:ENSG) made big moves following quarterly earnings reports.

BroadSoft lowers its outlook
Shares of Cloud communications specialist BroadSoft fell more than 8% after the company reported solid fiscal first-quarter earnings while downgrading its operating outlook. Revenue rose 9% during the latest reporting period to $79.9 million, which was in the middle of the forecast that management issued in late February. Non-GAAP earnings also met expectations at $0.19 per share.
""We were pleased with our solid first quarter results,"" CEO Michael Tessler said in a press release. ""We made meaningful progress against our 2017 strategic objectives during the quarter,"" Tessler added.
However, billings growth slowed to a 12% pace from nearly 20% in the prior quarter. And that shift likely played a role in management's lowered outlook for the year. In fact, Tessler and his team are seeing weaker demand in Broadcom's professional services and subscription and support offerings -- two segments that have been key to its growth lately. As a result, 2017 revenue is now expected to be between $380 million and $390 million compared to the prior forecast of $390 million to $400 million.
Executives left their earnings outlook unchanged and said they remain optimistic about BroadSoft's long-term opportunity. Yet Wall Street -- never happy to see a growth downgrade -- pushed the stock lower on Monday.

Ensign Group's pipeline of growth
Ensign Group, which runs a network of hospice and assisted living facilities, saw shares jump almost 7% after posting first-quarter results that showed improving operating metrics. Sales rose more than 15% to $441.7 million, edging past consensus estimates that were targeting $434 million. Adjusted earnings stopped at $17.9 million, translating into $0.34 per share, while Wall Street would have been happy with $0.33 per share.

Management credited accelerating revenue gains, especially in the nursing and managed care segments, for the surprising growth. ""We are very encouraged by the results our skilled nursing operators achieved during the quarter,"" CEO Christopher Christensen said in a press release.
The company is bullish about its near- and long-term outlook, given that it has a pipeline of 99 newly acquired and transitioning locations. While growing, these homes still have plenty of room to improve toward the company average in terms of occupancy. The transitioning nursing operations as a group are only 65.9% occupied, while the rest of the company's average stands at over 80%.
Ensign Group believes this new class will contribute to healthy earnings gains starting in the second half of this year. ""With many of the challenges from 2016 behind us,"" Christensen said, ""we expect our newly acquired operations ... to continue the momentum created during the quarter and that each will make a meaningful contribution to the bottom line in the latter half of 2017 and beyond.""

Earnings season is here, and companies across the board are reporting in.
In this week's episode of Industry Focus: Energy, Motley Fool energy analysts Sean O'Reilly and Taylor Muckerman dive into the most important takeaways from big players like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX); why so many oil companies are increasing or maintaining their dividend even while the industry struggles; how dividends and buybacks play into shareholder value; and more. Also, the hosts look at changes in the price of oil this week and what's behind them, new gas tax legislation that'll likely be coming out of South Carolina soon and what it will mean for the state, and more.



A full transcript follows the video.







This video was recorded on May 11, 2017.

Sean O'Reilly: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is Thursday, May 11th, 2017, so we're talking about energy, materials, and industrials. I'm your host, Sean O'Reilly, and joining me in studio is the man that brings a love of energy stocks as well as professional soccer to a whole new level. What's up, Mr. Muckerman?  Taylor Muckerman: Hey, buddy.  O'Reilly: How's it going?  Muckerman: It's not too bad.  O'Reilly: What's your favorite soccer bar in D.C.? I know you told me.  Muckerman: There's couple in Arlington. You have the old-school Summers. It was going to close down because rent was going to be jacked up so high --  O'Reilly: That's happens a lot around here.  Muckerman: So, they put the signs up one December ago, the year before this last December.  O'Reilly: What did the signs say, ""Our landlord is mean""?  Muckerman: ""Sorry, we're going to be closing, escalation of rent, blah blah."" But then the patrons caused such an uproar that the landlord didn't jack up the rent and left it open. It's been open since the '70s or '80s.  O'Reilly: I also live in Arlington, and I see it where, when rent gets jacked up, a restaurant leaves, and then it's vacant for a year. And I'm like, ""You could have bought a house with the rent that you missed out on here.""   Muckerman: I know. There's a lot of things going on in the Arlington restaurant scene that causes these places to go vacant. But, yeah, not Summers. They've built a faithful following.  O'Reilly: Yeah, you guys turned the ship. Good for you. Fight the power.  Muckerman: Benfica clenched the Portuguese League over the weekend. SLB, baby.  O'Reilly: [laughs] I'm so glad I said what I said, because it's so true. So, today, we're going to do the obligatory oil and gas earnings review, because it's what we do. We're going to dive briefly into gasoline taxes, which may or may not be going up depending on if you live in a certain state, stay tuned.  Muckerman: Or may have already gone up.  O'Reilly: Well, it's over six years. And, really quick, before all that, what is up with oil prices? Do you see what happened yesterday?  Muckerman: Had a good day yesterday.  O'Reilly: A little bit. We've had a rough couple of weeks.  Muckerman: Any pop is a good pop these days.  O'Reilly: Oil has been in a downtrend, for our listeners who may or may not be aware, as U.S. production keeps going up in spite of statements by OPEC that they will likely cut production for another nine months. The Saudi Aramco IPO is my only explanation.  Muckerman: Shale has them in an arm bar right now, ready to choke them out.  O'Reilly: Like we talked about last week, U.S. production is almost back to where it was at the peak in the summer of 2014. I think it was 9.6 million barrels back then, we're up to 9.3 after an 8.4 bottom. Anyway, prices of West Texas Intermediate rose as much as 4%, I think they settled at 3%.  Muckerman: Yeah, I think they closed at 3%.  O'Reilly: On news of a surprise domestic inventory draw from the EIA of 5.4 million barrels, I think they're projecting a couple hundred thousand increase, who knows, as well as statements by Saudi Arabia that production, they might cut into the first quarter of 2018.  Muckerman: And you had a couple of the countries come out in support of that yesterday.  O'Reilly: You can smell the desperation from those guys. Maybe it'll work?  Muckerman: It hasn't worked yet.  O'Reilly: Yeah. We'll wait a while. But we've been talking about this for two years. We started doing this together, and this was like, ""Oil prices just fell 50%.""  Muckerman: Why are we even doing this show? [laughs]   O'Reilly: [laughs] Yeah, actually, we should make this the industrials show, not the energy show.  Muckerman: This is like when Motley Fool Pro started in the depths of the financial crisis.  O'Reilly: Yeah, it's like, nobody is going to do this.  Muckerman: But, if you look at it now, it's crushing the market, and so are we.  O'Reilly: That's right!  Muckerman: We've been way out ahead of this telling people to cool their jets, oil prices aren't going anywhere fast.  O'Reilly: Cool your jets, because God knows nobody knows what's going on.  Muckerman: Exactly.  O'Reilly: So, we need to do earnings. What do you have for me? I know you had some good ones picked out.  Muckerman: We'll cover some of the big guys. You had a couple dividend raises, surprisingly.  O'Reilly: No way, who?  Muckerman: Exxon, Phillips 66, and Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), to name a few. No dividend cuts this quarter so far. That's a good sign. I don't know if they should be raising dividends at the moment, but at least we're seeing some stability here.  O'Reilly: They're like Bon Jovi, they're ""Livin' on a Prayer.""  Muckerman: Very strong for earnings compared to last year. They had some easy comps. And the cost cuts are about fully baked in, so the margins are helping out a little bit there. But Exxon's $4 billion profit was a 122% increase from the first quarter of last year, and they almost doubled cash flow.  O'Reilly: That's what I'm pulling up here, I have to see for myself.  Muckerman: Yeah, cash flow of $8.2 billion versus $4.8 billion last year in the first quarter.   O'Reilly: I have to think, last year, that was helped with the refinery margins. So now, it's a flip-flop of some sort.  Muckerman: Yeah, but they actually produced less oil on an equivalent oil basis, year over year, of like 5%.  O'Reilly: Yeah, there it is. Not that I didn't believe you, but cash from operations over at Exxon, over $8 billion, and capex of $2.89 billion. That's $5 billion in free cash flow.  Muckerman: Yeah. Lowering capex is really helping some of these companies out. You look at Shell, $9.5 billion in cash flow.  O'Reilly: Long term, that's bad. But for now...  Muckerman: Yeah, long term, that could be bad. So, you see Shell covering their dividend with cash flow, and being able to do stuff.  O'Reilly: They bought $3 billion in stock, did you see that?  Muckerman: Who did?  O'Reilly: Exxon. They bought back $3 billion in stock in the quarter.  Muckerman: Oh. That's nothing new for them, to return money to shareholders.  O'Reilly: Yeah. They've literally said, we'll take on debt to do it. [laughs] Remember when [Fool energy analyst Tyler] Crowe used to be like, ""They're just taking on debt and paying it out."" I was like ... Exxon is special.  Muckerman: Yeah, they are special, and they're big enough to be special. If you look at some of the sell-offs that we've had in the last couple years, if you take Exxon and Chevron, they account for 40% of the S&P 500 energy sector.  O'Reilly: Oh my gosh. The stock hasn't even fallen that much.  Muckerman: No. They're just so dang big.  O'Reilly: Good for them. Why did you bring up Cabot?  Muckerman: Cabot Oil & Gas? Because they actually raised their dividend, along with Phillips 66 and Exxon.  O'Reilly: Oh, that's right, what was up with that?  Muckerman: I didn't dive too deep into their earnings to be able to tell folks my opinion on whether or not it was prudent. But they're not necessarily as big as the other companies raising their dividend, so it came as a bit of a surprise to me. But you're seeing integrateds, you're seeing refiners, you're seeing upstream oil and gas companies. So, there's a decent mix of companies raising their dividends. But then again, nobody has cut the dividend yet.  O'Reilly: Well, they did last year.  Muckerman: This quarter. No, last year...  O'Reilly: Yeah, Cabot was free cash flow positive. $269 million cash from operations in the quarter, $208 million capex.  Muckerman: Yeah, you saw it last year, Conoco, Kinder [Morgan], Anadarko, Chesapeake, you name it, they were all cutting dividends last year.   O'Reilly: I have to wonder what's going on in these boardrooms. They're just like, ""OK, one of the reasons people invest in us is for these dividends, let's call a spade a spade.""  Muckerman: Yeah, for better or for worse, investing in energy is dividend-oriented for a lot of people, yeah.  O'Reilly: So, they plugged their noses last year, and were like, ""OK, we're going to cut. We'll probably get a pass because this is the Dark Ages of oil prices.""  Muckerman: Yeah, ""We're not the only company doing it."" Some of them didn't get a pass, though. Some of them sold off quite significantly because of it.  O'Reilly: Yeah, and some went under. [laughs] I have to wonder, you see the capex cuts, and that's going to have ramifications long term. They're not finding more oil --  Muckerman: Not that they're not finding it, they're just not really trying to find it and develop it.  O'Reilly: Yeah. That money will have to be invested at some point.  Muckerman: That's what people are saying. There could be a supply crunch in the early 2020s, is what they're saying, because a lot of the projects that folks were investing heavily in in 2013 and 2012 to 2014 are now coming on line, and they're not replacing that pipeline, so to speak. So, there are some worries. It all depends on how demand fares over the next five to six years, though.  O'Reilly: You brought something up really cool last week, when we were talking about Suncor.  Muckerman: I did? [laughs]   O'Reilly: Yeah, it does happen. Your cool thing this episode was the soccer stuff. But we were talking about Suncor, and how they have really high hurdles for internal returns on projects. And I was like, ""Why doesn't everybody do that?"" And you were like, ""I don't know."" It's a fun question.  Muckerman: I said I don't know in a humorous way because it makes sense.  O'Reilly: Right. It's just, I would love to see the internal spreadsheets, because you know they all have them. A business has three things they can do with money.  Muckerman: What's that, Sean?  O'Reilly: They can invest -- really?  Muckerman: Tell people.  O'Reilly: Oh, got it, sorry. ""What's that, Sean?""  Muckerman: [laughs] It's a leading question.  O'Reilly: If Apple or Berkshire Hathaway or an oil company, anybody, and Berkshire has, what, $96 billion in cash?  Muckerman: There's a lot.  O'Reilly: He's trying to catch up to Apple.  Muckerman: He has to keep some of it for insurance purposes. But, yeah, around half of that or maybe a little bit more is definitely some funny money. Or, fun money, not funny money. It's real, but it's fun.   O'Reilly: Yeah, $96 billion is fun. But, bottom line, any company, you can either pay it out as a dividend, they can invest it in operations, or they can buy back stock. I'm including in operations, they're buying another company.  Muckerman: Yeah, M&A, capex.  O'Reilly: So, I'm very curious, you saw Exxon bought back $3 billion worth of stock in the quarter, you saw the dividend, they're both increasing their dividends, I want to know, because it requires some judgment as to what you think your stock is worth, to be doing that stuff. And by paying the dividend, you're saying, ""We think our investors can make a better return,"" let's call it 8[%]-9%, or whatever you want to call it. ""We're saying that our investors, after taxes, can do better with this money than we can internally."" I would love to see what these guys think of all that. If they're doing it just for an obligatory reason, that kind of insults capitalism and such.  Muckerman: Yeah. Well, Warren Buffett addressed that.  O'Reilly: He has yet to pay a dividend.  Muckerman: Yeah, he's yet to pay a dividend. No one that I know of has asked him to pay one, because generally, they trust Warren Buffett.  O'Reilly: He beats that 8[%]-9% number.  Muckerman: Yeah. His annual return since Berkshire is like 17%, maybe 21%. Either way, it's crushing the market. But he's getting to that point where he's even starting to question --  O'Reilly: His ability to do it. And it's a size problem.  Muckerman: ""Maybe I have too much cash to actually find opportunities to help people out.""  O'Reilly: He's still as smart, it's just a size problem.  Muckerman: Yeah. And because he has a specific benchmark to where he'll buy back stock. It's not like he just wakes up one morning and is like, ""I'm going to buy back stock today."" It has to be 1.2 times book value, at that level where he's like, ""OK, now I'm thinking about it.""  O'Reilly: And it barely got there in the financial crisis, and that was it.  Muckerman: Yeah. I'm trying to find some numbers on some buybacks that we've seen. Share buybacks, we're looking at almost $160 billion in share buybacks right now.  O'Reilly: That's crazy.  Muckerman: Since mid-2010, it's been nothing but up and to the [right]. Back in 2010, it was less than $60 billion annually, or, rolling four-quarter average. Now, you're right around $150 billion.  O'Reilly: With the market at all-time highs.  Muckerman: With the market at all-time highs. I guess, yeah, you're buying share prices at higher values. That's going to increase the amount of money you're spending if you're buying a set number of shares. But, yeah, around $90 billion higher. Not that they bought $90 billion over that time period. But that the past rolling four quarters, they bought $90 billion more than they did in 2010.  O'Reilly: Yeah. In 2010, when all those buybacks started to roll out, I remember Disney announced a huge one and all that stuff, in 2010. I was wondering, ""Where was this two years ago?""  Muckerman: Yeah, you saw the financial crisis, and people just stopped buying back shares. Took a nosedive.  O'Reilly: That's when you do it!  Muckerman: They waited until mid-2010, and it just hasn't abated since.  O'Reilly: Oh well. So, criticisms of corporate America aside, really quick before we head out, gasoline taxes. This is a fun little article you sent me.  Muckerman: Oh, God, gasoline tax, don't mention it. But we have to.  O'Reilly: The South Carolina House voted Tuesday to approve a legislative compromise plan that would raise the state's 16.75-cent gasoline tax by $0.12 over the next six years.  Muckerman: That's a hefty increase.  O'Reilly: It's to pay for roads.   Muckerman: You look at it, it's the second-lowest statewide gas tax in the country.   O'Reilly: Five lowest is Mississippi at 18.8, Missouri at 17.3, Oklahoma, then South Carolina and Alaska.  Muckerman: Alaska obviously last at 12.3.  O'Reilly: Pennsylvania is $0.60 per gallon. That's No. 1, kids.  Muckerman: They need to start producing more oil and less natural gas up there in Pennsylvania. So, you look at this and, companies are voicing their opinion in South Carolina, saying that you need to raise more tax from gas because your roads are in such disrepair, and the delays that these congested roads are causing are hampering our business. And they're going to roll it out over six years, if it's finally approved. But I think that states need to start coming around to this. It's kind of a user-pay tax, because if you're driving, you're buying gas, you're using the roads. Even people that aren't driving, like myself, we still need our goods delivered, so we need roads for that. But I'm going to leave listeners with a question to ponder, because we have to hop off here in one minute: What happens when nobody is buying gas? Who's going to pay for these roads when electric vehicles are dominating?  O'Reilly: Ooh, that's a fun one. All right, that is it for us, folks.

","Big Oil Earnings Highlights From ExxonMobil, Phillips 66, and More"
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/08/these-3-stocks-just-raised-their-dividends.aspx,2017-05-08,"
Earnings season has hit its peak, and as usual, there have been more than the typical number of dividend raises from companies.
In the final week of April, there were around 40, by my count, thus far more than enough from which to choose our usual trio. Without further ado, here are my latest and greatest picks.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES

IBM
Longtime tech industry veteran IBM (NYSE:IBM) has declared that its next quarterly dividend will be $1.50 per share. That tops the most recent payout by 7%. 
Unlike the two other stocks we'll be looking at, IBM isn't a dividend aristocrat -- one of the rare stocks that has lifted its payout at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years in a row. It's inching toward that status, however, as this is its 22nd consecutive annual bump.
However, IBM is also building a streak that's pointed in the opposite direction. The company has reported 20 straight quarters of declining revenue; its latest frame saw the top line erode by 3%, with net income slumping by 13%. ""Big Blue"" has seen gains in certain segments, particularly cloud computing, but they aren't enough to lift those numbers.

Still, the old giant has plenty of financial muscle. It's been consistently operating and free cash flow positive, and although those two line items haven't grown significantly, they remain more than sufficient to cover both the dividend and the company's share repurchases. That's important, because IBM pays a dividend that is quite juicy for the tech sector; in fact, it's one of the key attractions of the stock these days.
IBM's upcoming distribution is to be paid on June 10 to stockholders of record as of May 10. It would yield just under 3.8%, well exceeding the current 1.9% average of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500.
Johnson & Johnson
Our first dividend aristocrat up to bat for this article is healthcare stalwart Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The company is extending its dividend-raising streak to 55 years in a row, with a 5% bump in its quarterly payout to $0.84 per share.

JNJ Dividend data by YCharts
That raise is actually fairly modest for the company; in fact, as my Foolish colleague Sean Williams points out, it's the lowest so far this decade.
That stands to reason, as it's in the process of swallowing its monster acquisition, European biotech company Actelion. The $30 billion deal is Johnson & Johnson's largest acquisition in history, and it'll put a dent in the finances.
Yet it has the potential to boost the American company's profitability going forward by 1.5% to 2% annually. That would be a relief, as Johnson & Johnson's Q1 sales crept up less than 2% on a year-over-year basis on weak domestic and European sales. Meanwhile, net income declined marginally.
At the same time, it continues to spend the bulk of (or even a bit more than) its free cash flow on the dividend and share buybacks. For a normal company, this would be a concern, but this is not a normal company. It's irrevocably associated with the dividend aristocrats and is likely to do its utmost to retain that status. Weaker results and pricey acquisitions notwithstanding, it's got the cash pile to do so, and I fully expect it will.
Johnson & Johnson's new payout will be dispensed on June 13 to shareholders of record as of May 30. It yields a theoretical 2.7%.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-7344');
            });
        

ExxonMobil
Dividend aristocrat No. 2 in our lineup this week is ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). The oil and gas behemoth is nudging its quarterly distribution 3% higher to $0.77 per share.  
This is a good time for a raise. Like other energy majors, the company has been doing relatively well of late. The cause, naturally, is oil prices, which have staged a mini-rebound of sorts. Although still not where they were before the 2014 crash, they're significantly above the depressed levels of this time last year.

Brent Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts
As a result, and thanks to cost-cutting and other measures, ExxonMobil's estimates have it earning just over $4 billion for its Q1 2017, an amount that would be more than double the result of the year-ago quarter. Revenue and other income are poised to increase by almost 30%, topping $63 billion.
That means both cash from operations and free cash flow are again on the rise. In fact, the latter figure grew nearly twentyfoldfold year over year to $4 billion, which should help support that new dividend. Unless the oil price sees another huge dive -- and perhaps not even then -- I'd imagine ExxonMobil will continue to find the scratch for its payout.
ExxonMobil will pay its enhanced dividend on June 9 to investors of record as of May 12. At the most recent closing stock price, the new amount would yield 3.8%. 

",These 3 Stocks Just Raised Their Dividends
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/26/these-4-banks-paid-33-billion-in-taxes-over-the-pa.aspx,2017-04-26,"
Bank stocks have been surging again over the past few days, as the outcome of the presidential election in France, as well as Donald Trump's vow to lower the corporate tax rate, is buoying investor sentiment toward the sector. Most recently, Trump reiterated his support earlier this week for lowering the corporate income tax rate from a high of 35% down to only 15%.
Given that taxes impact a bank's net income in the same way operating expenses do, a substantial drop in the top rate as envisioned by Trump would translate into a meaningful increase in most banks' bottom lines. That said, some banks stand to benefit more than others. At the top of the list are JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C).

Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author.

These are the nation's four biggest banks, with assets ranging from $1.8 trillion in Citigroup's case up to $2.6 trillion at JPMorgan Chase. Not surprisingly, these banks also outearn their peers, with net incomes over the trailing 12 months ranging from $15 billion to $26 billion.
Those aren't just big numbers in the bank industry, either. Aside from Apple, no other company on the S&P 500 generated more earnings than JPMorgan Chase did over the past year. And Wells Fargo and Bank of America aren't far behind, ranking fourth and sixth, respectively, on the large-cap stock index.

But there's a downside to massive profitability: corporate income taxes. All told, these four banks paid $33 billion in taxes since this time last year. That's a lot of mullah that, under Trump's tax proposal, could be redirected toward dividends and stock buybacks.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-13443');
            });
        


Wells Fargo would see the biggest benefit. According to data from YCharts.com, the California-based bank would see its annual tax liability drop by $4.8 billion if it was taxed at 15% as opposed to the 30% effective tax rate it paid over the last 12 months. JPMorgan Chase would come in second, realizing a $4.3 billion benefit. And Bank of America and Citigroup round out the top four; they would save around $3.2 billion each.

Bank of America


$7.11 billion


$3.24 billion




Citigroup


$6.44 billion


$3.22 billion

There's no getting around the fact that this would be good news for these banks, as well as their shareholders. At the same time, however, the expectation that the corporate income tax rate will in fact fall already appears to be priced into these banks' stock. This helps to explain why their shares are up between 18% and 44% since the beginning of November. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is up 13% over the same stretch, while the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks, has climbed 24%.
The net result is that, if Trump's tax plans don't come to fruition, which doesn't seem entirely unlikely given the impact of the cuts on the federal deficit, these four bank stocks and others could be in for a correction.

Between 1965 and 2015, the U.S. adult smoking rate plunged from 42% to 15%, due to tougher anti-smoking regulations and higher excise taxes. Yet that decline didn't deter top tobacco companies in the U.S. like Altria (NYSE:MO), Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI), and Vector Group (NYSE:VGR).

Data source: Company earnings reports. Chart by author.

Altria's flagship Marlboro brand remains the top brand in America, with a whopping 44% of the market. The rest of the market is dominated by Reynolds American's Camel, Newport, Pall Mall, and Natural American Spirit brands, as well as Vector Group's Pyramid and Eve brands.
These companies grew their bottom lines by raising prices to offset declining shipments, cutting costs, expanding into adjacent markets like e-cigarettes, and consolidating the market. That's why Reynolds bought former third-place player Lorillard, and why British American Tobacco will soon acquire Reynolds to become the second-largest U.S. tobacco company.
U.S. tobacco companies will likely keep growing, since the average price of a pack of cigarettes across the U.S. remains lower than other markets with comparable smoking rates. So despite their controversial reputations, tobacco stocks could remain core holdings of conservative investors for the foreseeable future.

The Nasdaq Composite index is off to a great start in 2016, surging 13% higher year to date and nearly doubling the S&P 500's returns. There are no guarantees that the tech-heavy index will continue to crush the market in 2017, but we called together three top Motley Fool contributors to share their best tech investments for this moment in time.
Read on to see why our panelists recommend Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Sierra Wireless (NASDAQ:SWIR) right now.

Image source: Getty Images.

It's time for this young stock to find its sea legs
Anders Bylund (Twilio): Twilio is a provider of cloud-based communication tools around which other companies can build their own digital voice, video, and messaging applications. It's a small cap and a fairly fresh addition to the public markets, having launched its original share offering in June 2016.
Investors are still feeling out this new stock. Share prices topped out above $70 in September, only to crash back down to $30 per share in early November. Sharp drops and jumps are par for the course here, often triggered by Twilio's earnings reports.
The recent first-quarter release was no exception. Twilio leveraged its IPO cash into a 40% higher customer count and 47% higher quarterly sales, compared with the year-ago period. But leading customer Uber is kicking its Twilio habit, leading to deep cuts in Twilio's full-year earnings guidance.
Twilio shares fell as much as 29% the next day.
The stock now trades more than 60% below those late-September highs and 13% below Twilio's first day of trading. I'll admit that it's hard to draw a bead on Twilio's true long-term value, since every quarterly report so far has showed negative operating profits, even deeper net losses, and smaller but still significant cash burns. If you're into rock-solid financial fundamentals, Twilio is not your bag.
But if you can harness some risk and uncertain valuations, buying some Twilio shares on deep dips like this one could make plenty of sense. The Uber situation is not ideal but also not the end of the world, thanks to explosive growth in the number of client accounts. Top-line sales are following suit, and gross margin stands at 59% today -- up from 55% at the end of March, 2016.
Twilio's management is still learning the ropes of setting correct and reachable expectations, but the company is also doing many things right. And right now, the stock is on sale -- at least compared with Twilio's short trading history. Might be worth a curious nibble, methinks.
This winner will keep on winning
Steve Symington (Sierra Wireless): When I singled out Sierra Wireless in February as a tech stock that could make you rich, shares of the Internet of Things pure play were already up big so far in 2017. Sure enough, Sierra Wireless stock continued to rebound last week, climbing another 15% on Friday, after it announced strong first-quarter 2017 results. But with shares still well below their 2015 highs -- when shorter-term mobile headwinds and weak demand from certain existing OEM customers caused the stock to plunge -- I think Sierra Wireless still has plenty of room to rise from here.
After all, the company is not only enjoying renewed demand from those established OEM customers, but also seeing programs ramp up from new customers in its core OEM segment -- where revenue climbed a modest 10% year over year, to $133 million, last quarter. Meanwhile, Sierra Wireless' enterprise-solutions business climbed 44.8%, to $21.7 million, thanks to a combination of demand for new products, investments in go-to-market capabilities, and contributions from acquired businesses.
Most recently on the latter, Sierra Wireless astutely spent $3.2 million to acquire GlobalTop Technology's Global Navigation Satellite System business, expanding its portfolio of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth modules to improve its position in key markets such as telematics, drones, and automotive. Meanwhile, Sierra Wireless is only just getting started in building its pipeline for the younger cloud and connectivity services segment -- where revenue rose 2.1%, to $7.1 million -- by drawing upon the customer bases and complementary products of its more mature business lines.
In short, Sierra Wireless is rightly focused on positioning itself to take and hold market share in these early stages of its long-term growth story. And I think investors with the foresight to pick up shares before the rest of the market realizes just how big that story is stand to be handsomely rewarded.

            });
        

Falling behind the tech stock surge
Tim Green (Qualcomm): While the tech-heavy Nasdaq has been carving out all-time highs, shares of mobile-chip kingpin Qualcomm haven't been so lucky. The stock has slumped over the past few months because of legal feuds with both Apple and the Federal Trade Commission. The former accused the company of charging excessive royalties, and the latter charged it with anti-competitive business practices.
The bulk of Qualcomm's profit comes from licensing, so any threat to that cash cow of a business should be taken seriously by investors. Qualcomm was forced to slash its third-quarter guidance after Apple informed it that it was withholding royalty payments to its contract manufacturers. Qualcomm expects revenue to take a $500 million hit compared with its previous guidance.
How these legal matters ultimately shake out is impossible to predict. But investors who believe that Qualcomm will prevail, or at most pay a small fine and get on with its business, can take advantage of the uncertainty and pick up shares at a depressed price. Backing out the net cash and investments on the balance sheet, Qualcomm trades for just over 11 times fiscal 2016 earnings. The bottom line will take a hit in the near term because of Apple's actions, but a positive outcome for Qualcomm could send the stock soaring down the road. 
",3 Tech Stocks for May
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/06/disney-earnings-are-on-tap-heres-what-to-watch.aspx,2017-05-06,"
Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) reports its second-quarter results for fiscal 2017 after the market close on Tuesday, May 9. 
The entertainment giant is going into its report on a pretty note, with its Beauty and the Beast (2017) reigning as 2017's top-grossing movie worldwide, as of the time of writing. However, the year-over-year comparison bar is very high for studio entertainment, so investors should keep their expectations realistic.
Since November, shares of Disney have bounced back nicely from their decline that began in August 2015 due to what's so far proven to be overblown fears about cable cord-cutting negatively affecting the company's overall financial results. In 2017, Disney's stock has returned 9.8%, versus the S&P 500's 7.5%, as of May 2.

Image source: Disney.

The headline numbers
Here are the previous period's results to use as benchmarks: 




Metric

Q2 2016 Result





Revenue


$12.97 billion




Segment operating income


$3.82 billion




Net income


$2.14 billion




Adjusted earnings per share (EPS)


$1.36




Data source: Disney.
Disney doesn't provide earnings guidance. Analysts are expecting it will earn $1.41 per share on revenue of $13.45 billion, representing year-over-year increases of 3.7% for both metrics. Long-term investors shouldn't pay too much attention to Wall Street's near-term estimates, but they can be handy to know because they can help make sense out of market reactions
Beyond the headline numbers, here's what to watch in the report:
Media networks: Cable results and streaming service plans
Investors know the drill by now, as it's been nearly two years since it came into focus that Disney has been steadily losing ESPN subscribers due to consumers increasingly cutting or slimming down their big cable packages, or not signing up for cable in the first place. Focus should remain on results in the cable portion of the media networks business and how the company is navigating the changes in the consumer TV-viewing market. 
On that note, since we're now a third of the way through 2017, investors should soon be hearing from Disney's management regarding when it plans to use its BAMTech stake, acquired last fall, to launch its ESPN-branded multisport subscription streaming service. As of the last earnings call, this launch remained slated for 2017.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-43055');
            });
        

Parks and resorts: Another solid quarter?
It seems likely that parks and resorts will once again turn in solid results. The shift in the timing of the New Year's holiday relative to Disney's fiscal periods will have a positive impact this quarter, whereas it had a negative impact last quarter. (The New Year holiday fell within the first quarter of fiscal 2016, but fell within the second quarter this year.) Revenue results will also get a boost from Shanghai Disney, as the massive park opened last June, so it wasn't included in the company's second-quarter results last year. CEO Bob Iger said on the last earnings call that the park was ""enormously popular"" over the Chinese New Year holiday in late January through early February.  
Investors should continue to monitor attendance at Disney's domestic parks, though keep in mind that quarterly results will always be a little lumpy due to various factors that affect comparability. Last quarter, domestic attendance declined 5% year over year; however, if we exclude the one-time factors and the impact from the shift in the fiscal calendar, attendance declined only 1%. 

Image source: Disney.

Studio entertainment: Expect another tough comparable
As with last quarter, Disney faces a tough comparable in its movie business. The company churned out yet another blockbuster with its Beauty and the Beast (2017), which opened domestically on March 17, so about two weeks of its theatrical receipts will be included in the quarter's results. This should prove to be a tidy sum because the live-action/animated film has taken in more than $1.43 billion, as of May 2. Moreover, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which opened in mid-December, should once again make a princely contribution to Disney's quarterly coffers.
However, the quarter's results will almost surely fall short of studio's powerful results in the year-ago period. In that quarter, Disney's year-over-year revenue and operating income soared 22% and 27%, respectively, driven by the megasuccessful Star Wars: The Force Awakens, released domestically before the holidays in 2015. Additionally, the first month's box-office take of animated hit Zootopia was included in that quarter. 
In short, investors should keep expectations in check and keep in mind that Iger has said that fiscal 2017 will be a slower-growth year, but the company's more recent robust growth dynamics will continue in fiscal 2018.

The Nasdaq Composite, an index made up of many of the top U.S. IT stocks, has outperformed more diversified benchmarks such as the S&P 500 over the past one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods, led by compelling performances from technology companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Many of these leading IT stocks remain fantastic investments, even as their market caps continue to swell to once-unfathomable heights. So let's further examine what makes these tech giants compelling stocks to buy today.
What makes Apple a top IT stock
Apple shares have been on quite the tear lately, gaining 46% over the past 12 months. However, the world's largest tech company sports some of the strongest fundamentals in in the industry and should be strongly considered as a core technology stock for many long-term portfolios.
Thanks to the popularity of its iEmpire of consumer electronics, Apple's annual revenue consistently exceeds $200 billion. Moreover, the company's high-end price points give it a plum profit margin -- 39% on average over the past five years -- which makes the company a cash cow whose net cash balance is $158 billion and growing. The much-anticipated release of the iPhone 8 later this year and a host of potential high-impact projects should enable Apple to remain a top IT stock for years to come.

What makes Alphabet a top IT stock
The company that rules the Internet, Alphabet -- much like Apple and Amazon -- has only continued to strengthen its dominant business model in recent years. High-profile initiatives such as self-driving cars, Internet-beaming balloons, and the like make Alphabet seem like the corporate equivalent of a sixth-grade science experiment on steroids. However, in terms of tracking its profit generation, Alphabet is fairly straightforward. The company's original Google search and online advertising business generates nearly all the company's sales and profits. Better still, research continues to show that Alphabet and Facebook continue to capture increasingly large shares of the online advertising market. 
The future remains bright for Alphabet. The online advertising market remains ripe for consolidation; analysts expect the space to grow from $550 billion in 2016 to $724 billion in 2020. Moreover, as often detailed by the press, Alphabet is fast at work developing new, innovative technologies. The company, like the others on the list, is busy skating where the puck is heading, and that tends to be a highly profitable strategy in the world of investing.

            });
        

What makes Amazon a top IT stock
The top e-commerce company in the world has been in operation for more than 20 years now, but, in many ways, Amazon is just getting started, a fact many investors overlook. In this vein, it's important to consider the revolution Amazon is spearheading in the way we buy and sell items, and the true enormity of its growth potential.
At the end of last year, e-commerce accounted for just 8.3% of all U.S. retail sales.  The number is strikingly similar worldwide, where an estimated 8.7% of all retail transactions occurred online in 2016, according to eMarketer. It's difficult to estimate the exact percentage of retail transactions that can and should take place online, but it's probably safe to say the long-term figure is substantially higher than the high single digits. And rest assured, Amazon intends to capture as much of this future market share as reality will allow.
The company's e-commerce dominance, plus its high-margin Amazon Web Services cloud segment, have Wall Street estimating Amazon will grow its EPS at a 29% average annual rate over the next five years. 
Of course, achieving this goal won't happen quickly or without its fair share of challengers. In that vein, regional e-commerce companies such as MercadoLibre in Latin America are fast at work establishing their own e-commerce ecosystems. Similarly, American retail power Wal-Mart seems to finally have given e-commerce its appropriate focus; I believe its 2016 acquisition of Jet.com will be looked back on as a watershed moment for the company. 
However, Amazon is a unique company in many respects. Its extremely long-term focus and its ability and willingness to create innovative solutions to pain points throughout the global retail supply chain is without equal. There's enough room to accommodate multiple large-scale winners in the global retail industry, where sales are expected to rise to over $27 trillion by 2020, but  Amazon remains the top pick in this space. Like Apple and Alphabet, it's one of the best technology stocks to own right now. 
",3 IT Stocks to Buy Now
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/07/3-things-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-this-week.aspx,2017-05-07,"
Stocks inched back into record territory last week thanks to a mix of strong corporate earnings reports and economic data showing a healthy U.S. job market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) passed 21,000 points while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) notched a 7% gain so far for the year.

Data by YCharts.
Earnings season rolls on over the coming week, with a few of the most anticipated reports set to be released coming from Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM). Here are a few trends for investors to watch in the announcements.
Disney's studio business
Disney will announce results for its fiscal second quarter after the market closes on Tuesday. The entertainment giant's stock has been close to new highs despite recent struggles in the core TV media properties and a sharp drop in profits from other segments. Last quarter, after all, earnings fell 7% as an uptick in the parks and resorts business failed to fully offset double-digit drops in the studio and consumer products divisions.

Image source: Disney.

CEO Bob Iger and his team are bracing for slightly lower operating results this fiscal year following six straight years of record numbers. That dip is mainly an artifact of the release schedule around the Star Wars franchise, though, since last year's results benefited from soaring box office, home entertainment, and consumer products sales tied to the reboot of the brand. Disney's having another great year in theaters so far (thanks, Beauty and the Beast), but improving on 2016's record outing won't likely happen until after the next installment in the Star Wars franchise hits theaters -- and licensed toys begin selling at retailers -- later in the year.
NVIDIA's growth targets
NVIDIA shares are trailing the market so far in 2017 but remain up roughly 200% over the past 12 months. The chipmaker has seen sharply accelerating sales growth lately, and its prime position in exciting industries like self-driving automobiles, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing has investors salivating at its long-term opportunities.
The good news for shareholders is that NVIDIA has paired strong sales gains with equally impressive profitability growth. Gross margin, in fact, jumped by over 3 percentage points last quarter to reach 60% of sales.
CEO Jensen Huang and his executive team are targeting about the same profitability level to kick off its 2018 fiscal year as revenue rises to $1.9 billion -- up 46%. Investors will be keeping a close watch on NVIDIA's projected growth path from there, in addition to any spending and pricing plans that might sacrifice short-term profits in exchange for market-share growth. The company reports on Tuesday after market close.

Whole Foods' long-term plans
Whole Foods stock is up big this year, mainly thanks to grumblings from activist shareholders that indicate the grocery chain may end up going private in the near future. Several of the company's biggest shareholders are nudging management in that direction as they look for ways to revitalize the stock following a string of disappointing operating results. Last quarter, for example, comparable-store sales fell 3% due to a sharp decline in customer traffic.

Image source: Getty Images.

CEO John Mackey said increasing competition has forced management to look at ""refining our growth strategy, refocusing our efforts on best serving our core customers, and moving faster to fully implement category management.""
Those goals will likely be easier to achieve away from the relentless pressure of public markets pushing for immediate operating improvements. There's no guarantee that Whole Foods will find a buyer, though, or that the price will represent good value for shareholders who have seen their stock drop sharply since setting an all-time high in early 2014.

",3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/03/why-twilio-frontier-communications-and-sprint-slum.aspx,2017-05-03,"
Wednesday was another mixed day on Wall Street, with technology stocks weighing down the Nasdaq Composite but the Dow and S&P 500 finishing very close to the unchanged level. Many market participants were watching for clues on monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, which completed its May meeting without making a change to interest rates but left open the potential for a future hike as soon as next month. Even though cross-currents left the overall market roughly in balance, some stocks took big hits, and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR), and Sprint (NYSE:S) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Twilio dives on a big customer loss
Shares of Twilio dropped 26% after the communications software specialist reported its first-quarter financial results. The company's backward-looking performance wasn't all that bad, with revenue climbing by nearly half compared to the first quarter of 2016 and adjusted net losses remaining fairly consistent with year-ago levels. But what sent the stock down sharply was Twilio's future guidance, which reflects ""some changes in the relationship with our largest customer,"" ride-sharing company Uber. Twilio still expects Uber to remain important, but it no longer relies exclusively on Twilio, and that led to a substantial cut in full-year expectations for 2017. With the company now seeing slower sales growth ahead and expecting a worse annual adjusted loss than previously indicated, investors worry that Twilio could have difficulty adjusting to changing conditions.

Frontier hits multidecade lows after dividend cut
Frontier stock plunged to its lowest levels since the mid-1980s, falling 17% in the wake of the company's first-quarter report and a long-anticipated decision to cut its dividend. The telecom company said that revenue dropped 2% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, with residential customer counts falling by roughly 155,000 to 4.74 million. Furthermore, Frontier saw declining numbers of enterprise, broadband, and video subscribers, with higher customer churn figures from its recently acquired business in California, Florida, and Texas. Yet for income investors, the worst news came from Frontier's decision to cut its dividend by 62% to $0.04 per share. Although lower leverage figures might be good for Frontier's business in the long run, the dividend was all that was keeping some shareholders interested in the stock, and the decline to 34-year lows reflects the loss of optimism from diehard dividend investors.

            });
        

Sprint's turnaround fails to inspire investors
Finally, shares of Sprint finished with a 14% loss on the day. The wireless network provider reported fiscal fourth-quarter results today, and on their face, news of huge subscriber growth seemed like a positive for Sprint. Yet despite stronger revenue than expected, Sprint's quarterly loss was wider than most people expected. Moreover, some comments from CEO Marcelo Claure noting that the company is ""open to many different possibilities,"" including a merger or acquisition, didn't seem to be what investors had wanted to hear in terms of what Sprint's long-term strategic vision might be. For now, shareholders will have to wait and see whether Sprint's ongoing efforts eventually make a bigger impact on quarterly results and spur increases in the telecom's share price.

","Why Twilio, Frontier Communications, and Sprint Slumped Today"
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/08/3-beaten-up-big-brand-stocks-are-they-bargains.aspx,2017-05-08,"
Too often when a company has been beaten down, investors think they need to sell. If everyone else is getting out, the thinking goes, you should, too. But that may not be the right way to view it. Sometimes, when a stock goes on sale, it's time to buy more.
That doesn't mean you run out and buy every stock that suffers a big drop. A cheap stock can also be cheap for a reason. So read on to find out if Kate Spade (NYSE:KATE), Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), and Under Armour (NYSE:UA), which have all fallen sharply from their 52-week week highs, are stocks to run away from or bargains waiting to be snatched up.

Image source: Kate Spade.

Kate Spade
The prognosis doesn't look good for handbag maker Kate Spade, which seems to be simply waiting for someone -- anyone! -- to come along and make an offer to buy it out. The biggest problem may be no one is interested.
Although Reuters reported earlier this month that rival Coach (NYSE:COH) had put in a bid on the company, management reportedly needed more time to consider the offer and perhaps try to find someone willing to pay more. That suggests Coach made an especially low offer and thinks the company's business may be on the wane. Michael Kors, which has also been struggling, is also reportedly eying its rival, but nothing has materialized yet.
That could be because Kate Spade thinks too highly of itself. Its first-quarter results showed comparable-store sales falling 2.4% for the period, or more than 8% if you exclude e-commerce, its first quarterly decline in seven years. While its online efforts remain robust and grew at double-digit rates, the difficult retail environment at the mall is clearly evident here and serves as a drag on performance.
Kate Spade is being pushed to sell itself by activist investor Caerus Investors, which thinks the retailer deserves a premium as it transitions into becoming a so-called lifestyle brand. That's the same course Coach embarked on as its handbag sales began to falter. It wandered in the wilderness for years as it sought to form an identity, and only recently did it gain any sort of traction. Whether consumers consider the one-time aspirational luxury brand to be a lifestyle brand is probably up for debate, but Kate Spade's expansion beyond just handbags into shoes and other fashion gear is probably the reason Coach has an interest. It purchased luxury-shoe company Stuart Weitzman a few years ago, and that's been a bright spot since the beginning.
Kate Spade's stock has fallen 33% from its 52-week highs that were fueled by the takeover talk, only to crash after it seemed the Coach bid was failing. The stock does carry a discounted multiple that, if analyst expectations of a bid in the low-$20s are appropriate, could represent a nice 25% gain or so from their current levels. But that's only if someone actually comes through with a bid.

Mattel
Everything old is new again, at least when it comes to Mattel. The toymaker had been careening lower on poor sales but seemed to be turning things around with worldwide sales that were moving higher by high-single-digit percentage rates when factoring in currency fluctuations, and with almost all divisions -- including its aging Barbie brand -- showing growth. But then it reported its earnings last week, and all that newfound growth evaporated.
Net sales in North America plunged 23% as Barbie tumbled once again, falling 13% year over year, and other girls toys saw sales plummet 34%. Mattel blamed the performance on the weak Christmas selling season that left too much inventory on retailer shelves.
What the quarterly results did was also reveal the still-gaping hole left behind by the loss of Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Princess and Frozen doll lines. Rival Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) reported blowout numbers back in February as a result of having taken over the Disney dolls, reporting a 31% jump in partner brand revenue primarily because of having the Princess and Frozen dolls in its lineup for a full year. Where once Mattel looked as if it may have gotten itself back on track, even in the face of some lingering headwinds, it's clear now that it couldn't overcome the turbulence.
But Mattel's stock is now 34% below its recent high, and at 24 times earnings and just 12 times next year's earnings estimates, it's now not so richly valued. But sometimes a broken stock is broken for a reason, and investors should probably wait a while to see if the toymaker can repair itself before committing any money here.

            });
        

Under Armour
If there's one thing that Under Armour is not, it's undervalued. With a business that's weakening across most of its lines, a downward revision of its full-year 2018 revenue forecast, and a stock that's lost more than 63% of its value from its 52-week highs, Under Armour still trades at almost 40 times trailing earnings and 33 times next year's estimates, and it has a price-to-earnings ratio that's well more 7 times estimated long-term earnings growth.
In comparison, the stock of better-situated Nike (NYSE:NKE) goes off for just 23 times earnings, which is less than the S&P 500's multiple of 26 and nearly 22 times estimates. It also trades for just twice its earnings growth forecasts.
Analysts aren't expecting Under Armour to dazzle when it reports earnings later this week, and despite the prospects for better-than-expected footwear sales in some channels, the overall scheme looks to be set against the apparel maker. Barron's recently reported that Deutsche Bank's analyst thinks it will face an uphill challenge, particularly as Nike and Adidas have found their footing again.  And my Foolish colleague Jeremy Bowman just laid out how Under Armour is losing favor among teens, a key demographic for any retailer.
In short, even though Under Armour has fallen far, it may not be far enough and could head even lower following its next earnings report.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/08/mindbody-posts-healthy-32-revenue-growth-lowers-ea.aspx,2017-05-08,"
Mindbody (NASDAQ:MB) reported first-quarter 2017 results after the market closed on Thursday. The company, which provides an online platform for wellness-class providers that allows users to book classes across venues, experienced 32% year-over-year revenue growth while its adjusted loss per share narrowed to $0.03 from $0.12 in the year-ago period. 
Shares of Mindbody dropped 9.3% on Friday as investors seemed to react to the company's lowering its adjusted earnings guidance for full-year 2017. It's now forecasting a wider loss than it did last quarter when it established full-year guidance. Even after this drop, the stock had gained 69% over the one-year period through Friday, versus the S&P 500's total return of 19.5%. Since the company's June 2015 IPO, the stock is up a torrid 124%, as investors have been encouraged by the company's healthy revenue growth.

Both main segments experienced solid growth, with subscription and services revenue increasing 30% to $25 million, and payments revenue jumping 38% to $16.8 million. (There's also a very small ""other"" category.) 
Mindbody had guided for quarterly revenue in the range of $41.6 million to $42.6 million, so its revenue came in at about the midpoint of ts guidance. On the earnings end, it had guided for an adjusted loss in the range of $1.1 million to $2.1 million and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 40.8 million shares, which equates to an adjusted EPS loss in the range of $0.03 to $0.05. So its adjusted EPS result came in at the low end of its loss range. 
For additional context -- though long-term investors shouldn't pay too much attention to Wall Street's near-term estimates -- analysts were expecting Mindbody to post an adjusted EPS loss of $0.05 on revenue of $42.08 million. So the company beat Wall Street's earnings expectation and hit the revenue target.

Average monthly revenue per subscriber grew 15% year over year to approximately $230.
Payments volume increased 22% year over year to approximately $1.9 billion.
The company expanded its integration with Alphabet's Google to enable users across the United States to book fitness classes and buy class packages and memberships directly through Google Search and Maps.
Mindbody acquired mobile-technologies start-up Lymber Wellness, whose tech allows business owners to use dynamic pricing for classes and appointments to help maximize their yields.  
Weebly became a partner to provide subscribers with a website-building and e-commerce tool that incorporates Mindbody's branded web tech.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/29/the-market-will-probably-correct-but-dont-bet-on-w.aspx,2017-04-29,"
According to more than a few financial news sources and research notes, a correction in the market is likely going to happen in the next 10 to 20 years.
In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann explain why the experts are saying the market will correct, and how likely they are to be right; why it's so hard to predict what the market will do in the short term; how often even professionals get this kind of thing wrong; and why it's so hard to time the market.

A full transcript follows the video.







This video was recorded on April 21, 2017.

Dylan Lewis: I will lay out the argument for why there's probably a correction coming at some point in the next decade to 20 years, and what the financial media narrative has been. For people that aren't familiar, basically, the gist of it is, because of quantitative easing, which is basically the Fed getting money into the economy, making borrowing very cheap, interest rates have been historically low. They've been historically low for a very long amount of time. Because of those low yields, investors have been pushed into equities because they're looking for better returns. That demand drives up stocks into overvalued territory. That's what we see, that's the gist of all of these research notes that are saying the market is overvalued. Really, that line of thinking totally makes sense to me. My college economics coming back, I totally see the dots connecting there. And Hunter brings up great points with the data here. Typically, the S&P 500 on a trailing basis, P/E somewhere between 10 and 20. 
The problem, though, is that even if you're right with what your thesis is, when it comes to market timing and deciding, ""I'm going to wait three months to do anything,"" or, ""I'm going to sell now because it seems like we're at peaks,"" is you have to be right not only about the thesis, but you have to be right but the timing and when you act on it, and it's really tough to nail both of those things.
David Kretzmann: It's really tough. There are some interesting dynamics at play, and it's incredibly difficult to predict where the market is going in the short term. You have a lot of experts from the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, and high-ranking economists who were predicting before Brexit and the U.S. election that if Britain leaves the EU, and if Donald Trump is elected president, there's a very high likelihood that the market will crash. And lo and behold, the market is hitting new highs as a result. It's also interesting to look at what Warren Buffett has been doing. We traditionally see Buffett as more in that value mode as an investor. Between the U.S. election of Trump and early February, he was a net buyer of stocks. He bought over $20 billion of stocks, including Apple, which has been an incredible performer, and driving a good chunk of the returns of the S&P 500 this year. If a correction was coming, if a crash was coming, Buffett would be the last person I would expect to be buying stocks, because he tends to be a more conservative investor.

            });
        


To your point, Dylan, I think it's a great point, looking at interest rates. Interest rates are at historic lows. We haven't really navigated through prolonged periods of such low interest rates. When looking at investments, you have to look at the alternatives. If you're not going to invest in stocks right now, where are you going to invest? The U.S. Treasuries or bonds are yielding 2% to 3%, 10-Year Treasuries, which is very low. So, that's not very attractive. You could put it in your savings account, maybe 1%, if you're lucky, or less. So, you have to look at the alternatives. So, it's understandable to see why people are looking at the scope of investment possibilities right now. And they're gravitating toward stocks, even though, yeah, they look, on average, pricier than they typically have been. But compared to everything else, it still looks more attractive.
Lewis: Yeah. Bringing it back around to some historical examples, Hunter's question reminded me of news that was swirling in early 2016. I'm sure you remember this. There were several big banks, RBS was one, I think Morgan Stanley was another, they put out research notes in January, and they were basically urging their clients to sell stocks. They were saying, ""We see these cataclysmic issues coming to the market."" It was, again, largely due to quantitative easing stuff with the Fed, low interest rate environments, and what that does to equities over an extended period of time, or else some growth concerns with China at the time. And you look at the run that the market has gone on since January 2016, I think it's up about 20%.
","The Market Will Probably See a Correction, but Don't Bet on When"
http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/04/28/ask-a-fool-are-there-any-stocks-under-10-worth-buy.aspx,2017-04-28,"
Q: Are any stocks under $10 per share worth buying now?
First of all, it's important to point out that for the most part, a stock's price is an arbitrary number. Think of it this way: If Company A has 1,000,000 outstanding shares of stock that trade for $5, and Company B has 100,000 shares that each trade for $50, both companies are worth the exact same amount of $5 million.
Having said that, there are some advantages to lower-priced stocks. For one thing, you may be able to invest more of your money. As I write this, one share of Amazon.com trades for $938. If you have $1,500 to invest, you can only afford to buy one share of Amazon, leaving $562 of your money sitting on the sidelines. Lower-priced stocks also allow you to buy more shares, which is important if you like to use options strategies, as options trade in multiples of 100.
One sub-$10 stock I like right now is Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI), which was a recent addition to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The company has a dominant position in the subscription-based radio industry, strong revenue growth in recent years, and it produces excellent free cash flow.
Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) is another low-cost stock I have my eye on. There are certainly some challenges in the retail industry right now, but Staples is well-positioned to come out on top in the office superstore business. The company has a leading market share and a strong balance sheet, and is adapting well to the evolving retail environment. It also trades for an extremely low valuation of just 10.5 times forward earnings.

",Ask a Fool: Are There Any Stocks Under $10 Worth Buying?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/02/why-lumber-liquidators-holdings-archer-daniels-mid.aspx,2017-05-02,"
The stock market didn't make any major moves on Tuesday, and the Dow and S&P 500 both finished very close to where they started the day on a general lack of market-moving news. There was plenty of activity within as earnings season went through its quarterly crescendo, but the balance between winners and losers from financial reports was relatively even. Despite an increasingly favorable outlook among many investors about the state of the overall economy, some companies had bad news to report. Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL), Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM), and Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Lumber Liquidators loses big
Shares of Lumber Liquidators Holdings dropped 14% in the wake of the company's first-quarter financial results. The wood-flooring specialist said that it lost $0.93 per share, which was actually somewhat better than its results from the year-ago quarter but were still far worse than what investors were expecting to see. A 6% rise in revenue on comparable-store sales gains of 4.7% wasn't strong enough to convince investors that the retailer is on track for a full recovery from its controversy-laden plunge over the past few years. CEO Dennis Knowles, however, was pleased at the positive comps and believes that they're just the beginning of a longer-term rebound that could take the company back toward what it looked like during its heyday in the early 2010s.

ADM leaves shareholders hungry for more
Archer Daniels Midland stock fell 9% after the company warned that poor conditions in the agricultural markets could constrain its ability to produce profit growth going forward. Reported profits jumped by half from year-ago levels, as ADM made the most of a modest 4% rise in revenue. Yet in a conference call after the earnings release, CEO Juan Luciano said that there are extremely large stockpiles of foodstuffs across the globe, and that has made it difficult for ADM to make profitable moves internationally with its asset base. The company has already made a lot of progress with restructuring efforts to take greater advantage of available opportunities, but that could simply mean that ADM has already captured the low-hanging fruit, leaving it with bigger challenges ahead.

            });
        

Mosaic needs a growth boost
Finally, shares of Mosaic declined 7%. The fertilizer giant said that lower prices on potash and phosphate-based fertilizers led to a small net loss of $1 million, wiping out year-earlier earnings of $257 million. Net sales fell from year-ago levels, mostly because weak fertilizer commodities markets outweighed the greater volume demand from the buyers that Mosaic supplies. CEO Joc O'Rourke said that Mosaic anticipates better market conditions for potash and phosphates in the rest of 2017, and that could help boost earnings going forward. However, investors seem skeptical about the size of that potential growth, and until they see more tangible proof of a recovery in the fertilizer market, they appear content to leave Mosaic share prices at low levels.

In terms of great dividend stocks in the smartphone market, investors need look no further than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF).
As the perennial leaders in terms of devices shipped, these two fierce competitors stand head-and-shoulders above the competition -- so much so that Apple and Samsung typically capture more than 90% of all smartphone market profits in any given quarter. So let's dive into the income-investing thesis for each of these two smartphone giants.
Apple
At first glance, the Mac maker might seem like an underwhelming income investment. After all, its 1.5% dividend yield sits a cool 40 basis points lower than the S&P 500's 1.9% yield. However, this perspective dramatically understates Apple's potency as a long-term dividend growth stock.
The main source of the company's strength as an income investment comes from Apple's massive balance sheet. The company sported an otherworldly $158 billion in net cash -- cash and investments minus debt -- as of its January earnings release. And given the company's cash-generation capabilities, it only seems that Apple will have added to that figure during its most recent quarter, for which it will report earnings on May 2. The company is also widely expected to increase its dividend and further expand its capital-return program beyond its current $250 billion allocation as part of the report; be sure to check back at the Fool for analysis of Apple's report.
The source of Apple's capital return war chest is, of course, its various high-end consumer-electronics franchises, led by the iPhone. Here's a quick overview of how the iPhone has grown in prominence within Apple's financial empire in recent years.

If anything, this trend appears likely to continue during Apple's 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, as the effect of its highly anticipated iPhone 8 should draw more consumers into Apple's device ecosystem. According to Bank of Montreal research, 31% of the iPhone's installed base will be two years or older by the time Apple releases the iPhone 8 this fall, suggesting consumers should be primed to purchase Apple's newly redesigned handset en masse. For this reason and many more, the iPhone appears poised to become even more important to Apple's financial performance and dividend payments in the years to come.

Samsung
The only dividend-paying company positioned to challenge Apple in the smartphone arena, South Korean smartphone power Samsung also enjoys an interesting dividend growth story today.
After weathering a difficult past year -- largely because of its Galaxy Note 7 recall and its place in South Korea's ongoing political scandals -- Samsung has demonstrated that the worst is behind it in a number of ways. Its chip business, mobile unit, and television units all contributed strong performance during the company's most recent quarterly report, which saw the company remain on track to report record earnings for its entire fiscal 2017.

Samsung also made progress in placating longtime activist shareholder Elliott Management, which originally advanced a plan calling to split Samsung into two publicly traded companies. Samsung has rejected this idea outright, but it did report that it planned to cancel $35 billion in outstanding treasury stock, a financial engineering move that should boost earnings per share by reducing its number of shares outstanding.
Elliott also factors into Samsung's dividend outlook. Regardless of your opinion on activist investors, Elliott's campaign to boost shareholder returns forced the electronics giant to pledge to increase the amount of free cash flow it will distribute as dividends from around 30% to 50% this year. Especially considering the company's improving operation performance, it seems Samsung's current 1.6% yield  could increase meaningfully in the year ahead.
Like Apple, Samsung's dominant franchises across a wide spectrum of the electronics industry give it a strong base of profits from which it can continue to reward shareholders for years to come. At the end of the day, the race to find the best two dividend stocks in the smartphone market is a two-horse race between Apple and Samsung. 
",2 Top Dividend Stocks in Smartphones
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/10/better-buy-glaxosmithkline-plc-vs-johnson-johnson.aspx,2017-05-10,"
The stocks of big pharmaceutical companies are usually not very exciting, but that's just fine for savvy investors who value safe dividends and the fact that these stocks often outperform the market in downturns. GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are both diversified healthcare companies, and the one that's the best pick for you may depend on the kind of investor you are.
The case for GlaxoSmithKline
Glaxo's business has strengthened since the closure two years ago of an asset-swap deal with Novartis. Some observers were critical of the deal at the time, as the company traded its fast-growing and profitable oncology drugs for more pedestrian vaccine and consumer-goods assets.

Image source: Getty Images.

But the deal added stability and balance to the company, yielded $5 billion in annual cost savings, and left the company with cash proceeds of $16 billion to invest in new product development that has reinvigorated the pharma segment. Sales of drugs that have been developed in the most recent three or four years have increased from $687 million in Q2 of 2015 to $1.8 billion in the most recent quarter. Pharmaceutical sales in Q1 were 57% of the total, vaccines 16%, and consumer 28%.
All three business segments are contributing well, with each reporting positive growth for four consecutive quarters on a constant currency basis. Vaccines have been the growth leader recently, with a 12% increase in sales in 2016 and a 16% pop in Q1 of 2017. Overall, Glaxo was able to grow the top line by 6% and earnings per share by 12% last year.
This year will be a little bit more challenging, mainly because of the generic threat to its biggest drug, Advair. The respiratory drug sold $3.5 billion in 2016, but the company has said that if a generic shows up around mid-year, sales in the U.S. could be expected to drop by $1.2 billion. In that scenario, 2017 EPS could be flat to slightly down from 2016. Given Mylan's recent stumble in its attempt to win approval for its Advair generic, this is probably the worst case.
But outside of Advair, Glaxo's pharma business is quite healthy. Notable is the growth in its HIV drugs, which are giving Gilead Sciences a run for its money. The HIV portfolio grew 19% in constant currency last quarter to almost $1 billion. 
Meanwhile, Glaxo continues to pay a generous dividend that amounts to 4.9% at today's exchange rate. Improving free cash flow in recent quarters seems to indicate the company will have no problem paying its dividend going forward.
The case for Johnson & Johnson
Johnson & Johnson is already what GlaxoSmithKline has aspired to become: well balanced across multiple businesses and not as susceptible to the ups and downs of pharmaceutical sales. J&J's drug business comprises 45% of total sales, medical devices 32%, and consumer 20%.
J&J has been challenged to generate the growth that investors would like to see in recent years. Sales in 2016 increased 2.6% after declining 5.7% in 2015. But improving margin in the consumer business has helped prop up earnings gains, with adjusted EPS growing 9.7% last year. The overall business has generated plenty of cash, giving J&J the option to grow by acquisition.
And acquire it did, picking up Swiss pharmaceutical company Actelion in a $30 billion cash deal announced in January. Management expects the deal to add 1.5% to 2% to the company's long-term growth rate, and an additional $0.35 to $0.40 in earnings per share to 2018 results. The ability to do this kind of deal illustrates the advantages of the financial strength resulting from J&J's size and diverse revenue base.
Even without the Actelion transaction, Johnson & Johnson was expecting to see improving growth. The medical-devices unit made three smaller acquisitions, and the company projected organic sales growth in the 3% to 3.5% range. Guidance for adjusted earnings growth for 2017 excluding currency is 5.8% to 8%. 
But from an investor standpoint, the most appealing characteristic of Johnson & Johnson stock has long been the dividend. The company has raised its dividend annually for over 50 years, and over the past 10 years the payout has grown at a compounded annual rate of 9.4%. The current forward yield is 2.7%.
Even without gangbusters growth, the company has enriched its shareholders by delivering total returns of 10.5% annualized over 20 years, soundly beating the S&P 500's return of 7.7% over that period. The difference for a person who invested $10,000 in J&J 20 years ago and reinvested dividends would be a profit of $63,662 vs. $34,087 if invested in the index. Johnson & Johnson is the tortoise that wins a lot of races.

Better buy
I'm going to give a nuanced answer to this choice. For a conservative investor who wants to put money in an income stock, reinvest dividends, and forget about the investment for a decade or more, it would be hard to go wrong picking Johnson & Johnson. The company has demonstrated a commitment to shareholder returns and has the management, product portfolio, and financial strength to continue to deliver compounding, market-beating returns for a long time.
On the other hand, I think GlaxoSmithKline is likely to deliver a higher total return over the next five years. The yield of 4.9% is abnormally high, probably because the company doesn't have a long history of sufficient coverage of the dividend out of profits and cash flow to give investors confidence that it can be maintained for the long run.
I think it will be. Glaxo's restructuring efforts have paid off with a much stronger free cash flow, and as it becomes more evident, the stock will rise to bring the yield down to a level more consistent with its peers. A yield of 3.5%, for example, would imply a stock price of about $59 at the current dividend rate, about 41% above today's level.
Also, there is a good chance that Glaxo's growth over the next five years will exceed that of Johnson & Johnson. The threat to Advair is well priced into the stock at this point, and once that issue fades in the rearview mirror, growth in its other assets will take over and could even support a higher multiple.
Which stock is a better buy for you depends on your goals and temperament. Either one could potentially give you market-beating returns.

From generating income by selling covered calls, or hedging a stock before an earnings release, stock options add a whole new layer to the stock market. Perhaps more so than those who simply buy and sell stocks or funds, those who use options should be diligent in picking a broker for their options trades. 
Let's review what Fidelity has to offer in the world of options trading, from research capabilities to the guts of its commission prices.
Standard trading commissions
Fidelity uses the same commission structure as most online discount brokers. Options trades are priced on a base-plus commission schedule, wherein commissions vary with the number of options contracts.



Stock Options

Stocks and ETFs





$4.95 per trade + $0.65 per contract


$4.95 per trade




Data source: company website.
Of course, these are just standard published prices. In many cases, investors can qualify for special offers when they open a new brokerage account. 
Multi-leg options and exercise and assignment fees
Some option strategies require buying and selling multiple puts and calls to complete the trade. Fidelity charges one base rate on multi-leg orders, which means a client would pay just one $4.95 base rate to trade multiple puts and/or call contracts at different strike prices or expiration dates in one order.



Type of Transaction

Fees and Commissions





Multi-leg options


One base rate of $4.95 (up to four legs)




Options exercise


$4.95




Options assignment


$4.95




Buy to close fee for low-cost options


Free to close short options positions worth $0.10 or less, $4.95 flat to close short options positions worth $0.11 to $0.65. 




Data source: company website.
People who write covered calls or engage in other short options trades might like that Fidelity waives or significantly reduces the cost to buy to close short options positions where there is little remaining upside.
For example: A trader might sell calls to collect a premium of $1.00 per option. Over time, the trade goes his or her way, and the options now sell for just $0.05 each. In this scenario it may be advantageous to buy to close this position, keeping the $0.95 gain and leaving $0.05 per option contract on the table, as the small additional gain isn't worth the risk of potentially unlimited losses. For options valued at less than $0.05 each, Fidelity doesn't charge a commission to buy-to-cover. 

Free buy-to-cover transactions can be a big benefit for some options traders. Image source: Getty Images.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-67637');
            });
        

Options research tools
One great thing about online discount brokers is that customers often receive free research and other tools just for having an account.
Fidelity offers an options portal powered by Livevol, which allows customers to scan the market for contracts with high volume, changing implied volatility, and calls with the highest return potential in the S&P 500 (provided by S&P Capital IQ).
Minimum deposit requirements for options trading
Fidelity doesn't have a minimum deposit requirement for simple cash accounts enabled with options trading capabilities.
Of course, some strategies require larger deposits. Shorting options, for example, exposes the accountholder (and ultimately the brokerage) to unlimited risk and thus typically requires a higher equity balance. The amounts can vary based on the specific trade, however.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-21681');
            });
        

Fidelity as an options broker
Fidelity may attract the infrequent options trader for the fact it charges just one base commission on multi-leg options trades, and for its big discounts on trades where customers are buying to cover a short options position. Its low minimums may also be advantageous to those who want to build up their balance over time with a series of deposits.

""As most of you know, I've been racking my brain to make sense of this disconnect [about the stock price],"" said Blackstone L.P.'s (NYSE:BX) CEO Steve Schwartzman on last week's earnings call. ""If our shares were valued the same as the average S&P company based on dividend yield, the share price would be over $100 a share instead of the $30, where it now is. If we were valued using the average PE multiple, the price would be over $50. That's just math.""
Is Schwartzman correct?  Blackstone's earnings were certainly impressive. Let's go through the numbers and call to see if he's right.

source: Getty Images

(Almost) a record distribution
Blackstone had its second-highest quarter of distributable income ever this quarter, at $1.02, $0.87 of which will be distributed to unit-holders in May. . The record for distributable earnings occurred exactly two years ago in the first quarter of 2015.
The performance was due to almost $17 billion in realizations (asset or company sales), which netted Blackstone's general partner $1.2 billion in realized performance fees for the quarter. Adding to this was $291 million in fee-related earnings, which was up a whopping 18% year-over-year. 
The company took advantage of a rising stock market and real estate values to realize $6.2 billion from its private equity portfolio, as well as $6.7 billion from real estate, driven by the sale of 25% of Hilton, disposition of the Japan residential portfolio, and the completion of the Invitation Homes IPO (NYSE:INVH). 
Invitation Homes was constructed when Blackstone bought up thousands of homes across the country in the wake of the financial crisis. The company still owns 75% of Invitation Homes, with the IPO mostly going to pay down the Invitation Homes' debt, but the IPO will allow Blackstone to grow the platform and collect more in the way of rental income.
Fundraising and AUM
Despite the huge distribution, Blackstone was able to increase its total AUM 7% to $368 billion because of $14 billion of fund inflows and rising portfolio values across all four segments. Perhaps more importantly, fee-earning assets under management grew 15% to $280.2 million. The amount of money that the company has sitting in cash and ready to invest reached $94 billion, up 6% year over year. Blackstone refers to this as ""dry powder."" 
While Blackstone's realizations, and therefore, distributions, can vary depending on markets, future realizations can be anticipated by the growth in assets under management and inflows. This looks good as well.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-74920');
            });
        

New investments
Blackstone invested $11.7 billion in the first quarter, even with so many realizations. This shows the alternatives giant is still finding investing opportunities in certain pockets of the world while it harvests other investments with markets at all-time highs.
New investment highlights included the acquisition of Team Health, several energy investments (which I thought was quite interesting, as Blackstone seems to be making a call on oil, which is rare)) across the GSO Credit and Tactical Opportunities strategies, including the Eagle Claw midstream assets in the Permian Basin, European direct lending, and the stake in SESAC, a music rights company, which is part of Blackstone's new ""Warren Buffett,"" buy-and-hold strategy called Core Private Equity. 
Looking ahead
You may think with all of this action, the company would rest on its laurels as the largest alternative manager in the world. That is not the case. On the call, the company talked up an idea for an infrastructure fund it is working on, as well as a new venture capital-oriented strategy that CFO Michael Chae said they were ""extremely excited about.""
Moreover, COO Tony James reiterated Blackstone's desire to tap into the 401K market. Many retirement funds are prohibited from buying into private equity limited partnerships because they are illiquid, but James said that with America facing a retirement crisis (as people are living longer but not saving enough), people will need a higher return than the 2-4% they are currently earnings on their plans after fees. Therefore, it's possible fund managers and regulators may loosen the rules to invest in alternative assets. 
Given that Blackstone's private equity funds have returned more than 7% above the S&P 500 net of fees over the past 30 years, it certainly seems like an undertaking worth exploring, especially for the new business-friendly administration.

Takeaway
In contrast to the first quarter 2016, when bad markets reduced Blackstone's distribution to only $0.28 per share, this past quarter showed the market what Blackstone can do when markets are generally healthy. This year, unit-holders can expect a much greater distribution than the $1.52 last year, and probably something more like the $2.73 achieved in 2015. . If, however, markets turn bad, the company also has $94 billion in dry powder it can deploy to take advantage of the next down-cycle. On top of that, the company's new funds and ideas set the company up for future growth.
Schwartzman is justified in his frustration about the Mr. Market's nervousness about where we are in the cycle, but long-term investors shouldn't fret about the ups and downs in distributions, as the long-term picture looks for Blackstone remains bright.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/08/activision-blizzard-stock-up-over-300-in-5-years-w.aspx,2017-05-08,"
There have been few better investments over the last five years than owning shares in any of the three major U.S. video game companies -- Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Electronic Arts, and Take-Two Interactive. Activision stock in particular has returned nearly 350% over that period, compared to just a 70% gain for the S&P 500.
After such a bullish run, some of you may be wondering whether it's too late to take a position in the company. Let's take a look at where Activision Blizzard stood heading into 2012 to set the stage for what investors can expect in the next five years and beyond.
What happened over the past five years

In April 2012, Activision stock traded at a P/E ratio of about 14 times. The video game company had closed out 2011 with revenue of $4.8 billion and an operating margin of 30%, leaving investors with $0.93 per share on the bottom line.
The company had three notable franchises heading into the year: Call of Duty, Skylanders, and World of Warcraft. That May, Blizzard released Diablo 3 -- the No. 1 selling PC title of 2012. 
In the ensuing years, the company would go on to add Overwatch and Destiny to its franchise portfolio, along with top-grossing mobile games Candy Crush and Bubble Witch following its acquisition of King Digital Entertainment in early 2016.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-16828');
            });
        


Today, Activision Blizzard has a broad lineup of popular titles that gamers spent 43 billion hours playing in 2016 -- helping the company generate total revenue of $6.6 billion with an operating margin of 35%. Earnings per share more than doubled over the five-year period. The valuation went up as well, as its P/E expanded from 14 to 40 times earnings, meaning investors today are willing to pay far more than they did in 2012 for a piece of the company's growth and leadership within the gaming industry.

Data by YCharts.
What next?
Now a $40 billion company, I wouldn't expect the stock to generate another 300% return for investors by 2022. But these are major opportunities for Activision that will be help push the stock higher:

Expanding margins from growth in digital revenue: With 450 million players across its portfolio, Activision Blizzard has a massive customer base to offer additional content, driving higher digital revenue (accompanied by wider profit margins as well).
E-sports: Activision Blizzard is setting up Overwatch League to be a long-term profit generator for shareholders. The league is expected to commence in 2017, but investors will need to be patient, as it might take a while to earn a meaningful profit for the company. Five years should be plenty of time for management to get the league humming along.
Consumer products: Activision Blizzard has an opportunity to monetize its iconic characters across its numerous franchises with the recent hire of a toy-industry veteran to run a new Consumer Products Division.
Transformative acquisitions: CEO Bobby Kotick's compensation package incentivizes him to make at least one more big transaction in the next five years.

As much as the company has changed since 2012, you can bet Activision will evolve even further by 2022. Though its P/E multiple will not expand the same way it has over the previous five years, continued strength on the company's top and bottom lines should reward investors nonetheless.

Q: I'm trying to find stocks for my IRA. How can I find stocks I can buy and hold forever?
First, I never suggest simply buying a stock and completely forgetting about it for years. It's always a good practice to occasionally check how each company that you're invested in is doing. This can be the simple act of reading quarterly earnings and annual reports, but it's still important to know what's going on.
Having said that, there are some steps you can take to craft a portfolio of low-maintenance stocks.
A good first step is to apply what I call the ""50-year test."" Ask yourself if you're 100% certain if the company's business will still be around in 50 years. For example, I like to invest in the banking and real estate sectors in my IRA. People will always need safe places to put their money, as well as physical structures to live in and conduct business in. Will they always need, say, action cameras? Maybe, but maybe not -- at least not as we know them now.
Once you're certain the industry passes the 50-year test, try to identify a sustainable competitive advantage that will keep the company's market share intact for years to come. As one example from my own portfolio, Realty Income (NYSE:O), which invests in freestanding retail properties, has a lower cost of capital and greater financial flexibility than its peers.
Finally, it's also a smart idea to look at the company's track record of earnings growth. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but companies that have steadily grown for decades have better chances of doing the same in the future.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/03/1-top-cheap-stock-you-can-buy-right-now-that-pays.aspx,2017-05-03,"
The current bull market is getting long in the tooth -- it's in its eighth year -- which makes it challenging to find ""cheap stocks,"" which I'd define as stocks that sport one or more attractive valuation metrics relative to their current financial performance and long-term growth prospects.
Moreover, there are usually good reasons that many cheap stocks are cheap; typically, they're either widely considered to have very limited future growth potential, or they're quite risky for various reasons. 
One stock that fits the ""cheap"" -- or at least ""somewhat cheap"" -- bill, but isn't one of the troubled cheap stocks, is amusement park operator Cedar Fair (NYSE:FUN). Moreover, the stock pays a juicy 4.8% dividend, and has whipped the market over the long term, returning 355% over the 10-year period through April 28, versus the S&P 500's 98% return. 


Image source: Cedar Fair. 

Cedar Fair's business
Despite being one of the largest regional amusement park operators in the world and generating $1.3 billion in revenue in 2016, Cedar Fair seems to fly under many investors' radars. This is a fact that can make for a wonderful stock for the long term, since these types of stocks can remain relatively cheap, or at least not overvalued, because they're not as prone to short-term money pouring in.
In fact, other than folks who live in the Midwest -- where the company's flagship park, Cedar Point, is located -- and big amusement park aficionados, many North American consumers probably wouldn't recognize the company's name even if they've been to one of its 11 amusement parks, two outdoor water parks, one indoor water park, and/or stayed at one of its five hotels. That's because the company's parks sports various different names, rather than all being branded with the same one.
Cedar Fair's parks are located in Ohio, California, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Missouri, Michigan, and Toronto, Canada. Its four parks that generate the most revenue, and which are probably its most well-known ones, are Cedar Point, located on the the shore of Lake Erie in Ohio; Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California; Wonderland in Toronto; and Kings Island in Cincinnati. Additionally, the company operates the Gilroy Gardens park in California under a management contract. 
Amusement parks are an attractive space, largely because the barriers to entry are high (high initial construction cost, limited land availability in some regions, permitting issues). Moreover, companies eyeing entering the space or expanding aren't likely to sink huge amounts of money constructing a new park too close to an existing park because many local economies can't support more than one regional park. This is great news for Cedar Fair's well-established parks, as investors can probably count on direct competition remaining quite limited for many decades to come. 
Financials
Cedar Fair's financials over the last five years are just what investors like to see: revenue has increased, but earnings and free cash flow have increased even faster. Earnings increasing faster than revenue means that Cedar Fair's profit margin has been expanding. An expanding profit margin usually reflects good pricing power -- it's not surprising that the company wields solid pricing power, given the above discussion about direct competition in this space being limited.

Data by YCharts.
Cedar Fair's strong and dependable cash flow allows it to pay a generous dividend, which currently yields 4.8%. The company's structure as a master limited partnership (MLP), rather than a more typical corporation, is a contributing reason for its attractive dividend. Such a structure allows Cedar Fair to pay out the bulk of its earnings to its unitholders without first paying significant federal and state taxes. The company has paid a dividend for 30 consecutive years, and has hiked its dividend in each of the last five years. 




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-90585');
            });
        

Valuation
From an absolute valuation perspective, Cedar Fair's stock doesn't appear pricey or cheap. It's priced at 22.9 trailing-12-month earnings, 20.6 times trailing-12-month free cash flow, and 19.7 times forward earnings. 

Data by YCharts.
However, looking at valuation metrics alone without taking into consideration earnings growth is missing the boat, despite the fact that many financial writers seem overly enamored by the most common valuation metric, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.
Cedar Fair's stock looks quite attractive when we bring earnings growth into the valuation mix by looking at the PEG (P/E to trailing or future projected growth) metric. While various factors come into play, a rough rule of thumb is that a PEG of 1.0 implies that a stock is fairly valued. Cedar Fair's trailing PEG is a very attractive 0.39, though its forward PEG is a less attractive 1.25. However, the headliner attraction to me is that it sports a five-year PEG of 0.78, which means that it's somewhat undervalued based upon its projected EPS growth over the next five years. Wall Street analysts expect that Cedar Fair will grow EPS at a rather torrid average annual rate of 25.4% over this period.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/01/why-intra-cellular-therapies-wesco-aircraft-holdin.aspx,2017-05-01,"
Monday was a mixed day for the stock market, with strength in major technology stocks lifting the Nasdaq Composite to gains of nearly 0.75% even as the S&P 500 settled for smaller gains and the Dow posted modest losses. Earnings season continued to drive market sentiment, and the broader picture of economic prosperity kept many investors bullish even in the face of uncertainty about government policy going forward. Despite a generally positive tone, however, some stocks gave up ground today. Intra-Cellular Therapies (NASDAQ:ITCI), Wesco Aircraft Holdings (NYSE:WAIR), and Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Intra-Cellular takes a hit
Shares of Intra-Cellular Therapies fell 24% after the company released a corporate update on the status of its lumateperone treatment for schizophrenia. The biopharmaceutical company said that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had confirmed that the results of a study of lumateperone don't preclude Intra-Cellular from filing a new drug application for the drug. However, the FDA raised some questions with respect to certain toxicology studies of the drug, and the agency requested additional information to confirm that there's not a safety risk in using the drug. Investors weren't happy with that mixed outcome, even though Intra-Cellular still believes that it can submit the drug for approval by the middle of next year. With concerns that the market for schizophrenia treatments is already crowded, some believe that the delay could pose new problems for Intra-Cellular going forward.

Wesco loses altitude
Wesco Aircraft stock finished the day down 18% in the wake of announcements of management changes and preliminary financial information. Late Friday, the distributor of supply chain management solutions to the global aerospace industry said that CEO David Castagnola had retired from the company, and that Todd Renehan had taken over as new CEO going forward. Also, Wesco said that it anticipates sales of $364.6 million, with adjusted earnings likely to come in at $0.21 per share. Both figures were substantially below what investors had expected from Wesco, despite the fact that shareholders were already prepared to see a drop in year-over-year earnings and only flat top-line performance.

            });
        

Radius looks less healthy
Finally, shares of Radius Health dropped 10%. The biopharmaceutical company said that it posted a larger loss than most investors were expecting, with net losses of $56.9 million working out to $1.32 per share. Radius said that the roughly 40% increase in its losses came from rising overhead expenses, with declines in research and development spending only partially offsetting the higher costs elsewhere. That news outweighed the positive sentiment from a recent FDA decision to approve the company's Tymlos treatment for osteoporosis, which has the enviable status of being the first bond-building therapy to receive FDA approval in nearly 15 years. Shareholders appear to be focused on the short run right now, but if Tymlos takes off, today's drop could give way to bigger long-term gains in time.

In what's poised to be one of the highest-profile tech trends of the next several decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) comes with growth estimates ranging anywhere from bullish to borderline preposterous. Here's a smattering of IoT estimates from a quick search:

20 billion devices will be connected to the IoT by 2020, according to Gartner. 
Consultancy Bain & Co. believes IoT-related hardware, software, and solutions will produce over $450 billion in revenues by 2020.
General Electric estimates that IoT investments for industrial applications alone will total $60 trillion over the next 15 years.

Say what you will about some of these estimates, but the Internet of Things' long-term impact is undeniable, and investors are clamoring to identify the companies helping make the trend a reality. So let's examine the IoT investing theses for dividend stocks Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS).
Cisco Systems
Global router kingpin Cisco Systems has made waves with its bullish predictions for the IoT. The company claims the Internet of Things presents a $19 trillion -- with a ""t"" -- commercial opportunity over the next decade. With so much at stake, it should come as no surprise that Cisco itself is doing as much as possible to tap into this big-ticket trend.
The explosion of data that the IoT should produce aligns with Cisco's core networking business, so the company should enjoy something of a natural tailwind here. Better still, the company is also busying itself with bolt-on acquisitions that push it deeper into emerging IoT-related services, such as its early 2016 purchase of cloud-based IoT application platform Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion. 
Cisco also offers plenty to like as an income investment. The stock currently yields 3.4%, far better than the S&P 500's 1.9%.  And though we tend to prefer dividend stocks with long track records of dividend growth, Cisco has shown an impressive commitment to increasing its per-share payouts of late. The company has raised its dividend every year since it initiated its dividend policy in 2011; it already increased its divined by 12% in 2017 during its most recent earnings report, which, again, reiterates this IoT play's prospects as an income investment.

Skyworks Solutions
Chipmaker Skyworks Solutions has an even more limited dividend history than Cisco, but the company still offers a compelling mix of growth and income that should prove attractive to many tech investors.
Skyworks' M.O. can be best described as simplifying the complex. The company manufactures over 2,500 various types of semiconductors, which it sells to over 2,000 commercial customers worldwide. For the non-engineering crowd, the majority of its components help simplify the transmission and processing of data coming into and out of all manner of electronics, a strategy that has worked to great effect. Since 2012, Skyworks has grown sales from $1.5 billion to $3.2 billion, and its profits have surged from $202 million to $995 million over the same period. Better still, the coming data surge from the IoT will serve as a continued tailwind for Skyworks' various connectivity products, much in the same way as it will for Cisco.
A relative newcomer to dividend payments, Skyworks has done all the right things since it initiated its dividend in 2014. The company has raised its quarterly payouts from $0.11 per share in 2014 to $0.28 at present, increasing its per-share payouts each year along the way. Its shares are admittedly low-yield at just 1%, though. 
However, the company enjoys an extremely clean balance sheet, with over $1.3 billion in cash and no debt. Furthermore, the company generated an additional $1.2 billion in cash from operations over the past 12 months, and its 22.7% payout ratio affords plenty of room for the company to safely increase cash distributions. The company may not be an income-investing dynamo today, but Skyworks Solutions certainly offers investors interested in tapping into the long-term growth of the Internet of Things a potent mix of sales and income growth potential.

Under Armour loses money
Under Armour shares jumped 10% following quarterly results that showed the retailer continuing to struggle. Overall revenue rose just 7% as spiking demand in international markets, from which it gets a relative small portion of sales, was offset by a 1% drop domestically. Profitability slipped by 0.7 percentage points to 45% of sales as the sports apparel retailer relied on price cuts to sell slow-moving inventory. Under Armour also revealed that it  ramped up investments in its growth initiatives including e-commerce, footwear, and international expansion. The short-term hit from that spending left it with a slight net loss -- its first as a public company.
Yet executives said they were happy that operating trends met their targets. ""Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations,"" CEO Kevin Plank said in a press release, ""and we're off to a solid start in 2017.""
Under Armour is working to make improvements to its innovation and marketing processes that should better position its products at the high end of the market, where they'll be less exposed to retailer price cuts. While they make those changes, executives expect a weak, but profitable 2017. Under Armour affirmed its full-year outlook at calls for sales growth of between 11% and 12% as operating income weighs in at $320 million.

Netgear beats estimates
Networking hardware specialist Netgear fell 10% despite announcing surprisingly strong first-quarter numbers. Sales rose 4% to $324 million to outpace consensus estimates that were targeting just $309 million in revenue. Earnings edged past expectations as well, landing at $0.64 per share. Wall Street would have been satisfied with $0.62 per share.
The report wasn't all good news, though. Netgear's operating margin fell to 10% from 12% on weak service provider revenue, including in the company's growing Arlo camera segment.

Yet executives said they were confident that this division will soak up market share and power solid revenue gains ahead. ""We believe we can continue to outpace this fast-growing market with continued strong investment in R&D, channel and brand marketing,"" CEO Patrick Lo said in a press release.
Netgear's second-quarter forecast sees revenue improving to between $315 million and $330 million, which is slightly ahead of Wall Street's estimates. However, the company projected a further decline in profitability, anticipating that  operating margin will fall to between 8% and 9%, compared to the 11.6% margin it the company managed a year ago.  The forecast dip is likely due to plans for increased spending aimed at securing a stronger position in growth markets like security cameras. That's the right long-term move, but Wall Street nevertheless balked at the prospect of declining profitability in the nearer term.

Whether retirement is right around the corner or several decades away, it's never too early to begin planning for the future. Here are 10 game-changing moves it pays to make right away.
1. Get used to budgeting
Sticking to a budget is critical once you begin living off a fixed income in retirement, so the sooner you start, the better trained you'll be. But more so than that, following a budget can open the door to savings during your working years by showing you not only where your money goes, but where there might be room to cut costs.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

2. Get rid of costly credit card debt
There's a reason credit card debt has a tendency to spiral. For every single day you carry an outstanding balance, you'll accrue interest charges that quickly add up in a relatively short period of time. If you're walking around in debt, now's the time to work on paying it off -- before it wreaks havoc on your retirement budget.
If you're years away from retirement, the money you save on interest charges can go a long way toward building a nest egg instead. Imagine you're currently paying $400 a year in credit card interest. If you were to knock out your balance and put that cash into a retirement account instead, you'd have an extra $18,000 after 20 years, assuming an average annual 8% return on investment. Now that's a far better use for your money.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-70282');
            });
        

3. Work on paying off your mortgage
Housing is a major expense for seniors, and entering retirement mortgage-free can ease the burden tremendously. Unfortunately, it's becoming harder and harder for older Americans to shake their housing debt. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 30% of homeowners age 65 and over continue to owe money on their mortgages. If you eliminate that home loan by the time you retire, you'll have far more financial flexibility later in life.
4. Ramp up your retirement savings
The average IRA balance in the U.S. is $94,100, and the average 401(k) balance is $92,500. But while those might seem like impressive figures, given that Americans are living longer these days, saving either amount will probably leave you cash-strapped in retirement. In fact, even if you were to save as much as the average American in both types of account simultaneously, for a total of $186,600, you'd still have a hard time making ends meet as a senior. That's because over a 25-year retirement, $186,600 leaves you with just $622 per month in spending money. Throw in Social Security, which for the average recipient today equals $1,360 a month, and you're still looking at less than $2,000 to cover all of your monthly bills.
That's why it's so important to save as much as you can during your working years. If you're under 50, you can put up to $5,500 a year into an IRA and $18,000 a year into a 401(k). If you're 50 or older, you can make catch-up contributions that raise these annual totals to $6,500 and $24,000, respectively.
Even if you can't max out these limits, increasing your contributions can make a big difference in the long run. In fact, if you were to put just $100 more per month into either type of account for the next 10 years, you'd have an extra $17,400 for retirement, assuming an average annual 8% return on your money.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-73699');
            });
        

5. Take advantage of your company's 401(k) match
Though not all companies offer a 401(k), 92% of those who do provide one also match employee contributions to a certain degree. Yet an estimated 25% of workers whose companies offer this incentive don't put in enough of their own money to snag that match. In fact, the typical worker who passes up an employer match misses out on $1,336 a year in free money.
Worse yet, when you give up a company match, you don't just lose out on whatever principal amount your employer would've added to your retirement account; you also lose out on that money's growth potential. Over a 20-year period, missing out on $1,336 annually would actually leave you $61,000 poorer than necessary, assuming your portfolio otherwise generates an average annual 8% return on investment. While you may not manage to contribute enough to hit the annual limit for a 401(k), you should at least kick in enough to benefit from your employer's match in full.
6. Convert your traditional retirement account to a Roth
Many savers build their nest eggs with traditional IRAs, not Roth accounts, because they offer an immediate tax break for contributing. But while Roth IRA contributions aren't tax-deductible, the money you put into a Roth gets to grow completely tax-free, and when the time comes to withdraw money in retirement, your distributions are tax-free as well. Furthermore, unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs don't impose required minimum distributions starting at age 70 1/2, which means your money can benefit from tax-free growth throughout your lifetime.
If you already have money in a traditional IRA, you do have the option to roll it into a Roth. Doing so will trigger taxes on the amount you move over, but it might pay to get those taxes out of the way now, when we know what rates look like. Since there's no telling what the future has in store for tax rates, saving with a Roth IRA eliminates much of the potential risk involved.

                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-17215');
            });
        

7. Lower your investment fees
A recent NerdWallet study found that 92% of Americans have no idea how much money they lose to 401(k) fees. While it's pretty much impossible to avoid fees entirely when investing your retirement savings, you can lower those fees by sticking with low-cost investments -- namely, index funds, which simply seek to track the performance of existing indexes, like the S&P 500. The fees associated with index funds are considerably lower than those charged by actively managed mutual funds, yet index funds have also been steadily outperforming their actively managed counterparts over the past decade and change. If shifting your investments frees up $1,000 per year in fee-based savings, you'll be $30,000 richer in three decades' time.
8. Sign up for long-term care insurance
It's estimated that 70% of seniors 65 and older will need some type of long-term care in their lifetime. The sooner you sign up for long-term care insurance, the better your chances are of not just getting approved, but at a more favorable (read: less expensive) rate. The American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance reports that more than 50% of long-term care insurance applicants aged 50 to 59 qualify for discounts based on their health. That number drops, however, to 42% of applicants aged 60 to 69, and to 24% of applicants 70 to 79.
9. Create a will
You don't need to be rich or have a complicated estate to need a will, yet more Americans than not are missing this crucial document. According to Caring.com, 58% of Americans don't have a will, including 64% of adults with minor children. While you can create a basic will yourself online, it often pays to enlist the help of an attorney who can ensure that your last wishes are documented correctly.
10. Decide how you want to spend your time as a senior
Given the amount of free time you'll have in retirement, it's a good idea to put some thought into how you'll spend your days. Deciding, for instance, whether you wish to travel the globe versus enjoy low-cost activities closer to home can help you determine whether your retirement savings are on track. According to a Merrill Lynch study, 58% of retirees fail to budget for leisure activities as part of their retirement planning, but coming up with a game plan in advance can help ensure that your cash reserves align with your expectations.
The more thought you put into retirement during your working years, the happier you'll be when you move on to the next chapter of your life. Follow these tips, and you'll be in a much better position to enjoy retirement to the fullest.



",10 Smart Retirement Moves You Can Make Right Now
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/17/a-foolish-take-the-most-durable-trump-bump.aspx,2017-04-17,"
Stocks in multiple industries have shot up since Donald Trump won the presidential election on a pro-business agenda focused on corporate tax cuts and deregulation. Bank stocks have emerged as major beneficiaries, as have shares of for-profit education companies. Yet there's one sector that's benefited more than most: private prison stocks.
CoreCivic (NYSE:CXW) serves as a case in point. It's the largest operator of private prisons in the United States, owning or controlling 49 correctional and detention facilities and 25 residential reentry facilities, and managing an additional 11 government-owned correctional and detention facilities.
Since the beginning of November, shares of CoreCivic have gained 136%. And it isn't alone. The Geo Group (NYSE:GEO), another leading private prison operator, has seen its stock soar 103% over this same stretch. The S&P 500 is up only 10% since the election.

Stocks in other sectors have begun to give back some of their post-election gains as the challenge of getting Trump's campaign promises through Congress sinks in. In contrast, shares of private prisons have continued to be buoyed by the Justice Department's vow to crack down on crime and reduce federal oversight of state and local law enforcement agencies.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in February, ""If we take the right actions now, affirm good, effective, proven law enforcement techniques, we can avoid another surge in crime rates in America.""

No one in their right mind would ever put all of their eggs in one basket. But if forced to, I have no doubt about the company I would choose: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
I've felt this way for a long time: Back in May 2012, I called it ""my highest conviction stock in the market."" Since then, shares are up over 350% -- versus the S&P 500's return of just 76%. But I'm still confident in shares moving forward, which helps explain why I'm comfortable allowing the company to occupy 20% of my real-life holdings.

Relax, I'm not really putting all of my eggs into one basket. Image source: Pixabay.

That's because Amazon has the three most important things I look for in any investment: an effective barbell approach, skin in the game, and financial fortitude. As an aside, many of the ideas I'll be using for this evaluation come from Nassim Taleb's best-seller Antifragile, which I highly suggest to investors and non-investors alike.
What's a barbell approach?
A barbell approach is one in which a company has a strong and stable core business, but allows for small, risky, high-reward experiments that never have the potential to cause permanent damage if they don't work out.
Amazon is the poster child for this method. It started in books, moved to e-readers, then general merchandise, and now creates original content for Amazon Prime viewers and is a cloud-hosting giant.
The key to understanding the thread that weaves this all together is the company's mission statement from the get-go: ""to be the earth's most customer-centric company.""
Let's investigate how that approach plays out in the real world. The strong and stable core business is e-commerce in North America. The company has routinely increased its sales of media, electronics, and other merchandise in this category. At the same time, however, it has been willing to experiment on the risky side with bets that have ended up being quite lucrative. Management doesn't break everything out for us to see, but look at how international expansion and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have increased contributions from the ""risky"" side, while North American e-commerce has continued to produce.

Amazon's BarbellCreate column charts
I don't know how many possible futures Amazon might pursue, but I know one thing: there are still tons of industries ripe for disruption because their customer service is poor. As CEO Jeff Bezos recently put it, ""it's always Day 1 at Amazon"" -- and I have no doubt the company will make moves into those areas.
Skin in the game
As an investor, I want to know that the employees and managers that actually do the work are motivated by success, and have reason to avoid failure. While everyone can talk a good game, it's something different to have one's skin in the game.
With Amazon, management is clearly aligned with long-term shareholders. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns 16.9% of shares outstanding, with a total value of somewhere in the ballpark of $75 billion.
But it doesn't stop with Bezos. I also want to see that he has created a workplace where employees are happy to do their jobs. According to Glassdoor, Amazon -- while not tops in the industry -- is doing just fine.

Given this, I'm confident that those at the company have skin in the game, and are motivated enough to be nimble and grab opportunities that arise for improving customer service throughout the world.

Finally, though Bezos is famous for playing the long-game -- investing billions today for the hopes of even more profit tomorrow -- I am comforted by the company's balance sheet.

The bottom line, as far as I'm concerned, is that the company is healthy. If an economic downturn occurred tomorrow, Amazon would not only survive, but it would likely be able to capture more and more market share from rivals by pricing them down to the point where they would have to capitulate.
Combine these three things -- an effective barbell approach, management with skin in the game, and financial fortitude -- and I think you have a recipe for a company that could very well be one of the first to ever be valued at $1 trillion.

Financial stocks led all sectors in trading volume, and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) declined less than a tenth of a percent. Following two brutal daily declines to start the week, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:NUGT) benefited from a small uptick in gold prices and logged a 0.6% increase.
As for individual stocks, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) both enjoyed market-beating gains as investors reacted to fresh quarterly earnings reports.

Chipotle returns to growth
Chipotle shares rose 2.6% following a first-quarter report showing a recovery gaining steam for the burrito specialist. Comparable-store sales jumped nearly 18%, which helped overall revenue improve by 28% to $1.07 billion. Net income was $46 million compared to a $26 million loss a year ago.
Both of those figures look stronger in part because of an unusually weak prior-year period that included intense negative publicity following Chipotle's food-safety scare. Still, there were broad gains in several key operating metrics including customer traffic and average spending per customer despite higher menu prices. Decreased reliance on promotions combined with falling food costs to push restaurant-level operating margin up to 17.7% from 6.8% a year ago. ""2017 is off to a strong start,"" CEO Steve Ells said in a press release. ""[O]ur operations have improved every single month, which gives us confidence that we are on our way to achieve our mission,"" he continued.
Chipotle is still far from the 28.3% restaurant-level operating margin it enjoyed before the food safety scare sent customer traffic plummeting. In fact, increased food handling costs may mean it never hits that industry-thumping profitability level again. On the other hand, it appears customers are giving the fast-casual chain a shot at winning back their business, and Chipotle is capitalizing on the opportunity.

iRobot cleans up its outlook
iRobot stock jumped almost 16% after the robotic cleaning leader announced surprisingly strong quarterly earnings numbers. Revenue grew 34% in the U.S. consumer market that it dominates with its range of automated cleaning devices to help overall sales rise by 32%. Gross profit margin improved sharply as well, rising to 51.8% of sales from 47.4% a year ago.

Executives said they were surprised by the strength of demand across its geographic segments. ""Our first quarter results were outstanding,"" CEO Colin Angle said. ""We are off to a great start in 2017 and tracking well to our near and longer term plans.""
The robust sales pace convinced Angle and his team to raise both their top- and bottom-line forecasts for the year. They now see revenue climbing to between $780 million and $790 million from the prior projection of between $770 million and $785 million, which represents 19% annual growth at the midpoint. iRobot boosted its operating income target as well, and so Wall Street had to scramble to account for the improving sales and profit pictures by sending shares higher.
",What Happened in the Stock Market Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/26/3-top-cheap-stocks-to-buy-now.aspx,2017-04-26,"
With the current bull market entering its eighth year and the S&P 500 trading well above its historic average, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find and buy cheap stocks today -- challenging, but not impossible.
In fact, some of businesses' biggest names trade at significant discounts to the market, including companies like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK.B), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). As such, let's dive into what specifically makes these value stocks particularly intriguing investing opportunities today.
Berkshire Hathaway
A monument to the powers of savvy capital allocation, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has produced so impressive a track record of investment excellence that it may never be seen again. Since 1965, Berkshire shares have appreciated at an average annual rate of 20.1% per year, which translates to a 1,972,000% increase in value. 
Today, Berkshire also mirrors its octogenarian CEO in some respects. Like Buffett, Berkshire has grown mature, its days of torrent growth largely in its rear-view mirror. However, the company controls an enviable assortment of high-quality businesses that will continue to throw off substantial amounts of free cash. Though Buffet and his longtime business partner are irreplaceable, The Oracle of Omaha has cultivated a deep bench of managers that should be able to skillfully tend to the company's operational and investing needs. At just 16 times last year's earnings, Berkshire shares remain a highly attractive option amid a generally expensive market.
Cisco Systems
Like Berkshire, Silicon Valley stalwart Cisco Systems also trades hands at just 16 times earnings. Also like Berkshire, Cisco is a mature and hugely profitable, although Cisco's growth concerns are slightly more acute than Berkshire's.
Analysts see Cisco's sales declining 1.8% this year, and then increasing 2.3% in 2018, the net effect of which results in no change over this period. The company's recent second-quarter result certainly didn't offer much in the way of hope, either. Here's a quick snapshot of how some of Cisco's main financial drivers fared during this period.

Image source: Cisco Systems Investor Relations. 

Revenue trended downward, as analysts expected, and the company's guidance also called for a 2% sales decline in the current quarter. However, the $3.8 billion in operating cash flow indeed speaks to one area where I think Cisco is quite interesting as an investment.
As I detailed in another recent piece, Cisco has jumped headfirst into its newfound role as a dividend stock. The company's shares currently yield 3.2%, well above the S&P 500's 1.9% payout. Moreover, the company raised its dividend 11.5% as part of its recent earnings report, which gives the company an implied forward dividend yield of 3.6%. However, what I like most about Cisco as an income investment is the aggressive pace at which it has grown its payouts, which it has increased at an average annual rate of 27% per year since it initiated dividend payments in 2011. So, while Cisco's forward growth path isn't clear, the company can still drive returns via its aggressive capital return, especially when its dividends are reinvested.

            });
        

International Business Machines
IBM shares received a 6% haircut earlier this month, when the company's first-quarter earnings disappointed Wall Street. The IT giant beat profit expectations but saw its $18.2 billion in sales miss estimates by just $190 million. This marks the 20th straight quarter of declining revenue for Big Blue, which probably doesn't make for much of a selling point as far as IBM's bull thesis is concerned. However, the market's strongly negative reaction reiterates the disconnect between the Street's view on IBM and the reality that its long-term business overhaul continues to take shape.
For the quarter, revenue from IBM's strategic imperatives increased 12% year over year. Over the past 12 months, sales from IBM's next-generation businesses -- including cloud computing, cognitive solutions, security, etc. -- have growth to represent 42% of IBM's sales. Furthermore, the company reiterated its full-year earnings per share (EPS) and cash flow guidance, making the market's dour reaction to its earnings seem all the more overblown.
It's simply a given at this point that it will take years for IBM to fully realize its strategic overhaul. The evidence clearly shows that the company will be able to do so, which wasn't necessarily the case as recently as two years ago. The company's shares currently trade hands at 13 times earnings, half that of the wider market. Moreover, the company's impressive 3.2% dividend yield and strong track record of capital return should help compensate shareholders as IBM's revival continues to play out, making IBM an intriguing stock for income-oriented value investors today.

The S&P 500 has risen more than 105% over the last five years, if you account for dividend reinvestment. That's a big enough gain to turn a $10,000 investment into a cool $20,500. While that's a great five-year run, a handful of stocks have left the famous index in the dust over this same time period. 
Here's a closer look at three such stocks -- Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IONS), Teligent (NASDAQ:TLGT), and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) --  that are each up at least 500% over the last five years. 

Image source: Getty Images.
Ionis Pharmaceuticals: Up 632%
This biotech's claim to fame was developing an innovative process called antisense that it uses to develop drugs. Ionis' technology allows compounds to be created that target and bind to RNA, which is what pumps out the proteins that cause diseases. Ionis' drugs can be used to reduce the amount of troublesome protein that end up in the body, thereby helping to treat the underlying disease.
What's great about this technology is that Ionis can quickly churn out new drugs once a troublesome RNA target is identified. That has allowed the company to pack its pipeline full of dozens of drugs that are aimed a treating a wide range of diseases. That provides investors with multiple shots on goal.
Beyond the broad pipeline, Ionis has been such a terrific investment over the last few years thanks to its ability to make believers out of other big pharma companies. Currently, the company boasts partnerships with Biogen, GlaxoSmithKline, Bayer, AstraZeneca, Roche, and more. Better still, these partners have been willing to shower Ionis with huge up-front cash payments to get their hands on the company's technology, which has kept the company's cash burn rates quite low. 

Image source: Getty Images.
Looking ahead, Ionis is nearing the finish line with three new drugs. If it has regulatory success, it could put a permanent stop to the company's cash burn. That suggests there could be more share price appreciation coming in the years ahead.
Teligent: Up 547%
Teligent specializes in generic drug manufacturing, but with a twist. Instead of making copycat versions of top-selling small-molecule drugs, Teligent focuses exclusively on products from the topical, injectable, complex, and ophthalmic markets (think creams, lotions, and ointments). With each passing year, a number of new drugs in these categories lose patent protection, allowing Teligent to make a generic, send it in for FDA approval, and grab market share by selling it at a discount. 

Image source: Teligent.

The strategy has worked brilliantly. Teligent's sales have been rising rapidly over the last few years, taking shareholders on a profitable ride. The company's margins are also on the rise, which has allowed the company to finally become profitable. The odds look good that strong growth will continue from here, too. Teligent currently boasts 34 new products that are pending FDA approval, which management believes represent an addressable market opportunity of $1.6 billion. That's a massive opportunity for a company that's only expected to ring up $67 million in total sales this year.

            });
        

Dexcom: Up 689%
More than 29 million Americans were diagnosed with diabetes in 2012, and those numbers are steadily climbing higher with each passing year. This chronic disease disrupts the body's ability to properly maintain blood glucose levels, forcing patients to regularly monitor their levels with painful finger sticks. 
Roughly a decade ago, Dexcom launched an innovative medical device that allows for continuous-glucose-monitoring, making it far easier for people with diabetes to track their blood sugar levels in real time. The diabetes community has largely embraced the company's technology with open arms, allowing Dexcom's revenue -- and share price -- to grow rapidly. 

DXCM Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
With diabetes rates climbing around the world, Dexcom should have plenty of room left to grow in the years ahead. Now that the company's crazy valuation has become more reasonable, it might be a great time to give this company's stock a closer look.

",These 3 Stocks Are Up Over 500% Over the Last 5 Years
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/03/is-this-the-toughest-question-warren-buffett-can-e.aspx,2017-05-03,"
Warren Buffett is the most famous investor of all time, and his annual Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) shareholder meetings have attained legendary status for the sheer number of attendees and the candor with which Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger speak about the company and its future prospects. Every year, Buffett faces some tough questions, and this year, some believe the Oracle of Omaha's recent change of mind regarding airline stocks could prompt a controversial query.
But will an airline question really be the toughest one Buffett faces? As I see it, there are some even tougher potential questions.
Buffett, airlines, and customer service
Buffett has a long history of hating the airline industry as an investment. He has used it as an example of a business where competitive advantages are hard to come by, where low-cost rivals can disrupt the entire business, and where even good times don't necessarily translate to long-term profit potential. Yet that didn't stop him from doing an about-face on airlines, arguing that the industry had moved past what he called ""a bad 20th century"" and should be able to control capacity more effectively going forward. That prompted investments in American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and United Continental Holdings (NYSE:UAL).

Image source: The Motley Fool.

It's that last holding that could bring controversial questions this weekend. CNBC anchor and longtime Buffett interviewer Becky Quick told The Motley Fool's Chris Hill on the latest episode of Motley Fool Money that she intends to ask Buffett about his view on United Airlines' recent controversy and the implications it has for customer service in the industry and Buffett's investment going forward.
However, in my view, that's not likely to be an especially tough question for Buffett to answer. The Oracle of Omaha has done a good job of cautiously expressing his views on Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), another Berkshire holding recently plagued by scandal, saying the bank ""made a huge mistake"" by not responding more quickly to problems. Buffett hasn't changed his views on Wells Fargo, and he's unlikely to change his investing strategy with respect to United Continental.

3 tougher questions for Warren Buffett
There are some more difficult queries that shareholders should pose to the Berkshire Hathaway leader. Buffett will be able to answer them, but he probably won't enjoy doing it -- and the tough questions are often the ones that most need to be asked.
First, why haven't Berkshire's stock returns reflected the full book-value gains that the company has produced lately? Over the past 10 years, book value has climbed by a total of 145%, yet the share price of Berkshire stock is up only 122%. That difference isn't huge, and Buffett will simply say that Mr. Market isn't valuing Berkshire shares as fully as he might in the future. Nevertheless, with Buffett having used book value as a standard for making capital-allocation decisions in the past, this question could lead some to wonder whether stock buybacks could be on the horizon.
Second, will Berkshire make more large outright acquisitions? Lately, the Oracle of Omaha has contented himself with major investments in publicly traded companies; Berkshire's last major acquisition was the 2015 buyout of Precision Castparts. Speculation about future targets has ranged from insurers and other financial institutions to industrial companies of every kind, but for now, Buffett doesn't seem in a hurry to move forward.
Finally, in the context of Buffett's assertions that most investment managers can't add value over simply tracking a stock market index, isn't Berkshire's story itself a rebuttal to that philosophy? There's little question that on average, the higher fees investment managers charge take their toll on total returns. Yet Berkshire has outperformed the S&P 500 in terms of book value and market performance. Following Buffett's argument, some critics have questioned whether Buffett himself would chalk up his own success to blind luck. To be fair, Buffett has acknowledged that there are some smart investors who have the talent to outperform market benchmarks, but he's said that they're hard to identify in advance. The toughest question -- to which we'll never know the answer -- is this: If Buffett went back in time, would he have been able to identify his younger self as one of the few who could consistently outperform the stock market?

Warren Buffett will get plenty of questions this weekend, and many will be simple for him to answer. Having been at this for so long, Buffett is uniquely qualified to handle off-the-cuff questions with his trademark combination of down-home straight talk and well-earned authority. Whatever the questions are, those investors who listen to what Buffett has to say will definitely learn something new and valuable.

",Is This the Toughest Question Warren Buffett Can Expect This Weekend?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/07/nvidia-q1-earnings-on-tuesday-what-to-watch-when-t.aspx,2017-05-07,"
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reports its fiscal first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on Tuesday, May 9.
To say that the graphics and mobile computing specialist is going into its report on a strong note with expectations high is an understatement. In fiscal 2017, ended Jan. 29, NVIDIA's year-over-year revenue increased 38% to $6.91 billion, earnings per share based on generally accepted accounting principles soared 138% to $2.57, and adjusted EPS surged 83% to $3.06. 
Given this financial performance, it's not surprising that NVIDIA was the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 in 2016 with its 227% total return. While shares have taken a breather in 2017 -- they're down 2.7% -- they've still returned a whopping 194% for the one-year period through May 4, versus the broader market's 18.3%.
Let's take a look at expectations for NVIDIA and what investors should focus on in Tuesday's report.

NVIDIA guided for revenue of $1.90 billion, plus or minus 2%, so it's not surprising that the consensus estimate is very close to this number. The company, which doesn't provide earnings guidance, has been whipping Wall Street's EPS estimates: It beat estimates in all four quarters in fiscal 2017, with the past two beats being crushed by 46% and 19%, respectively. That doesn't necessarily mean another earnings beat is coming, but it seems more likely than not.  
Focus on gaming and data center
NVIDIA reports its results across two business segments -- its core graphics processing units (GPUs) and Tegra processors (which are used in things that are mobile) -- and also across its four main market platforms, which include computer gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. Both segments have been growing nicely, as have all four platforms.
Investors' main focus should be on gaming and data center, because these are the company's fastest-growing platforms. Moreover, they're also now the two largest platforms by quarterly revenue.

Recent results in gaming have been getting a big boost from NVIDIA's launch last May of its latest GPU architecture, Pascal. PC gamers have been upgrading their old GPUs to more powerful Pascal-based ones. The good news is there's plenty of room for this trend to continue, since we're in the fairly early stage of the upgrade cycle and more than 200 million gamers around the world use NVIDIA's GeForce gaming cards. On the last earnings call in February, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said that about two quarters of its total gamers had upgraded and that the entire upgrade cycle -- which was then about nine months old -- takes about three to four years. 
Management will probably give an update on the call as to the upgrade progress. Moreover, investors can probably expect some indication as to how well NVIDIA's GTX 1080 Ti card is selling. In March, the company launched this card, which it touts as its most powerful GeForce card ever. 
In addition to having gamers upgrade their cards, another growth driver for this platform is that the size of the gaming market itself is expanding, driven by factors such as e-gaming, CFO Colette Kress said on the last earnings call. 
As to competition in the high-end PC gaming market, Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, has previously confirmed that its Vega card, which it unveiled at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, will launch by the end of Q2, or the end of June. Investors will have to wait and see how much of a threat Vega presents to NVIDIA, which has the dominant position in discrete GPUs: It held a 70.5% share of the market in the (calendar) fourth quarter of 2016, well ahead of AMD's 29.5% share, according to Jon Peddie Research. 
Data center: Artificial intelligence-driven growth should continue for the fastest-growing platform  
Investors can count on continued amazing year-over-year growth in NVDIA's data-center platform. In fact, Kress said on the Q4 call that the company expected this platform to show sequential growth, so we should see revenue come in higher than Q4's $296 million. This is the only one of the four main platforms for which NVIDIA's management guided for sequential growth.

Management said on the Q4 call that growth is being driven by the rapid adoption of a GPU-powered deep-learning approach to artificial intelligence, the migration of companies to the cloud, high-performance computing, graphics virtualization, and the company's DGX AI supercomputing appliance.  Investors can probably expect the same growth drivers in the current quarter.
AI has the potential to be a humongous catalyst for growth for this platform.

Professional visualization: Steady as she goes?
The professional visualization platform targets designers, engineers, and artists. As with gaming, this platform should eventually get a nice boost from virtual reality and augmented reality, which are very nascent technologies but are widely expected to take off in the coming years.

Given the current growth dynamics in gaming and data center, NVIDIA doesn't need big growth in this platform to continue to post robust results. 
Automotive: A longer-term catalyst for growth 
NVIDIA's Tegra processors have been used to power automakers' infotainment and instrument clusters for some time. However, the auto platform's most powerful long-term catalyst for growth is the imminent arrival of fully autonomous vehicles, which is widely anticipated to occur within the next few years.
The company is already benefiting, as numerous top automakers are already using or recently announced they'll soon be adopting NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 AI-computing platform to power their partially autonomous vehicles. These include Tesla, Volvo, Audi, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, and others.

Q2 guidance
Investors can probably expect NVIDIA shares to react one way or the other if the company's Q2 revenue guidance is notably higher or lower than analysts' estimates. (NVIDIA doesn't provide earnings estimates.) For Q2, analysts are currently estimating that NVIDIA will earn $0.62 per share on revenue of $1.90 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 55% and 32.8%, respectively.  
                        
                    
                ",NVIDIA Q1 Earnings on Tuesday: What to Watch When the Hot Graphics-Chip Maker Reports
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/02/2-top-dividend-stocks-in-phablets.aspx,2017-05-02,"
Phablets -- smartphones with screens larger than 5.5 inches -- are perhaps the lone bright spot in an otherwise listless and maturing smartphone market. In fact, research firm IDC has estimated that phablet shipments grew 49% last year, compared with 2.5% growth for the broader smartphone market. 
Like the smartphone market itself, the phablet space is dominated by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), each of which offers a notable dividend. So let's delve deeper into why Apple and Samsung are the best dividend-paying phablet stocks to own today.
Apple
Apple didn't start the phablet craze, but the Mac maker has embraced the trend with open arms in recent years. Though it moved toward larger screen sizes with the iPhone 5, Apple didn't launch its first phablet until it rolled out the iPhone 6 Plus in 2015.
Over its past three device cycles, Apple has charged about $100 more for its entry-level 5.5-inch iPhones than for its 4.7-inch handset. However, estimates suggest that the larger screen and improved cameras associated with Apple's larger iPhones add only about $40 to the larger iPhone's bill of materials. Put another way, Apple makes more gross profit from each phablet it sells than it does on its regular iPhones. This trend seems likely to accelerate in the year ahead.
A persistent rumor surrounding Apple's coming iPhone 8 claims the company plans to significantly increase the price of its new phone, perhaps charging as much as $1,000, according to some sources. As a result, Morgan Stanley estimates that Apple will increase its iPhone average selling price from $695 in last year's Q4 to $753 for its fiscal year 2017. Keep in mind that the average Android handset retails at a far lower $254.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-54788');
            });
        


It is this pricing power that lets Apple remain a compelling option for dividend investors. Its 1.6% dividend yield  might appear a bit disappointing at first glance; the S&P 500 yields 1.9% in comparison. However, Apple's immense financial resources -- it carried $159 billion in net cash on its balance sheet last quarter -- give it almost unlimited flexibility to continue to reward shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company is due to raise its dividend as part of its Q2 earnings report on May 2, which will extend its streak of consecutive annual dividend increases since Apple started paying its dividend in 2012. 

Image source: Samsung 

Samsung
Samsung sells its phablets across a wider variety of price points than Apple, but it has employed many of the same strategies to make its mobile business into a profit center. 
As with iPhones, Samsung generates the bulk of its phone profits from sales of high-end smartphone franchises, such as its Galaxy and Note devices. With prices for the recent Galaxy S8 ($750) and S8+ ($850) starting at $100 more than the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Samsung will certainly derive meaningful profits from the sale of smartphones and phablets alike. In fact, Galaxy S8 and S8+ pre-orders increased 30% compared with the last year's Galaxy S-series, according to reports. Even after weathering last year's highly publicized recall of the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung appears to have regained its mojo as the leading supplier of high-end Android devices.
At 1.4%, Samsung shares with Apple a below-average dividend yield.  However, Samsung should also be viewed as a stock with considerable room for dividend growth in the year ahead. The company has publicly pledged to increase its dividend payouts from 30% of free cash flows it paid in 2015 to as high as 50%, in a bid to pacify activist shareholder Elliott Management.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-26731');
            });
        


As I have noted in recent articles, analysts generally expect Samsung's sales and profits to increase in 2017, which suggests its free cash flow will also rise. (Free cash flow estimates weren't available at the time of writing.) As such, like Apple, Samsung looks like a phablet stock deserving of income investors' attention today. 
",2 Top Dividend Stocks in Phablets
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/30/lithium-stocks-remained-hot-in-q1-heres-how-they-s.aspx,2017-04-30,"
Lithium stocks' returns in the first quarter of 2017 continued to be powerful. The three largest lithium players listed on a major U.S. stock exchange -- Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM), or SQM, and FMC Corp. (NYSE:FMC) -- returned an average of 22.2% in the quarter, which is equivalent to a scorching annual return of nearly 89%.
The S&P 500 returned a historically strong 6.1% in the first quarter, so the group likely got a boost from the strength of the broader market. However, we can attribute the bulk of the lithium stocks' robust performances to the continued strong market for lithium, which is largely being driven (pun intended) by demand for lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (EVs).
The chart below shows how the returns of this group -- all of which are specialty chemical companies which produce products other than lithium as well -- stacked up in the quarter:

Data by YCharts.
The major catalyst for stock movements in this group -- as with many groups or individual stocks -- in the first quarter of 2017 was naturally the reporting of fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results, so we're going to home in on our three major lithium companies' reported earnings. FMC, which took the gold in the quarter, had another huge catalyst, which we'll also explore.

An electric vehicle charging. Image source: FMC Corp.

FMC Corp: 23.4% return in Q1
FMC's Q4 revenue slid 4% year over year, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 14%, and EPS based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) came in at $0.12, versus a loss of $1.53 in the fourth quarter of 2015. FMC has been restructuring its business, and the adjusted EPS results exclude restructuring charges.
Revenue in FMC's lithium business increased just 1% to $70.6 million year over year, accounting for 8.2% of its total revenue of $865.6 million. Earnings in this business, however, soared more than 90% to $21.3 million, thanks to higher lithium prices. The lithium business' operating profit accounted for about 10.5% of total segment operating profit. 
For 2017, FMC guided for adjusted EPS growth in the range of 13.5% to 27.7%. 
FMC's stock soared at the very end of the quarter, as the chart above shows, as the market liked the news that the company was acquiring the portion of DuPont's crop protection business that the European Commission ruled it must divest in order to merge with Dow Chemical. In return, DuPont will get FMC's health and nutrition business and $1.2 billion in cash.
As for the bigger picture with FMC's stock: It's returned 72.2% over the one-year period through April 27, making it the best-performing of the three lithium stocks and far outpacing the S&P 500's 16.7% return. Along with its peers, it's underperformed the market over the five-year period, but it's left the market in the dust over the 10-year period, returning 319% vs. the market's 98.4%.  
Albemarle: 23.1% return in Q1
Albemarle's stock shot up nearly 10% after it released Q4 earnings in late February, as you can see in the top chart. The market reaction wasn't surprising -- not only did the world's largest supplier of lithium beat Wall Street's earnings estimate, it also guided for a rosier 2017 than analysts were expecting. Albemarle's Q4 revenue slipped 3.6% year over year, adjusted EPS declined 19%, and GAAP EPS surged 242%, due to the sale of its Chemetall business. The revenue decline was expected, as it was driven by divestitures.
Revenue in Albemarle's lithium business jumped nearly 50% year over year in the quarter to $208.2 million, accounting for nearly 30% of its total revenue of $696.7 million. This increase was driven by a combination of greater sales volume and higher prices. Growth in the lithium business' adjusted EBITDA leaped 56% to $89.1 million, accounting for 47.4% of overall adjusted EBITDA of $187.4 million. 
For 2017, Albemarle guided for adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 19%.
Albemarle's stock has returned 62% over the one-year period and 198% over the 10-year period through April 27.

            });
        

SQM: 20% return in Q1
SQM's revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 34.6% year over year and its earnings per American depository receipt (ADR) soared more than 82%. Underlying results were stronger than its earnings suggest since the company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to resolve civil and criminal cases related to the finding that the Chilean company violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The settlement negatively impacted SQM's quarterly net income by $30.5 million.
Revenue in SQM's lithium business rocketed 181% in the quarter to $176.8 million, accounting for 31.9% of its total revenue of $553.8 million. SQM doesn't provide quarterly segment gross profit numbers, but we know that its lithium business accounted for about 55% of the company's total gross profit in 2016. 
Analysts expect SQM's 2017 earnings to increase 38.7%. 
SQM's stock has returned 70.4% over the one-year period and 185% over the 10-year period through April 27.
Looking ahead
Lithium demand rose in 2016 while supplies were tight, which is why prices increased. This dynamic helped to power results for FMC, Albemarle, and SQM -- most especially the latter two companies, as lithium accounts for a relatively small percentage of FMC's total revenue and segment operating income. FMC's stock only ""won"" the quarter because of enthusiasm over the announced DuPont transactions. 
2016 was a Goldilocks year for lithium stocks. It's widely anticipated that lithium demand will continue to grow in 2017 and beyond. However, as SQM noted in its Q4 earnings release, it's ""anticipated that new supply will enter the market during the second half of 2017."" So, depending upon the strength of demand and the timing that the new projects come on line, it's possible that lithium prices could stabilize or even come down in late 2017 or 2018. 
The three big lithium players report Q1 2017 earnings in May, so investors should pay attention to what they share about lithium demand and supply in their earnings releases and conference calls. Investors should remember that none of the three big publicly traded lithium players are pure plays, so their stock price performances will be driven by their overall financial performances, not just the performance of their respective lithium businesses. 

",Lithium Stocks Averaged a Scorching Return of 22.2% in Q1 -- Heres How They Stacked Up 
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/25/how-to-choose-a-stock-a-step-by-step-guide.aspx,2017-04-25,"
So, you're a beginning investor, and you want to know how to pick a stock? 
Good news. Even an average stock-picker should get a return of around 9% a year, the market's historical average. Let's take a look at how you can find the best stock for you.
Step No. 1: Decide what your investing goals are
Different people invest for different reasons. Some are looking to build wealth for a life-changing event down the road, like retirement or a child's college fund. Others are looking for an income stream to provide spending money. Some want to speculate for a potential big gain, while others are just looking to preserve the money they already have.
Traditionally, the two opposite ends of the investing-style spectrum are growth and income. Chances are your own investing strategy will fall somewhere on this spectrum. Growth investors tend to target, high-priced stocks, with strong growth rates and lots of potential. Think Amazon.com or Facebook. Income investors, on the other hand, favor slower-growing, stable companies that pay dividends. Coca-Cola and McDonald's are good examples of top income stocks, often called blue chips.
Your investing goals will likely depend on your own life situation. If you're a young adult looking to save money for retirement or a down payment on your first home, a growth strategy will probably be a better fit. If you're a retiree looking for money to supplement your income, choosing reliable dividend stocks would be better for you.
Step No. 2: Learn some stock basics 
Investing in the stock market can be intimidating for new investors. The stock market is full of confusing jargon, and the risk of losing money is very real. But it's not as complicated as it may seem. You only need to know a few terms in order to get a basic understanding of any stock. Here are three you should know:

P/E ratio: The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the best indicator of how expensive a stock is. The actual price of a share, on the other hand, is relatively meaningless. The P/E is simply the price per share divided by earnings per share. It shows much investors are paying for a dollar of profits. Historically, the average P/E ratio is 15.7. Today, the S&P 500 P/E is 26.25. P/E ratios can range from none for companies without profits, to the triple digits for companies with slim profits and high prices, and single digits for companies in decline.


Revenue growth: Revenue is simply the total sales of a company in a given period. Wall Street demands that essentially every stock show revenue growth, or at least have a plan to do so in the near future. While profits are more important to investors, profit growth can be more volatile and is often influenced by one-time events, making them more difficult to parse on a quarterly basis. Profit growth can also come from cost-cutting, which is not always in the best interest of the company's long-term growth. Revenue growth, on the other hand, is more straightforward and consistent, and generally gives a clearer reading of a company's growth prospects.


Dividend yield: On financial news sites like Yahoo! Finance, annual dividend payouts are listed alongside percentages called dividend yields. The yield is the annual dividend payout divided by the stock price. It's the percentage of the stock's value that investors get paid back to them each year. The S&P 500's average dividend yield is 1.9%, while the best dividend-paying stocks pay 4% yields or higher. Note that most stocks pay out dividends on a quarterly basis, and many stocks don't pay dividends at all.





            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-5522');
            });
        

Step No. 3: Pick a sector
Beginning investors will be best off picking a stock in a sector they are familiar with. Love going to theme parks? Think about putting some coin into Disney. Have a medical background? Check out healthcare stocks. There are thousands of publicly traded stocks in the U.S. Narrowing them down based on your own interests or experience can make a complicated process much easier.
Familiarity alone isn't enough of a reason to buy a stock, but it can give you an edge over the pros, and it will make it easier, even enjoyable, to follow the stock. You need to understand the underlying business, after all, in order to make smart investments.
It's no surprise, for instance, that millennials recently flocked to Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) shares after its IPO, as young people are by far the biggest users of Snapchat and therefore have the best understanding of the product. That doesn't necessarily mean Snap will be a winning stock, but those investors should have a better sense of the company's progress and when to bail if, for example, the product falls out of fashion. 
My own best investment came when I bought shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) shortly after its IPO in 2006. As a college student in Colorado -- Chipotle's home state -- I had visited the chain several times, gaining a first-hand familiarity with it that many investors didn't have, and believed in its growth potential.
Famed fund manager Peter Lynch encouraged individual investors to ""buy what you know"" -- a good first step for beginning investors.
Step No. 4: Bring it all together
By now, you've decided what your investing goals are, learned the basic stock market fundamentals, and narrowed down your potential choices to a sector or group of stocks you're familiar with. Now it's time to pick one.
There are a number of factors to consider, such as potential growth and valuation (P/E ratio), but perhaps the most important question to ask yourself about a stock is whether it has a sustainable competitive advantage. Warren Buffett, Founder of Berkshire Hathaway and the world's most acclaimed investor, considers sustainable competitive advantage to be perhaps the most important criterion for choosing a stock. He looks for companies with powerful brands, a history of dominance, beloved products, and other factors that block out competition and allow a company to earn excess profits. Many of the companies I've listed above are considered to have sustainable competitive advantages, whether that's Amazon's Prime ecosystem, Facebook's network effects, or Buffett himself with Berkshire.
A sustainable competitive advantage will ensure that a company can continue growing and earning outsized profits, and stocks that have them will generally outperform over the long term.
Now, go off and do your homework -- but if you still feel overwhelmed you can always put your money in an index fund. No less than Buffett himself has argued for that strategy repeatedly, and even recommended his heirs put 90% of his estate into a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. 
But before you go and do that, go back to Step #1 first and make sure it's a good fit.

McDonald's improves on expanded all-day breakfast
McDonald's shares shot up 5.6% after the fast-food titan posted surprisingly strong first-quarter earnings results. Wall Street had expected the restaurant chain to announce a decline in sales since it was going up against a prior-year period that included the hit launch of all-day breakfast. Instead, McDonald's managed a 1.7% increase in the key U.S. market, which contributed to a 4% jump in global sales. Earnings also significantly outpaced estimates, rising 18% to $1.47 per share while consensus estimates were looking for just $1.33 per share of profit.
CEO Steve Easterbrook credited the company's aggressive turnaround plan for keeping operating results churning higher. ""There's a sense of urgency across the business as we take actions to retain existing customers, regain lapsed customers and convert casual customers to committed customers,"" he said in a press release. Specific moves that helped this quarter included the expansion of its all-day breakfast menu and new promotions around beverages and its core Big Mac product.

McDonald's rebound plan aims to win back customers it has lost to fast-casual rivals through menu upgrades like its recent move to switch to fresh beef in its Quarter Pounder preparation. Easterbrook and his team hope that changes like that will return the company to customer traffic growth in the U.S. following two years of painful declines, and its latest results suggest the plan could be working.

Express Scripts loses a big client
Express Scripts' stock plunged almost 11% after the pharmacy management specialist announced first-quarter results and detailed the potential shock to the business that would come from the loss of one of its biggest customers.
The quarterly numbers were solid, with revenue dipping 0.6% on a slight decline in claims as adjusted earnings jumped 9% to $1.33 per share. Express Scripts also boosted its full-year profit outlook to between $6.90 and $7.04 per share from the prior range of $6.82 to $7.02 per share.
However, the company warned that Anthem, one of its biggest clients, is preparing to move its business to another provider once its contract runs out in 2019 even though Express Scripts has offered $3 billion in price cuts to try to extend the deal. ""It is difficult for us to understand why Anthem has not recognized the potential value which would be brought forth by engaging in meaningful discussions regarding a mutually beneficial pricing arrangement for the remaining term of our contract and beyond,"" CEO Tim Wenthworth said.
Executives believe the company has solid long-term growth potential even without Anthem as a client, but there's no question that the move will cause a disruption in the business. Anthem was responsible for 17% of revenue last year and about 31% of total adjusted earnings. With partnership talks deteriorating between the two companies, Wall Street had to lower its growth expectations accordingly.
",What Happened in the Stock Market Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/02/7-things-you-didnt-know-about-aqua-america-inc.aspx,2017-05-02,"
The idea of investing in and improving America's aging infrastructure is all the rage these days. This will, naturally benefit a variety of companies, including Aqua America (NYSE:WTR). With increased infrastructure investment a very strong possibility, let's look at some things that help to provide a more complete view of the company.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. Getting water from the Keystone State
Aqua America's roots in Pennsylvania can be traced back to 1886, when a group of professors from Swathmore College were granted a charter to supply water to the residents of Springfield Township in Delaware County. Shortly, thereafter, they decided to incorporate the Springfield Water Company, which would eventually become Aqua America.
To this day, Pennsylvania remains a vital part of the company's operation. In fiscal 2016, the company's largest subsidiary, Aqua Pennsylvania, accounted for approximately 52% of Aqua America's operating revenue and 74% of its net income.
2. A rising tide
Since the company primarily operates in regulated markets -- the regulated segment accounted for 97.6% of revenue in fiscal 2016 -- it can't arbitrarily raise rates whenever it likes. As a result, the company relies heavily on growth through acquisition. For example, during the five-year period ended Dec. 31, 2016, Aqua America completed 84 acquisitions to expand its utility operations. For fiscal 2017, Aqua America has four pending acquisitions, which will add almost 9,000 customers.

            });
        

3. Keeping it clean
In addition to providing clean water to approximately 3 million customers, the company provides wastewater services. According to Aqua America, every day its 175 wastewater plants return more than 26 million gallons of wastewater to streams and river ""cleaner than it came out.""
Moreover, the company powers several facilities in various states with clean energy, including solar power. For example, at its Pickering Water Treatment Plant in Pennsylvania, Aqua America installed a 6.5-acre solar field, which will effect an annual reduction of about 2.3 million kilowatt-hours and energy savings of $207,000 per year.
4. Diving in to the dividend
One of the things that most attracts investors to water utility stocks is the dividend. Paying a consecutive quarterly dividend for more than 70 years, Aqua America has shown a strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders.

Raising its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 7.6% from 2006 through 2016, Aqua America has not jeopardized the company's financial health. From fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016, the company has averaged an annual payout ratio of 52.4%, according to Morningstar.
The stock's yield further illustrates the attractiveness of its dividend; currently, it has a dividend yield of 2.25% -- among the highest of its peers. By comparison, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK), the largest water utility by market cap, offers investors a yield of 1.87%.

5. Gas up
Looking to spread its water wings, Aqua America formed a joint venture in 2012 with Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P. to provide fresh water to natural gas producers drilling in the Marcellus Shale in north-central Pennsylvania. In fiscal 2016, the joint venture accounted for $976,000 in earnings.
In addition, Aqua Resources, a non-regulated subsidiary of Aqua America, operates five bulk water filling stations in northeastern and western Pennsylvania and one in Struthers, Ohio. From these stations, bulk water haulers fill up and transport the water to Marcellus Shale well drilling sites.
6. Riding a strong current
Aqua America's long-term investors have been rewarded handsomely. Over the past 10 years, the stock has generated a total return of approximately 138% -- handily beating the S&P 500, which has risen only about 60% during the same period.

7. More than just water
Aqua America's commitment to the environment transcends the return of treated wastewater to streams and rivers. Since 2005, the company has participated in TreeVitalize, a project that aims to restore tree cover to communities across Pennsylvania. According to the company, it has planted ""more than 43,658 trees for 277 projects, equal to 302 acres of trees.""

Anyway, I went out and bought thousands of dollars worth of mature clothes so I'd look like a person to be taken seriously, instead of a pretty little twit. -- Shelley Duvall 
One thing you can do with $1,000 right now is to buy a new wardrobe. It's not even as silly an idea as it may seem, if it will boost your professional image at work. But it's still only one of many excellent ways to spend $1,000. Here, for your consideration, are five smart things you can do with $1,000.

1. Pay down debt
According to the folks at WalletHub.com, credit card debt in America sat at $979 billion at the end of 2016 -- the highest point in about a decade -- and is likely to surpass $1 trillion in 2017. Between 2015 and 2016, average credit card debt per household rose 6%, to $8,377.
If you're carrying a significant amount of debt, one of the most useful things you can do with $1,000 is to pay it down, especially if it's high-interest rate debt such as that tied to credit cards. It's not unusual for credit cards to charge you 25% or more in annual interest, and it can sometimes be hard to just pay off the interest owed with such debt, when you also really need to pay down the principal.
Imagine, for example, that you owe that average of $8,377 and are being charged 25% interest. According to one of many available online calculators, if you can only swing monthly payments of $200, it will take you 101 months (that's 8.4 years) to pay off the debt -- and you will pay $11,650 in interest along the way, far more than you owed in the first place. Paying off debt as soon as possible is a financially smart thing to do.

2. Fund an emergency fund
An alarming number of Americans are just one financial emergency away from disaster. According to the folks at Bankrate, fully 28% of Americans have no emergency savings at all, while close to half of us haven't socked away enough to keep ourselves afloat for three months. That's a big problem, especially since most of us should have ready access to more like six to 12 months' worth of living expenses.
It's easy to assume that nothing bad will happen to us, but according to a 2015 report from the Pew Charitable Trusts, fully 60% of American households ""experienced a financial shock"" over the past year, with about a third of them experiencing two. The median cost of households' most expensive shock was $2,000, or about half a month of income. More than half of households had trouble making ends meet after experiencing their shock.
You don't want that to happen to you -- and it could, if you unexpectedly lose your job or have to stop working to care for someone or suffer a costly medical setback or are informed that your car needs a new transmission. Establish an emergency fund and keep it stocked. That $1,000 can be a good start -- or can bolster an insufficient fund.

3. Invest in stocks
If you're not carrying a lot of debt and have a flush emergency fund, consider investing that $1,000 instead of spending it. Sure, a single $1,000 investment won't provide for a comfortable retirement, but it can certainly help. That's especially true if you're still young. Check out how powerfully it might grow over various periods:

Investing in an inexpensive broad-market index fund such as one based on the S&P 500 will get you market-matching returns, which will be pretty good. It can be hard to beat that, but if you'd like to try, you might spend some or all of your money on one or more individual stocks. Focus on companies you believe will grow at an above-average rate over the coming decades. They won't always perform as hoped, but if you research your candidates well and then follow the progress of whatever companies you invest in, you stand a chance of outperformance. Here, for example, are some 15-year growth rates of a few familiar companies -- plus what they would have turned $1,000 into over that period:

4. Invest in yourself
Another great way to invest is in yourself. Shelley Duvall offered one example above, that of buying new clothes. You might also develop yourself professionally in other ways, though, such as by taking a course or seeking a new certification or maybe even learning a new language.
You can invest in yourself in ways that benefit not only your work life but your personal life, as well. For example, get fit and stay fit. You might spend the $1,000 on some time with a personal trainer or on a treadmill or on a gym membership. You might also spend the money on travel. Travel can seem like a luxury, and in some ways it is, but it's also immensely valuable -- especially when you travel abroad. Doing so exposes you to different cultures and broadens your perspective as you see different places and how people live there. Some studies even suggest that travel can boost your creativity.
This last invest-in-yourself suggestion may seem off, but if you're very unhappy with the state of your life right now, you might spend that $1,000 on counseling. Seeing a therapist might help you identify problematic issues and work toward resolving or improving them or simply dealing with them more effectively.

            });
        

5. Give it away
Finally, even if you're not exactly where you want to be in life and could really use a $1,000 widescreen TV or a fancier bicycle, consider giving the money away instead. We tend not to think too much about the fact that billions of people around the world, including millions in the U.S., are trying to live on just a few dollars per day. A $1,000 gift could go a long way toward helping those less fortunate than yourself. It could, via Heifer.org, give four water buffalos to needy families who could use them and possibly lift themselves out of hunger and poverty with them. It could, alternatively, give 50 needy families flocks of ducks or chicks or geese that could help sustain them for a long period. It could, via DonorsChoose.org, provide needed resources for 20 or more public school classrooms. Through FeedingAmerica.org, $1,000 could provide 11,000 meals to people facing hunger. Through Ashoka.org, it could help support a social entrepreneur working to tackle a big issue (such as human rights, the environment, hunger, poverty, education, crime, or health) in an innovative way. Remember, too, that charitable donations can result in welcome tax deductions.
With a little thought, you may be able to spend your $1,000 in a much more productive way than you originally planned to -- while greatly benefiting others as well.

","5 Smart Things You Can Do With $1,000 Right Now "
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/05/a-strong-case-for-buying-celgene.aspx,2017-05-05,"
The pharmaceutical industry can present a growth investor with a dilemma: Should I settle for the slow growth of the big drug companies to get safety, or should I accept the risks of smaller biotechs to get the growth? Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) offers something in between with the best of both worlds.
Strong growth from the current portfolio 
Celgene's revenue of $11.7 billion in the last 12 months is plenty hefty, and the company turns about $0.31 of every revenue dollar into free cash flow. That alone makes the stock less risky than many small biotechs, but what investors should really love is the growth the company's drug portfolio generates -- a 22% increase in sales in 2016.

Image source: Pixabay.

The drugs in Celgene's portfolio are still early in their patented life and promise to keep the growth coming in the next few years. The company's biggest drug, Revlimid, accounts for 64% of total sales. Such a reliance on a single drug could be cause for investor concern, but in this case, it's feeding the growth of the business. Celgene is pursuing new indications for the blood cancer treatment, having recently been granted FDA approval for its use as a maintenance therapy for multiple myeloma after stem cell transplants. Also fueling growth is the fact that treatment durations with Revlimid are lengthening. Management expects sales in 2017 to be over $8 billion, a 17% increase over 2016, and analysts expect Revlimid to be the No. 2 oncology drug worldwide by 2022, with annual sales of $13 billion.
Revlimid is not the only source of growth in the portfolio. Two other drugs exceeded $1 billion in sales for the first time in 2016, and both are expected to hit $1.6 billion this year.
One issue most big drug companies have but Celgene doesn't is a threat from generic drugs. None of its four biggest drugs, representing 92% of 2016 sales, have patents expiring until 2023.
A robust pipeline
There's enough potential in Celgene's approved drugs to keep growth healthy for the next few years, but the development pipeline is loaded, too. The company has 30 unique molecules in development. Of those, 14 could make it to the market in the next five years, and management thinks 10 of those could peak at over $1 billion in annual sales.
The pipeline drug management is most excited about is ozanimod. One indication for it is multiple sclerosis, where it has an improved safety profile over Novartis' Gilenya, with annual sales of over $3 billion. However, the company thinks the biggest opportunity for it will be in ulcerative colitis, and it expects peak annual sales of $4 billion to $6 billion. Ozanimod could launch in 2018.
Besides fueling growth five to 10 years into the future, Celgene's pipeline will also supply a stream of news from human trials that could propel the stock in the short term. It's likely not all results will be positive, but there are 19 phase 3 trials reading out through 2018, so there's plenty of potential for near-term catalysts.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-24991');
            });
        

The wherewithal to grow the pipeline
The pipeline as we see it today doesn't tell the whole story of the company's potential. Celgene's financial strength will allow it to build its pipeline through research, acquisitions, and partnerships. The company filed eight investigational new drug (IND) applications in 2016, and 13 new programs are expected to advance to proof of concept through 2018.
Celgene management expects to generate a staggering $100 billion in free cash flow in the next eight years. Based on history, investors can expect a good portion of that to be invested in acquiring new assets for the pipeline, extending growth potential long into the future. The company's COO was confident enough that she recently said she thought the company would grow every year through 2030.
The best of both worlds
Celgene offers investors the possibility of appealing growth over a long time horizon with bets spread out over many molecules and trials. Company officials predict revenue of over $21 billion in 2020, which would amount to a 17% compound annual growth rate from 2016. But healthy growth should be sustainable for well into the next decade. With a price-to-earnings ratio of only 17 times guidance for 2017 EPS -- less than the forward P/E of the S&P 500 -- the stock is a bargain. Financial strength like big pharma and growth like a biotech make Celgene a rare find in pharmaceuticals and a worthy consideration for growth portfolios.

What's the best way to pick a dividend stock?
There are several approaches, and the best one for you will depend on your investing needs and risk profile. Most investors tend to evaluate the dividend yield first: the annual dividend divided by the share price. In today's market, with dividend payers in the S&P 500 averaging a yield of 1.9%, even a yield above 4% will catch the dividend investor's eye.
Dividend growth is also worth considering. While some Dividend Aristocrats -- stocks that have raised their payouts annually for at least 25 years in a row -- offer attractive yields and have solid track records, their growth rate may just be in the low single digits, which can be a problem for long-term investors. That's why it's important to consider the both growth rate and dividend payout ratio.

Image source: Getty Images.

Finally, there are special situations like Costco Wholesale, which just offered a $7-a-share special dividend, its third such payout since 2012.
But long-term investors who are saving for retirement, a child's college fund, or even to pass assets down to their descendants will want to consider dividend growth above all else. Below are two rock-solid companies with fast-growing payouts that are likely to be dividend powerhouses decades from now.

Image source: Starbucks.

1. Starbucks Corp.
In the span of one generation, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has gone from  a small coffee chain to the second-biggest restaurant company in the world, behind McDonald's. Plenty of jokes have been made over the years about the company's ubiquity, but it continues to expand aggressively, adding more than 2,000 stores last year to top 25,000 worldwide.
Starbucks began paying a dividend in 2010, and has raised it by more than 20% each year since. During that time, the quarterly dividend has quintupled on a split-adjusted basis, rising from $0.10 to $0.25. (Shares split 2:1 in Q2 2015.) Today, the coffee chain offers a yield of 1.6%. As the chart below shows, earnings have mostly kept pace with the dividend payout, a good sign for its future dividend growth.

SBUX Dividend data by YCharts
With a payout ratio of 51%, Starbucks still has considerable room to raise its dividend without an equivalent increase an earnings, but the dividend growth rates is likely to slip below 20% in a few years. Still, the long-term growth opportunities for the company in China, brand premiumization through the Reserve stores, and areas like mobile ordering and delivery should continue driving growth for Starbucks, and funding dividend increases at least above 10%. Most Dividend Aristocrats, by comparison, offer dividend growth in just the single-digit percentages.

            });
        



Image source: Nike.

2. Nike Inc.
Like Starbucks, Nike(NYSE:NKE) dominates its industry, and has crushed the market over the long term. With its brand and distribution advantages, and its leadership in athletic footwear, Nike is likely to continue to outperform the market.
The Air Jordan-maker has been paying a dividend since the 1980s and has raised its payout every year since 2004, with increases of 12.5% or more since the Great Recession. At 1.3%, the yield today is relatively meager, but Nike has more than made up for it in earnings growth. As the chart below shows, over the last five years, the dividend payout and EPS growth have kept pace with each other, as both have doubled. 

NKE Dividend data by YCharts
Nike has historically kept its payout ratio low; it's currently around 30%. I'd expect the company to maintain it at that level as it invests in R&D and expansion. That means that its yield will remain modest, but as earnings grow, so will the dividend, and the company should be able to continue its pattern of double-digit percentage increases.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-7975');
            });
        


Both Starbucks and Nike have set bold revenue targets. Starbucks appears to be well on its way to hitting its goal of $30 billion in revenue in 2020, and predicts EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20% over the next five years. Nike, meanwhile, is eyeing $50 billion in revenue by 2020 with EPS growth in the mid-teens.  Both companies have knocked down such goals in the past, and should be able to do so again. As they continue to grow, those dividend increases will set up long-term investors to reap handsome rewards.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/25/the-long-term-trend-that-makes-cvs-health-an-aweso.aspx,2017-04-25,"
Buy-and-hold investing works best when a long-term trend is working in a company's favor and better yet when the stock is being held back by temporary circumstances. I believe that's the exact situation with CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) today, which is why I think this is a terrific stock for patient investors to consider buying.

Image source: CVS Health.

The business
CVS Health is best known as a retail pharmacy chain, but the company is really two distinct business units that operate under a single roof.
First, CVS owns more than 9,700 retail pharmacy stores that are spread throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico (and Brazil, too). Beyond selling basic convenience items and offering pharmacy services, CVS also operates the nation's largest chain of in-store clinics. These MinuteClinic provide patients with quick and low-cost access to a slew of basic medical services. MinuteClinics have proven to be a big hit with consumers, and they help keep CVS Health's stores top of mind whenever a minor illness strikes. 
Second, CVS also runs one of the largest pharmacy benefits management (PBM) businesses in the country. PBMs act as middlemen between providers of healthcare benefits -- think employers, unions, governments -- and drug manufacturers. CVS uses its immense buying power to negotiate hefty discounts on drugs and then passes along the savings to customers. CVS also manages the process for its customers and takes a small fee for its service.
When combined, these businesses helped CVS ring up more than $177 billion in total revenue and more than $8 billion in free cash flow in 2016. 
The tailwind

According to census.gov, between 2012 and 2050, the U.S. is going to see considerable growth in the number of citizens aged 65 and over. As of 2012, there were slightly more than 43 million Americans that fit into this age cohort. However, this figure is projected to eclipse 83 million by 2050, which represents a near double. 

Image source: Census.gov.

That growth rate promises to be a huge tailwind to the entire healthcare industry since there is a direct correlation between age and spending on healthcare. In 2010, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services showed that per-capita spending for adult females and males between age 19 and 64 was $6,892 and $5,353, respectively. However, these figures nearly tripled to $19,110 and $17,530 for females and males who are over age 65.
The combination of an ever-growing pool of patients in need of care and higher spending per person promises to be a boon to CVS Health's long-term growth trajectory.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-96828');
            });
        

The (temporary?) headwind

Given the above figures, you might naturally assume that CVS Health would trade at a big premium to the S&P 500 in general. After all, not every business in the index can claim such a massive trend working in its favor.
Unfortunately, CVS Health's investors haven't been treated well over the past year at all. The company's stock has actually plunged more than 22%, which badly lags the performance of both the S&P 500 and the company's arch rival, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA).

CVS data by YCharts.
What gives? You can blame the downfall on the loss of two major pharmacy accounts in 2016. Last year, CVS let investors know that Walgreens Boots Alliance managed to steal away Tricare and Prime Therapeutics as customers. The move is expected to transfer roughly 40 million prescriptions from CVS Health to Walgreens in 2017, which is a substantial volume hit. In response, CVS Health's management team projected that adjusted earnings per share in 2017 were going to be flat.
The news spooked investors, leaving us where we are today.
A tempting valuation
While the customer deflection was most certainly bummer news, CEO Larry Merlo still believes the company is capable of producing double-digit profit growth over the long term. How? He laid out a four-point plan that includes new product launches, cost-cutting, partnering with other PBMs and health plans, and using excess capital for M&A and share repurchases. 
For what it's worth, Wall Street appears to agree that the company's long-term growth trajectory is still intact. Right now, analysts are projecting that CVS Health's profits will grow by more than 11% annually over the next five years.
And yet, despite all of the above, CVS Health's stock can currently be purchased for less than 13 times forward earnings! Mix in a growing dividend that currently yields 2.5%, and I think CVS Health could be a great place to put capital in today's overheated market.

Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency on promises to lower drug prices. Yet biotech stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 since his move into the White House, and some biotech stocks have more than doubled since his inauguration on Jan. 20. Among the best performing of these biotech stocks are Esperion Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ESPR), TG Therapeutics (NASDAQ:TGTX), and Aurinia Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AUPH), so let's learn more about them.
No. 1: Esperion Therapeutics -- up 223%
Roger Newton led the team responsible for developing Lipitor, the best-selling cholesterol drug of all time. Newton has assembled a team at Esperion Therapeutics that's working on what could turn out to be another top-selling medicine.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Esperion is working on bempedoic acid, an oral drug that can be taken alongside statins like Lipitor to lower bad cholesterol levels in patients who don't respond adequately to statins. In mid-stage clinical trials, combining bempedoic acid with statins lowered bad cholesterol levels by about an additional 20%.
The company has reported two important pieces of information that are exciting investors this year.
First, Esperion Therapeutics reported that it has fully enrolled patients in a phase 3 trial, and that data from that trial should be available next year. Second, the company said that the FDA has confirmed this trial can support an approval of bempedoic acid, removing any lingering doubt that the FDA would wait to see results from a separate cardiovascular outcomes trial before considering it for approval.
Because heart disease is the second most common cause of death, and studies show lowering bad cholesterol can reduce major cardiovascular events, this medicine could be a big hit. Tens of millions of patients are prescribed statins annually, and millions of them aren't reaching their cholesterol targets.
Only time will tell if bempedoic acid's trials confirm its efficacy and safety, but the potential for use in so many patients was more than enough good news to send this company's shares flying. 
No. 2: Aurinia Pharmaceuticals -- up 177%
There are about 500,000 patients in the U.S. with systemic lupus erythematosus, and up to 60% of them suffer from lupus nephritis (LN), an inflammation of the kidneys that can cause end-stage renal failure.
Currently, patients with LN are treated off-label with CellCept, a medicine that delivers mixed response rates in patients.
In March, Aurinia Pharmaceuticals reported that using voclosporin and CellCept together resulted in complete remission rates of between 40% to 49% in LN patients, depending on dosage. The complete remission rate in patients receiving CellCept plus a placebo was only 24%. 
Aurinia Pharmaceuticals announced in April that it will conduct a single phase 3 study to confirm these results, and if this global, 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is successful, it will support regulatory filings for approval in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. 
CellCept's lackluster efficacy suggests that approvals could turn voclosporin into a big commercial success, and that's got some industry watchers thinking this drug could eventually rack up sales of $1 billion annually. While that's certainly possible, investors might want to temper a little of their enthusiasm. After all, there's no guarantee that Aurinia Pharmaceuticals' phase 3 trial will pan out.

            });
        

No. 3: TG Therapeutics -- up 163%
TG Therapeutics shares have been on a tear since management announced in March that its experimental drug TG-1101, or ublituximab, could reshape how doctors treat leukemia.
A phase 3 trial evaluating TG-1101 in combination with AbbVie's billion-dollar blockbuster blood cancer drug Imbruvica showed that 80% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and high-risk gene mutations responded to treatment. For comparison, only 47% of patients had an overall response to Imbruvica alone.
Management plans to share more complete data in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in early June. Shortly thereafter, it plans on discussing its chances for an accelerated filing for TG-1101's approval with the FDA.
TG Therapeutics is also studying TG-1101 in multiple sclerosis, and it plans to begin a phase 3 trial of it in that indication this year. Additionally, the company is developing TGR-1202, and an abstract regarding its use with TG-1101 and Imbruvica is planned for ASCO too.
With so much going on at this company, it's easy to see why investors have looked beyond the potential negative impact of changes in Washington and driven the company's share price higher.

Anyway, I went out and bought thousands of dollars worth of mature clothes so I'd look like a person to be taken seriously, instead of a pretty little twit. -- Shelley Duvall 
One thing you can do with $1,000 right now is to buy a new wardrobe. It's not even as silly an idea as it may seem, if it will boost your professional image at work. But it's still only one of many excellent ways to spend $1,000. Here, for your consideration, are five smart things you can do with $1,000.

1. Pay down debt
According to the folks at WalletHub.com, credit card debt in America sat at $979 billion at the end of 2016 -- the highest point in about a decade -- and is likely to surpass $1 trillion in 2017. Between 2015 and 2016, average credit card debt per household rose 6%, to $8,377.
If you're carrying a significant amount of debt, one of the most useful things you can do with $1,000 is to pay it down, especially if it's high-interest rate debt such as that tied to credit cards. It's not unusual for credit cards to charge you 25% or more in annual interest, and it can sometimes be hard to just pay off the interest owed with such debt, when you also really need to pay down the principal.
Imagine, for example, that you owe that average of $8,377 and are being charged 25% interest. According to one of many available online calculators, if you can only swing monthly payments of $200, it will take you 101 months (that's 8.4 years) to pay off the debt -- and you will pay $11,650 in interest along the way, far more than you owed in the first place. Paying off debt as soon as possible is a financially smart thing to do.

2. Fund an emergency fund
An alarming number of Americans are just one financial emergency away from disaster. According to the folks at Bankrate, fully 28% of Americans have no emergency savings at all, while close to half of us haven't socked away enough to keep ourselves afloat for three months. That's a big problem, especially since most of us should have ready access to more like six to 12 months' worth of living expenses.
It's easy to assume that nothing bad will happen to us, but according to a 2015 report from the Pew Charitable Trusts, fully 60% of American households ""experienced a financial shock"" over the past year, with about a third of them experiencing two. The median cost of households' most expensive shock was $2,000, or about half a month of income. More than half of households had trouble making ends meet after experiencing their shock.
You don't want that to happen to you -- and it could, if you unexpectedly lose your job or have to stop working to care for someone or suffer a costly medical setback or are informed that your car needs a new transmission. Establish an emergency fund and keep it stocked. That $1,000 can be a good start -- or can bolster an insufficient fund.

            });
        

3. Invest in stocks
If you're not carrying a lot of debt and have a flush emergency fund, consider investing that $1,000 instead of spending it. Sure, a single $1,000 investment won't provide for a comfortable retirement, but it can certainly help. That's especially true if you're still young. Check out how powerfully it might grow over various periods:

Investing in an inexpensive broad-market index fund such as one based on the S&P 500 will get you market-matching returns, which will be pretty good. It can be hard to beat that, but if you'd like to try, you might spend some or all of your money on one or more individual stocks. Focus on companies you believe will grow at an above-average rate over the coming decades. They won't always perform as hoped, but if you research your candidates well and then follow the progress of whatever companies you invest in, you stand a chance of outperformance. Here, for example, are some 15-year growth rates of a few familiar companies -- plus what they would have turned $1,000 into over that period:

4. Invest in yourself
Another great way to invest is in yourself. Shelley Duvall offered one example above, that of buying new clothes. You might also develop yourself professionally in other ways, though, such as by taking a course or seeking a new certification or maybe even learning a new language.
You can invest in yourself in ways that benefit not only your work life but your personal life, as well. For example, get fit and stay fit. You might spend the $1,000 on some time with a personal trainer or on a treadmill or on a gym membership. You might also spend the money on travel. Travel can seem like a luxury, and in some ways it is, but it's also immensely valuable -- especially when you travel abroad. Doing so exposes you to different cultures and broadens your perspective as you see different places and how people live there. Some studies even suggest that travel can boost your creativity.
This last invest-in-yourself suggestion may seem off, but if you're very unhappy with the state of your life right now, you might spend that $1,000 on counseling. Seeing a therapist might help you identify problematic issues and work toward resolving or improving them or simply dealing with them more effectively.

            });
        

5. Give it away
Finally, even if you're not exactly where you want to be in life and could really use a $1,000 widescreen TV or a fancier bicycle, consider giving the money away instead. We tend not to think too much about the fact that billions of people around the world, including millions in the U.S., are trying to live on just a few dollars per day. A $1,000 gift could go a long way toward helping those less fortunate than yourself. It could, via Heifer.org, give four water buffalos to needy families who could use them and possibly lift themselves out of hunger and poverty with them. It could, alternatively, give 50 needy families flocks of ducks or chicks or geese that could help sustain them for a long period. It could, via DonorsChoose.org, provide needed resources for 20 or more public school classrooms. Through FeedingAmerica.org, $1,000 could provide 11,000 meals to people facing hunger. Through Ashoka.org, it could help support a social entrepreneur working to tackle a big issue (such as human rights, the environment, hunger, poverty, education, crime, or health) in an innovative way. Remember, too, that charitable donations can result in welcome tax deductions.
With a little thought, you may be able to spend your $1,000 in a much more productive way than you originally planned to -- while greatly benefiting others as well.

","5 Smart Things You Can Do With $1,000 Right Now "

Data center REIT Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) reported first-quarter earnings (core FFO) that handily beat analyst expectations. In addition to strong headline numbers, Digital Realty's report was full of positive news for shareholders. Here's a quick rundown of Digital Realty's first quarter, and where the company could go from here.
A strong first quarter, and increased 2017 guidance
Digital Realty reported core funds from operations (core FFO), the REIT equivalent of ""earnings,"" of $1.52 per share, $0.05 above analysts' expectations and a 7% increase over last year. In addition, the company slightly raised its full-year core FFO outlook from $5.90-$6.10 to $5.95-$6.10, which was welcome news to investors.

Revenue increased 9% year over year, and the company signed leases totaling $50 million in annual rental income, in addition to $46 million in lease renewals representing a 3.1% rent increase. And the company is confident that the strong results will continue. ""We are encouraged by the favorable intermediate-term outlook, given healthy market fundamentals, a supportive macro environment, and secular demand tailwinds,"" said CEO A. William Stein.
Balance sheet improvements
One of the reasons I own Digital Realty in my own portfolio is for its excellent financial condition. For starters, the company has virtually no debt maturities until 2020.

Image source: Digital Realty investor presentation.

In addition, Digital Realty has a debt-to-capitalization ratio of just 25.3% (29.6% including preferred stock). This is down 4.4% from last year and quite low for a REIT, and the vast majority of Digital Realty's debt is fixed-rate, which mitigates the company's interest rate risk. During the quarter, Digital Realty continued to retire its higher-interest debts, redeeming debt and preferred stock with interest rates of 5.73% and 6.625%, respectively, and the company anticipates a debt issuance between $400 million and $600 million at a rate of 3.5% to 4.25% to occur later in 2017.

            });
        

Strong performance for over a decade -- will it continue?
Digital Realty has produced impressive growth for some time now. In fact, the company's core FFO has grown at a 14% annualized rate since 2005, and the dividend has been increased every year since then. The stock has generated a 1,530% total return over that 12-year period (26% annualized), a remarkable level of performance, especially when you consider that it includes one of the worst recessions in history. Just look at Digital Realty's performance compared to the S&P 500:

DLR Total Return Price data by YCharts.
Additionally, there's no reason to believe the strong growth cannot continue going forward. Demand for data centers is still growing rapidly, and is even outpacing supply in several key markets. Cloud data traffic is expected to grow at an annual pace of over 30% per year through 2020, according to Cisco. To name a few examples, in the major data center markets of Northern Virginia, Dallas, and Chicago, the market is absorbing new data centers at twice the rate of current construction pipelines.
The bottom line is that there should be no shortage of growth opportunities in the coming years for Digital Realty, and with its lean balance sheet and financial flexibility, it will have the cash it needs to grow along with the market.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/25/3-dividend-aristocrats-we-refuse-to-buy-2.aspx,2017-04-25,"
The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats is the perfect hunting ground for income investors. The group, after all, comprises niche stocks that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. But even within this enviable group, some stocks are better than the rest, while some are best avoided for better options elsewhere.
To that end, our contributors believe you could easily pass on The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX), Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), and T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) for better Dividend Aristocrats. Here's why. 
A good company at a bad price
Tim Green (The Clorox Company): Clorox is a solid company with a stable of well-known brands. It's best known for Clorox bleach, but its other brands include Liquid Plumr, Pine-Sol, Brita, Fresh Step, and Glad, to name a few. The company isn't growing very fast, but high-teens operating margins and ample free cash flow allow it to buy back plenty of shares, boosting its per-share earnings.

Image source: Getty Images

Clorox has increased its quarterly dividend each year since 1977. The dividend yield isn't all that high at about 2.4%, but it's still well above the yield of the S&P 500. The problem with Clorox as a dividend stock, though, is the valuation. Clorox produced $4.92 in GAAP earnings in fiscal 2016, putting its price-to-earnings ratio at a little over 27. That's awfully expensive for a company growing as sluggishly as Clorox.
Paying a premium for quality makes sense, but paying nearly 30 times earnings for a company that is driving most of its earnings growth via share buybacks seems excessive. Clorox isn't a growth company, yet it's being valued like one. While I appreciate the long streak of dividend increases, I can't justify paying such a high price.
An unstable business makes for risky dividends
Neha Chamaria (Archer Daniels Midland Company): When I'm looking for dividend stocks, I'm generally wary of one with fortunes tied closely to uncontrollable macro factors. Archer Daniels Midland is a perfect example. As a processor and seller of agricultural commodities, ADM's profits and cash flows can be very volatile, as they're subject to unpredictable farm fundamentals. You just have to see the trend in ADM's key operating metrics in recent years to know what I mean.

ADM Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts.
Now that doesn't look too appealing, does it? Of course, it's commendable that ADM has still managed to increase its dividends every year since the beginning of the decade, but those increases haven't been too impressive, either. Its last two dividend increases have been 7% each. ADM's dividend yield of 2.8% isn't among the best, either, and the stock has returned only about 10% in the past three years on a total returns basis versus the S&P 500's 27% return.
Here's another worrisome statistic from ADM's books: Its free cash flows dipped to $593 million last year from over $4 billion each in 2013 and 2014. That's how challenging the agri-business can be. As another potential red flag, ADM's dividends overshot its free cash flow last year, which is why I'd avoid ADM and shop elsewhere for stronger dividends.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-88804');
            });
        

A not-so-bright future
Jordan Wathen (T. Rowe Price): If you asked me four years ago, I would have never named T. Rowe Price as a Dividend Aristocrat I would avoid. Today, though, I think it's becoming clear that the future for asset management calls for more passive funds (indexes and ETFs) and fewer actively managed mutual funds.
The best days for an active manager like T. Rowe Price are likely in the rearview mirror. With about $810 billion of assets under management (AUM), the company generates the bulk of its revenue and earnings from management fees on $450 billion of equity strategies, which typically carry a higher fee than bond strategies.
Importantly, T. Rowe Price has been most successful as a manager of U.S. stock funds, which I believe are most exposed to the risk of losing assets to lower-cost index fund products. In 2016, the company collected an average fee of 0.48% on all AUM, stock and bond, domestic and international. When I compare that to sub-0.10% expense ratios of a myriad of passive funds, I wonder for how much longer its clients will be able to justify paying at nearly five times more for a product where the expected result is a return less than lower-cost substitutes. By their nature, active funds tend to hold more cash, trade more frequently, and charge higher fees, creating a drag on their clients' returns relative to passive funds and ETFs.
I can't dispute T. Rowe Price's historical record or history of dividend growth, but I think the future will look very different from the past. When the fortunes of an entire industry deteriorate, there is little that separates the best companies from the worst.

",3 Dividend Aristocrats We Refuse to Buy
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/28/deferred-tax-assets-what-are-they-and-why-do-they.aspx,2017-04-28,"
A bank never wants to lose money, but there can be an upside to doing so if the loss creates a deferred tax asset, which allows a company to offset future income with previously unclaimed losses for the purposes of calculating federal income taxes.
These seemingly esoteric assets are both easy to understand and very important right now for two of the nation's biggest banks: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C).
Defining deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets generally don't play a major role at consistently profitable companies. That's because they tend to materialize when a company reports more in losses than it's able to claim as a deduction on its income statement in a given year.
The unused portion of losses can be carried forward to offset a bank's net income in future years. It's the value of this carry-forward that's captured by a bank's deferred tax assets, which are recorded as intangible assets on the balance sheet.

Image source: Getty Images.

One quality of deferred tax assets is particularly important to keep in mind: They expire if not used after a set amount of time, often 20 years. This matters because a bank that isn't able to use all of its deferred tax assets before they expire must write the remaining value off, reducing shareholders' equity.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-22782');
            });
        


This also matters because changes to the corporate income tax rate impact the value of deferred tax assets. When rates go up, these assets increase in value, as they shelter a larger share of income. But when rates go down, so too does the value of deferred tax assets, as a bank may not be able to realize the entire benefit before the statute of limitations expires.
Bank of America and Citigroup's deferred tax assets
The relationship between the corporate income tax rate and the value of deferred tax assets is especially relevant right now, given Trump's proposed plan to cut corporate income taxes from a top rate of 35% down to 15%.
Make no mistake about it, a tax cut this significant would be a boon to Bank of America and Citigroup, both of which rank among the 10 biggest taxpayers on the S&P 500. Based on its income and effective tax rate last year, Bank of America's tax liability would have declined by approximately $3.5 billion. Citigroup's would have dropped by around $3.2 billion.

Image source: Getty Images.

But the catch is that both of these banks would also likely be forced to write off a portion of their unusually large deferred tax assets, which stem from their outsized financial crisis-related losses. At the end of last year, Citigroup reported $47 billion worth of net deferred tax assets, while Bank of America's are valued at $19 billion.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-17921');
            });
        


According to analysts, Trump's proposed tax cut could translate into anywhere from a $6 billion to $12 billion charge-off at Citigroup, and around $4 billion at Bank of America. That's a lot of money, regardless of these banks' multi-trillion dollar balance sheets.
Don't get me wrong, Bank of America and Citigroup would still benefit immensely from the annual tax savings of a lower rate, though they will first have to contend with the fall in value of their deferred tax assets.

So far the stock market has had a pretty good year, with the S&P 500 up over 6% while the NASDAQ has jumped 12%. But please, don't take this as a sign that you've missed the boat.
While there's no telling where the stock market will head over the short run, there's one undeniable fact that can never be repeated enough: over the long run, the stock market is the greatest wealth creator the world has ever seen.

Image source: Getty Images

Today, I'm going to share five consumer service stocks that I believe could help create such wealth. And my money is firmly where my mouth is: I own all five stocks. Each of these companies has two or three very powerful forces that make them worthy of your investment dollars.



Company

What it Does





Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)


Global e-commerce juggernaut




Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN)


Leading hotel and airline booking site




Ctrip.com (NASDAQ:CTRP)


Same as Priceline, but focused primarily on China




Mercadolibre (NASDAQ:MELI)


E-commerce and payment specialist for Latin America




Bitauto (NYSE:BITA)


Chinese site for buying, selling, financing cars




The strength of a moat
By far the most important thing to investigate in any stock purchase is the sustainable competitive advantage -- or ""moat"" -- that the underlying company has. Over the long run, a wide moat is what keeps customers coming back for more, year after year, while keeping the competition at bay.
All five of these companies benefit from one of the strongest moats imaginable: the network effect. With each new customer that joins the site, a vendor has added incentive to join the platform. And with each new vendor that joins the platform, potential customers have added incentive to visit the site. It's a virtuous cycle that creates massive wealth.
Amazon's third-party sales are booming thanks to the fact that many smaller businesses realize that it's beneficial to use the company's fulfillment services and list their products on Amazon. Mercadolibre is in the same boat -- it literally creates the market for selling goods in Latin America.
Priceline owns Booking.com, one of the most popular sites in Europe for finding hotels. Ctrip has followed in Priceline's footsteps to create a ""one-stop shop"" for any Chinese citizen's travel needs, including planes, trains, buses, hotels, and packaged trips.
And while Bitauto might be a lesser-known name, the company has attracted investments from some of China's biggest names as it becomes a leading platform to advertise, buy, and sell cars on the Internet.
Optionality creates multiple futures
We need to accept the fact that we can't predict the future. As such, it's impossible to know how a company's current line of business will perform in the future. One way to hedge against unexpected troubles is to invest in companies that embrace multiple futures.
Another way of saying this is that we should be investing in companies that have shown an ability to adapt and evolve over time. They tinker with low-risk experiments: if those experiments fail, they have the option to kill them. If they succeed, they have the option to continue following them. The key is that losses are limited, while gains have no cap.
Amazon is the poster child for optionality: starting as a book store, adding an e-reader, expanding to far more than just books, offering free shipping for an annual fee, paying for original content, and even becoming a cloud king.
But Amazon's not alone: Priceline owns OpenTable, a restaurant booking app. Ctrip's foray into trains and buses is still in its infancy, Mercadolibre's MercadoPago is becoming a huge source of revenue as a payment option, and Bitauto has found new life by offering to connect car dealers with financiers who are willing to loan money for payments.
The bottom line is that none of these five is locked into a single line of business, and all have the potential to -- through trial and error -- stumble upon another huge opportunity.

            });
        

Skin in the game
Finally, I almost always look for companies where management has lots of skin in the game via stock holdings. Even more so, I'm constantly on the lookout for founder-led companies, as founders have existential motivation to make something that is both lasting and powerful.
Alas, Priceline doesn't fit this bill, as its founders are long gone and management currently owns less than 1% of shares outstanding. But the rest of these companies have management with lots of skin in the game.

By investing with these companies, you are putting your money in the hands of folks who have the exact same incentives -- long-term value creations -- that you should be hoping for.
Taken together, these five account for 32% of my real-life stock holdings. The combination of a wide moat, optionality, and skin in the game gives me confidence that they will continue to be long term winners, and the conviction to say that they are worth buying in 2017.

As for individual stocks, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) attracted heavy investor interest following their respective quarterly earnings reports.

Hasbro's winning the game
Hasbro shares jumped almost 6% following surprisingly strong first-quarter results for the toymaker, in which revenue ticked up 2% to $850 million and earnings jumped 41% to $0.54 per share. Analysts were looking for closer to $827 million of sales and profits of just $0.38 per share.

Image source: Hasbro.

In contrast to rival Mattel, which last week revealed sharp sales declines across many key brands, Hasbro enjoyed steady growth at its core franchises including Monopoly, Nerf, and Transformers. Licensed brands as a group fell 18%, but that was due to an unusually strong prior-year period that included robust sales around Star Wars and Marvel theatrical releases.
Its overall increase also came courtesy of a spike in demand for its gaming segment that includes the digital mobile hit Transformers: Earth Wars.
""Our first-quarter results were consistent with the expectations we shared with you in February,"" CEO Brian Goldner said in a conference call to investors. The numbers ""position us well to execute against the major theatrical and content releases as well as innovate new play experiences planned for the full year,"" he continued.
Despite a dip in profitability this quarter, Goldner and his team still expect operating profit margin to improve for the full year as sales growth speeds up thanks to big new releases ahead in the Disney Princess, Star Wars, and My Little Pony franchises.

Kimberly-Clark lowers expectations
Shares of consumer products giant Kimberly-Clark, which owns popular brands such as Kleenex and Huggies, dropped following the release of its fiscal first-quarter results, but the stock rebounded to a basically flat return for the day. The company posted declining organic sales thanks mainly to weakness in the key U.S. market. Executives blamed soft demand and spiking competition for the fact that revenue fell 3% in the U.S. geography.
But they were encouraged that they still managed to boost profits. ""We delivered earnings growth in the first quarter despite a challenging environment, particularly in North America,"" CEO Thomas Falk said in a press release.
The company lowered its full-year sales growth outlook slightly -- to a range of between 1% and 2% compared to the earlier target of ""approximately 2%."" That new figure would mark the company's second straight year of decelerating sales. Kimberly-Clark still believes its 2017 gains will be driven by higher sales volumes, but investors will be hoping for better figures than the ones the company managed this quarter. Volumes rose by just 1% despite a more-than-1% drop in prices. If those negative trends continue, they're likely to overwhelm Kimberly-Clark's cost-cutting moves and push profitability lower.

Investors can look forward to dozens of big-name earnings reports over the coming days, including a few notable announcements on the way from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).
Apple's iPhone plans
Apple announces its earnings results on Tuesday afternoon, and given that the company generates a significant portion of U.S. corporate earnings, the announcement could move the broader market. Investors have recently pushed the stock to new all-time highs following blowout quarterly results in late January that showed record revenue and surging profits for the consumer tech titan. The success of the iPhone 7 played a key role in Apple's boosting its earnings to $3.36 per share, in part thanks to rising average selling prices.

For the current quarter, CEO Tim Cook and his executive team forecast revenue stopping at between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion, which would ensure the company's second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue gains following three consecutive declines. Gross profit margin is likely to dip slightly to between 38% and 39% of sales. Besides core metrics like iPhone sales, services revenue, and profitability, investors will be closely following the Mac maker's outlook for the coming quarter ahead of an expected major upgrade to the iPhone this fall.
Facebook's advertising trends
Expectations are running high for Facebook's earnings report on Wednesday. Consensus estimates call for revenue to spike 45% higher to pass $7.8 billion. Profits should rise at the same pace to reach $1.12 per share. 
The social media titan has cautioned investors to expect slowing sales growth this year since it has reached the point where advertisement volume in its service can't increase without negatively impacting the user experience. In fact, this quarter's sales gains might look paltry compared to the 57% spike Facebook enjoyed for the full 2016 year. 
Still, that downshift doesn't mean the company is set for stagnation. Video is becoming a much more integral part of the service, and it should raise the value of ads both to users and to advertisers. For evidence of that trend playing out, look for Facebook to show continued increases in its user base even as operating margin improves. The company has successfully navigated several major challenges to its business model in the past, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his team aim to keep the positive momentum going as Facebook enters its sixth year as a public company.

Activision's digital revenue
Booming player engagement, a growing portfolio of hit brands, and seemingly endless opportunities for revenue growth have combined to push Activision Blizzard shares higher by 50% over the past 12 months. That rally raises the pressure on the video-game publisher to post head-turning numbers when it announces first-quarter results on Thursday afternoon.

Consensus estimates call for sales to jump 20% in the seasonally weak period to just over $1 billion. As it did late last year, Activision will likely benefit from growth in digital sales, which should push profitability higher.
Investors will be watching engagement metrics in core brands like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and the recently launched Overwatch for signs that gamers remain locked in its entertainment umbrella. Look for CEO Bobby Kotick to also update shareholders on the company's monetization initiatives in the mobile business it recently acquired from King Digital. 
",3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/24/a-foolish-take-which-company-is-winning-the-video.aspx,2017-04-24,"
The modern video game console market is dominated by three companies: Sony (NYSE:SNE), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY). Sony's current-generation consoles include the handheld PS Vita and the PlayStation 4. Microsoft's home console is the Xbox One, and Nintendo sells the handheld 3DS, the Wii U home console, and a new hybrid handheld and home console called the Switch.
As we can see in the following graph (which doesn't include Switch figures yet), Nintendo's 3DS is currently the most popular console in the world, followed by Sony's PlayStation 4 (figures are units shipped since each console's launch).

Data source: VGChartz. Chart created by the author.

The longevity of Nintendo's 6-year-old 3DS is impressive, since smartphone games were expected to render handheld consoles obsolete. Its popularity was mainly fueled by compact versions of Nintendo's hit first-party franchises like Pokemon, Mario Kart, and Super Mario 3D Land.
The PS4 and Xbox One offer many similar high-end games, but Sony is differentiating its console with the new PlayStation VR headset. The Xbox One doesn't offer a comparable virtual reality (VR) product yet, but it lets Windows 10 users stream their console games to PCs. Both companies are upgrading their consoles for 4K gaming. Sony launched the PS4 Pro last autumn, and Microsoft plans to launch a more powerful Xbox One, codenamed Project Scorpio, later this year.
The video gaming market will likely be fragmented this year, with casual gamers favoring the Switch and hardcore gamers focusing on 4K and VR gaming with Sony's and Microsoft's updated consoles. Investors will be watching carefully to see if Nintendo's attempt to merge the handheld and home console markets helps it reinvent the market it revolutionized three decades ago. If so, Sony and Microsoft might need to respond with similar hybrid plays.

",A Foolish Take: Which Company Is Winning the Video Game Console Wars?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/04/3-stocks-you-dont-have-to-babysit-5.aspx,2017-05-04,"
A smart investor doesn't really have to do much to get rich. The trick lies in choosing the right kind of stocks that require no babysitting but keep filling your coffers while you stand back. That requires investing in rock-solid businesses with moats and financial fortitude that can withstand the test of time and continue to grow, year after year.
Finding such stocks isn't easy, though; so to help you start, I analyzed a basket of companies and found three incredible ones -- Waste Management (NYSE:WM), 3M (NYSE:MMM), and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) -- that look poised to grow and need absolutely no babysitting unless their industry dynamics change in an entirely unanticipated manner that may require revisiting your investment decisions. Here's why.
Making money from trash
A company providing an essential service like hauling, disposing, and recycling waste is unlikely to go out of business unless we stop producing waste. As for competition, it's no cakewalk setting up and operating landfills and recycling facilities, both of which require huge capital investments and regulatory commitments. More often than not, haulers dispose waste at others' landfills for a tipping fee.

Image source: Getty Images.

It is this essential nature of its business and high barriers to entry that make Waste Management such a great stock to own, more so because Waste Management is the leader in the industry today with nearly 250 landfill sites and more than 130 landfill gas-to-energy conversion facilities that cater to the needs of more than 21 million customers across homes and diverse industries in the U.S. and Canada. One of Waste Management's biggest competitive advantages is that it deals in end-to-end waste management, right from collection to disposal and recycling. Simply put, when you own Waste Management, you're betting on a leader in a defensive industry. Such a stock typically needs no babysitting.
Don't expect Waste Management to grow like gangbusters, but what you can expect is security and stability of income and dividends. A recession-proof business has allowed Waste Management to generate consistent cash flows over the years and increase its dividends for 14 consecutive years. With the company paying out less than 60% of net income and free cash flow in dividends currently, there's enough room for growth. Waste Management's dividend yield might not be the best at 2.34%, but you can see below how the stock's total returns have trampled the S&P 500 total returns in the past five years. 

MMM Total Return Price data by YCharts.
As you can also see, returns from 3M and Mastercard have been no less impressive, and I explain below why. 
Ever wonder how profitable Scotch Tape's manufacturer is?
It's nothing short of fascinating how 3M has grown from a manufacturer of low-key products like Post-it Notes and Scotch Tape to a megaconglomerate with 60,000 products, 100,000 patents, and sales topping $30 billion last year. 3M's profits and cash flows have grown steadily over the years. Guess 3M's average return on equity for the past decade? It's a stunning 32%: There's no better proof of management's efficiency.

MMM Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts.
The end result of 3M's diversity and prudent management is that shareholders have not only made big capital gains but have also enjoyed uninterrupted and growing dividends over the years.
In fact, a record of 59 years of consecutive dividend increases makes 3M an extraordinary dividend stock, and there appears to be no stopping the company. With management targeting earnings-per-share growth of 8%-11% through 2020, you can rest assured 3M will continue to make you money for years to come.

You swipe, Mastercard mints
If you're looking for a solid, long-term play in a disruptive industry, look no further than payment processor behemoth Mastercard.
Every time someone somewhere swipes a Mastercard credit or debit card, the company earns a small fee. There's growing evidence that the world is rapidly adopting plastic money -- Mastercard's switched transactions, or simply its transaction count, jumped 16% in 2016. If you're wondering about Mastercard's growth potential, consider that nearly 85% -- yes, you read that right -- of all global transactions are still driven by cash and checks.

It's not surprising, then, that management is confident about growing its EPS mid-teens through 2018. Growth in digital payments should be the biggest driver, of course, but the company's value-added services and foray into other areas of electronic payments via acquisitions like VocaLink should provide further impetus. Mastercard proved its mettle by growing revenue and EPS by 11% and 10%, respectively, in 2016 despite major headwinds like Brexit and a stronger dollar. With fast-developing countries like India now advocating plastic money like never before, Mastercard is poised for solid growth, reaping you rich rewards along the way.

",3 Stocks You Don't Have to Babysit
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/03/31/3-top-stocks-to-buy-for-your-kids.aspx,2017-03-31,"
Buying stocks for your kids can be a great way to teach them about investing and get them an early start on building their financial futures. But which to buy? Our panel of writers has identified two top stocks and a top exchange-traded fund for budding investors. Read on to learn why Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO), and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) made the list. 
Stick with a childhood favorite
Dan Caplinger (Walt Disney): When you want to buy a stock for your kids, you need to look at it from two points of view. First, you want a stock that's most likely to provide good long-term returns, because you want to give your child a positive investing experience from the start while taking maximum advantage of the time your child has to watch even modest amounts of money grow. Second, you want a company with which your child is familiar, because that way, the connection between a stock and the business that the company does will be clear.

Disney makes a great choice by these measures for a number of reasons. Children of all ages are quite familiar with Disney's offerings, but they might not realize just how extensive the entertainment giant's empire is. Offerings like the Disney Channel and Disney theme parks carry the corporate name and are thus obvious draws, but many kids don't realize that networks like ESPN and movie franchises like Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm are actually Disney properties. This extensive group of content-producing businesses gives Disney much of its long-term value, and popular entertainment franchises are only likely to grow in the years to come. If you want to start your child's portfolio on the right foot, Disney makes a great choice to achieve both solid returns and the educational value of investing in companies with which your child will be quite familiar.
The leader in a popular space
Keith Noonan (Activision Blizzard): Like Dan, I subscribe to the idea that buying strong companies that your kids have a connection with is a good way to introduce them to the world of investing. With those qualities in mind, I think that Activision Blizzard would make a great starter stock.
Video games are more popular than ever, and Activision Blizzard's leading position in the space means that it's a stock that has the potential to grow along with your kids' interest in investing. Between Skylanders, Candy Crush Saga, and Hearthstone, the company has a wide range of franchises that are popular with children, and it also produces titles geared toward older audiences, so there's a good chance that your kids will have some familiarity with the company's franchises regardless of what age group they're in -- and that they'll maintain a connection with its products as they get older.
No video game software company has a more potent catalog of franchises than Activision Blizzard, and the publisher's strong track record of quality and innovation combined with the strength of its properties points to big things down the line. The company is also benefiting from an industry trend that sees more consumers purchasing games directly from publishers through digital downloads, and it looks poised to be a leader in emerging categories like virtual reality and e-sports. 
With strong growth prospects and a relatable line of products, Activision Blizzard looks like a great stock to buy for your kids.

Instead of just one, buy several hundred
Jason Hall (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF): Buying stocks for kids is usually intended to do two things:

Make them money.
Teach them about investing. 

For this reason, a lot of articles like this tend to focus on ""kid-friendly"" companies, often toymakers, entertainment purveyors, or consumer brands with which children can identify. If a kid owns part of a company he's familiar with, it will make investing more fun and attainable, right? 
The downside, of course, is a bad choice -- or just bad timing -- can lead to losses that can take years to recover, raining all over your ""Let's learn about making money with stocks!"" parade. Furthermore, kids can lose interest in a brand quickly, and if the kid doesn't care about the toy or the clothing maker anymore, they may lose interest in the stock. For these reasons, more parents should at least consider buying shares of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF instead. 
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF tracks the performance of the 500 large-cap stocks in the S&P 500. It currently has an expense ratio of 0.05% and offers a 2.01% dividend yield at the current price. 
It may not be as exciting as an individual stock, but instead of the occasional ""Hey, you own part of the company that makes that thing!"" moment, owning a piece of the S&P 500 will give you almost constant opportunities to teach how investing in stocks is ownership of real companies that make products and provide services. It's also a solid long-term investment, averaging nearly 10% per year in annualized returns. 
If you're unsure of which stock to buy, or concerned your kid may lose interest in a single company, give the S&P 500 index a shot. 

",3 Top Stocks to Buy for Your Kids
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/03/johnson-johnsons-5-dividend-increase-offers-a-big.aspx,2017-05-03,"
It's that time of the year again when Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) shareholders eagerly await their annual ""raise"" in the form of a higher dividend payout. On Thursday, April 27, J&J obliged once more.
It really shouldn't come as any surprise that Johnson & Johnson chose to increase its dividend payout by 5%, or $0.04 per share, to $0.84 a quarter. After all, Johnson & Johnson is among the most elite of Dividend Aristocrats (companies that have raised their annual dividends for at least 25 consecutive years). With this increase, J&J lifted its annual dividend for the 55th straight year. You can count on just two hands the publicly traded companies have increased their payout for longer than 55 straight years.
Based on the new aggregate annual payout of $3.36 per share, J&J's dividend yield will move higher to 2.7% from 2.6%. More importantly, its yield remains consistently head and shoulders above the average yield of the broad-based S&P 500. Combined with its exceptionally low volatility, J&J's superior income potential is what makes it a staple holding for pre- and post-retirees.

Image source: Getty Images.

Could J&J's dividend increase offers clues about its future?
However, J&J's recently announced dividend increase may also offer a pretty big clue as to what the future might hold for the company.
If you recall, back in late March I took an educated guess as to how much J&J would raise its quarterly dividend this year. My guess was $0.85, so I was $0.01 too optimistic. But it's the comparison of this year's increase to increases in previous years that has me intrigued.
Here's an eight-year rundown of J&J's dividend increases on a percentage basis:

2010: 10.2%
2011: 5.6%
2012: 7%
2013: 8.1%
2014: 6.1%
2015: 7.1%
2016: 6.7%
2017: 5% 

You'll note that this this year's increase of 5% is actually a low mark over the past eight years. It's possible the rule of large numbers is catching up a bit with J&J, as its payout has grown from $0.49 to $0.84 per quarter over the above years. But I wouldn't buy this thesis. Instead, I believe there's something else at play that caused J&J to moderate its dividend hike in 2017.

Image source: Getty Images.

It's simple: J&J wants to keep shopping 
Johnson & Johnson recently announced its intent to acquire Swiss-based lung drug specialist Actelion (NASDAQOTH:ALIOF) for $30 billion. The deal, which gives J&J sole possession of Actelion's pulmonary arterial hypertension portfolio and a 16% stake in an expected spinoff company that'll contain Actelion's developing drug candidates, is expected to boost J&J's long-term growth rate by 1.5% to 2% annually. When combined with share buybacks, Wall Street has J&J pegged for 5% to 7% annual EPS growth through 2020.
In other words, there should be sufficient EPS growth to justify dividend hikes of 6% to 7% per year. Yet J&J, which has long kept its payout ratio right around or above 50%, could be sporting a payout ratio of between 44% and 47% based on Wall Street's full-year EPS consensus for 2018 and 2017, respectively, which is a bit low.
My suspicion is that J&J is still adamant about using acquisitions to bolster its bottom-line, and it wants to use as much of its free cash flow as possible to make that happen.
If we look at J&J's first-quarter report, we can see pretty clear evidence that it's going to need some sort of inorganic growth to help offset weaker sales in key pharmaceutical products. Remicade's sales fell by a low single-digit percentage as biosimilar competition hits pharmacy shelves, while blockbuster SGLT2 inhibitor Invokana, used to treat type 2 diabetes, saw sales plunge 17% year-over-year in the United States. After regularly delivering high-single-digit pharma sales growth, J&J's domestic pharma sales declined 0.4% in Q1 2017. That's unacceptable, and it demands an immediate fix.
Acquisitions give J&J the pathway to that quick fix, and more modest dividend increases would give J&J even more cash flow to work with.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-93152');
            });
        

The most logical acquisition 
Historically, large acquisitions aren't J&J's bread-and-butter. It much often prefers to acquire small- and mid-sized companies that it can mold to fit its more than 250-subsidiary puzzle. While deciding which company might be on J&J's radar is nothing more than a dart throw at best, the most logical acquisition could be current developmental partner Geron (NASDAQ:GERN).
In Nov. 2014, J&J handed over $35 million in upfront cash to Geron and dangled a $900 million milestone bounty for development-, regulatory-, and sales-based milestones associated with imetelstat. This is a drug targeted at myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndromes. 
In early stage studies, imetelstat generated partial and complete responses in myelofibrosis patients, which is something that had never before been seen in a clinical trial. In fact, the only approved therapy for myelofibrosis patients (a drug called Jakafi) treats some of the symptoms associated with the disease, such as an enlarged spleen, but does nothing to thwart the progression of the disease. In short, imetelstat could become the clear go-to myelofibrosis drug if approved, and thusly have blockbuster potential. A positive late-stage study could coerce J&J to acquire Geron and save itself the trouble of paying milestones and royalties.
Long story short, don't be surprised if J&J's intermediate-term dividend hikes are a bit disappointing as it focuses on reigniting domestic pharma growth through acquisitions.

",Johnson & Johnson's 5% Dividend Increase Offers a Big Clue About Its Future
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/02/better-buy-intuitive-surgical-inc-vs-medtronic.aspx,2017-05-02,"
Stocks of medical device companies have been hot this year, with the iShares U.S. Medical Device ETF doubling the S&P 500's 7% return so far in 2017. Should investors buy the biggest name in this space, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) or put money into the leader of robotic surgical systems, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)? 
The case for Intuitive Surgical
Intuitive Surgical makes the da Vinci line of surgical robots and dominates that niche of the medical device industry. Intuitive's business is a razor-and-blades model, as it sells the robot systems for between $600,000 and $2.5 million and then makes most of its money selling the service on the units and the supplies that are required for each surgical procedure. The recurring revenue from service and supplies is a big attraction for investors because of the steadiness and predictability it brings, and in the most recent quarter, it amounted to 77% of the total business.

Image source: Pixabay.

Driving much of the growth for Intuitive -- 13% in revenue and 20% in earnings per share in 2016 -- are new procedures for the machines. While urological and gynecological procedures were the big growth engines in past years, now general surgery, especially hernia repair, is creating the best growth in procedures in the U.S. An opportunity still ahead is thoracic surgery, which accounts for over 100,000 procedures per day in this country.
Outside the U.S., growth in utilization of the machines is even stronger, generating a 28% increase in procedure volume in the first quarter, compared with 18% procedure growth across all geographies.
Even as surgeons are using da Vinci robots for more kinds of surgeries, Intuitive continues to innovate and launch new platforms that will refresh system sales and open up new uses for them. The upcoming da Vinci X delivers the most sophisticated features at a more attractive price point, which should broaden the market. The da Vinci Sp, for single-port surgeries, should launch within a year and open up new procedures such as transoral surgery on the mouth and throat. Further out is a flexible catheter system that will be able to reach into parts of the body that are not accessible to robotic surgery today.
The case for Medtronic
Whereas Intuitive Surgical is the big dog in robotic surgery, Medtronic is huge across the whole medical device space, with 10 times the revenue of Intuitive. With products like pacemakers, heart valves, patient monitors, surgical staplers, and insulin pumps, the company is diversified across so many product lines that its business is very stable. As long as people are getting sick, Medtronic can continue to generate cash and pay a dividend.
The flip side of stability is growth, and Medtronic has been challenged to come up with much of that in recent years, particularly on the bottom line. GAAP earnings per share for the most recent four quarters stands at roughly the same as it was in 2011.
However, the company has been making changes that are likely to result in higher growth and better margins going forward. The 2015 merger with Covidien had the company called out for criticism by President Obama for the tax inversion aspect of it, but it did broaden the company's offerings significantly and added some growth areas. The company continues to take out cost ""synergies,"" and the improving margins have started to rev up the bottom line. Earlier this month, Medtronic announced it was getting $6.1 billion from Cardinal Health for a group of businesses that actually declined in revenue last quarter. Nice move. Cardinal Health's stock plunged 11% on the news, but Medtronic said the transaction ""is expected to result in an immediate positive impact to Medtronic's comparable, constant currency revenue growth rate and non-GAAP comparable, constant currency operating margin.""
Company management is holding firm on its view that it can deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and at least 10% EPS growth in 2017 and in years to come, despite some analysts questioning that in the last conference call. Growth is pretty evenly balanced between the four product groups and across geographies, with no real problem areas standing out. The company is big enough that no one new product will move the needle very much, but the $2 billion it spends on research and development every year is yielding promising new products such as the world's smallest pacemaker, an artificial pancreas, and new surgical stapling products. Medtronic is even partnering with Mazor Robotics to be able to offer its own surgery robots, but shipments of those products are likely to be small enough not to be a threat to Intuitive for many years, if ever.
The company is a standout dividend payer, yielding 2.1% and having raised its dividend for 39 straight years and grown it at a 12% compound annual rate over the last five years.

            });
        

The better buy
This choice comes down to a big, steady company with a dependable dividend and a much smaller company that is dominating its niche with faster growth and a long runway ahead of it. As one might expect, Medtronic has a much more affordable valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about half that of Intuitive Surgical's. 
While Medtronic may very well be a better pick for some conservative investors who would shy away from Intuitive's forward P/E of 36 times, I will pick Intuitive Surgical. I think things are looking up for Medtronic investors, but management's ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth over many years and net of restructurings and acquisition costs is yet to be seen. Meanwhile, Intuitive Surgical's current growth, future opportunities, and dominant market share, along with the predictability that comes with recurring revenue from its ""razor blades"" make it more attractive to me. Patient investors may find a more favorable entry point, though.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/29/this-stock-just-raised-its-dividend-by-94-and-trad.aspx,2017-04-29,"
Mall real estate investment trust (REIT) Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) recently announced strong first-quarter results, as well as a 9.4% year-over-year dividend increase. The stock now yields more than 4.2% per year, but trades for just over its 52-week low. Is now a good time to get in on this unique retail REIT?
Simon Property Group: The short version
Simon Property Group is actually the largest REIT of any kind in the United States. The company invests in mall properties, many of which are under its ""Premium Outlets"" and ""The Mills"" brand names. As of this writing, Simon owns or has an interest in about 230 properties with about 190 million square feet of space.

Image source: Getty Images.

Simon does some of its growth through acquisitions, but the company's preferred growth mechanism is ground-up development, which is typically the better value-creator. Think of it this way: If a mall property is worth $10 million, but you can build the exact same property for $8 million, developing it yourself produces $2 million of instant value. Of course, this is a simplified example, but the point is that if it's done right, development has the potential to produce much better returns than acquisitions. As of the end of the first quarter, Simon has four new projects under development, three of which are expected to be completed this year.
Since I specifically brought up Simon's dividend increase, let's take a look at Simon's dividend and performance history. In all, Simon's dividend has grown by 247% since 2000. And while the payout hasn't increased every single year, the track record of growth is pretty strong. Furthermore, the company has generated a 1,470% total return for shareholders in the 21st century (17.6% annualized), handily beating the S&P 500 by a wide margin.

SPG Total Return Price data by YCharts.
A strong first quarter shows that Simon's business model still works
Simon Property Group's first-quarter earnings showed strong growth and income, which is why the stock popped by 2% after the quarterly results were released. David Simon, Chairman and CEO of Simon Property Group, said, ""We are off to a good start in 2017 with the reporting of financial and operational results that exceeded our expectations.""
Simon's funds from operations (FFO) -- the REIT version of earnings -- grew by 4.2% from the same quarter last year. Occupancy was unchanged at 95.6%, which was likely a relief to investors, given the recent headlines involving struggling brick-and-mortar retailers such as Sears and Bebe Stores.
In addition, Simon successfully received a lower interest rate on its $4 billion revolving credit facility, which should set it up for low-cost borrowing in the future. And, the company took advantage of its depressed stock price and repurchased nearly 871,000 of its own shares.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-58958');
            });
        

What sets Simon apart from other mall operators?
Simon's key competitive advantage (other than its size) is that it is willing to invest large amounts of capital and other resources to ensure that its properties provide the best shopping experience, both for shoppers and retailers. Simon's malls tend to have features that 21st-century shoppers want, such as free wi-fi, valet parking, and more dining and entertainment options. To date, Simon has completed redevelopment properties on about half of its properties, and has a few dozen more underway as I write this.
Simon also has about $7 billion in available liquidity, and one of the highest credit ratings in the real estate sector, which gives it the financial flexibility to pursue virtually any opportunities that come up, and at a lower cost than most of its peers.
In addition, Simon treats its tenants as partners, not just a monthly rent check. For example, Simon rolled out an innovative gift card program this past holiday season, which was not only good at any of its malls, but gave shoppers 5% back on their purchases. Programs like this are a win-win. It encourages shoppers to spend their money at Simon's tenants, helping to ensure their success, and specifically encourages shopping at the locations within Simon's properties, which adds value to the retail space Simon leases.
Another example is the fact that Simon has its own venture capital fund, Simon Venture Group, which is actually one of the 10 most active investors in retail technology. Basically, the fund seeks to back emerging technologies that complement Simon's goal of enhancing the shopping experience, bringing brick-and-mortar retail into the modern age to be able to compete with e-commerce alternatives.
The Foolish bottom line
It's true that many retailers are struggling to make ends meet right now, but Simon's business is firing on all cylinders. With the stock trading for just a bit more than its 52-week low, now could be a great time to add this leading high-dividend REIT to your portfolio.

",This Stock Just Raised Its Dividend by 9.4% and Trades Near Its 52-Week Low

According to market researcher PwC Strategy&, the total revenue generated by the automotive industry, ranging from carmakers to technology providers, is currently about $5 trillion. By 2030, this will grow to an estimated $7.8 trillion, and the industry's profits will grow from $400 billion to $600 billion.
Much of the increase in revenue and profit will shift away from carmakers and auto suppliers to technology providers, such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as cars become more like computers on wheels and we move further along the spectrum of autonomous vehicles.

Driverless cars will require highly sophisticated technology, such as sensors, software, and computer processors. Intel, NVIDIA, and Alphabet are leaders in these essential technologies and investors are eyeing them with interest. In addition to choosing a company with the best technology, it's important for investors to consider which company stands to reward shareholders the most from the coming boom in driverless cars. 
Let's take a look at where the three tech giants mentioned above stand to determine which one is the best driverless-car stock for investors looking to get the most bang for their buck.
A game of partnerships
These major tech companies have been in a partnership-forming frenzy to create alliances with leading car manufacturers to accomplish the automotive equivalent of landing a rover on Mars. Alphabet has been working on self-driving cars for several years and has racked up 2 million self-driven miles, but it's not planning to build its own car. Its renamed Waymo division (which stands for ""a new way forward in mobility"") is working on partnerships with carmakers. For its part, Intel plans to acquire Mobileye, an Israel-based technology company purely focused on developing computer vision, data analysis, mapping, and other computer systems for driverless cars.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-9516');
            });
        


But investors considering Intel or Alphabet as a driverless car investment should be mindful of one very important thing. Any future growth from driverless cars will only provide a marginal benefit to Intel's and Alphabet's top lines. Intel's 2016 revenue was $59.4 billion and Alphabet's was $90.3 billion. Let's compare that with the market opportunity. 
PwC Strategy& estimates the revenue opportunity for those providing the technology that helps cars drive themselves will cross $50 billion by 2022. Intel has estimated that the market for vehicle systems, data, and services will be $70 billion by 2030.
If Intel captured 100% of the $70 billion estimated to be the market opportunity in driverless cars, then its revenue would increase 118% over the next 13 years, or about 6% per year. Throw in a few more percentage points of annual growth from its existing business, and investors are looking at a company that might get 10% per year in annual revenue growth, which might be enough for Intel stock to keep pace with the S&P 500 index, but nothing more. 
Alphabet generated $90 billion in revenue in 2016, so its potential upside from driverless cars also offers shareholders marginal benefits. And with so many companies jockeying for position in the driverless car market, it is unrealistic that one company is going to control 100% share of the market.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-42646');
            });
        


If you're looking for a stock with plenty of return potential from driverless cars, you want to find a company that has a small amount of revenue compared to the estimated size of the opportunity. That way there is plenty of room for the company's revenue to expand exponentially by winning market share in the driverless car market and provide shareholders the potential to beat the S&P 500 index over the long term. That leads me to NVIDIA.

The best self-driving car stock
A better option is NVIDIA, which is just as well-positioned in the driverless car market as Intel and Alphabet and has the room to see its top line soar. NVIDIA generated $6.9 billion in revenue in 2016 and it has the necessary expertise in developing a crucial piece of technology powering the brains of driverless cars -- the graphics processing unit (GPU). The GPU developer has been forming an impressive list of partnerships with several major automakers, including Volkswagen AG's Audi, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, Honda Motor Co, BMW, and Tesla among many others.
NVIDIA is even partnering with Baidu to develop automated parking, HD mapping, and advanced automated vehicle control.

NVIDIA has also signed agreements to supply its DRIVE PX 2 car computer to truckmaker PACCAR, as well as major auto suppliers such as ZF and Germany-based Bosch.
NVIDIA's revenue from its automotive segment totaled $487 million in fiscal 2017, which ended in late January. The graphics specialist is not a pure-play on self-driving cars, as the company is also selling graphics processors to video game enthusiasts and cloud computing providers, among other uses of its graphics technology. But given its relatively small amount of $6.9 billion in total revenue, the company will benefit shareholders much more from any future growth of self-driving cars compared to larger peers like Intel and Alphabet.

",The Best Stock to Buy in This Multibillion-Dollar Market
http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/05/02/when-should-you-start-saving-for-retirement.aspx,2017-05-02,"
The two most important requirements for major success are: first, being in the right place at the right time, and second, doing something about it. -- Ray Kroc, founder of McDonald's
Mr. Kroc was right. If you want financial security in your future, you need to start saving for retirement at the right time -- which is as soon as possible. The more you save, the bigger your withdrawals will be.

Image source: Getty Images.

Many people are not saving aggressively for their retirement, assuming incorrectly that it's too early or too late to do so. Let's take a look at both of those arguments and then review just what you can achieve. (Want to retire early? It might be more within your grasp than you think.) 
It's not too late to be saving for retirement
It's easy to assume that there's little point in saving for retirement if it's only a few years away and you haven't got much socked away and you're counting on Social Security. Go ahead and count on some Social Security income in your retirement, but it may be less than you expect, and it probably won't be enough to support you. 

Image source: Getty Images.

The average monthly Social Security retirement benefit was recently $1,364, which amounts to $16,368 per year. If your earnings have been above average, you'll collect more than that -- up to the maximum monthly Social Security benefit of $2,687 for those retiring at their full retirement age. (That's about $32,000 for the whole year.) See? It's not exactly a king's ransom. You can get a sense of how much to expect from Social Security via the Social Security Administration's online Retirement Estimator tool, and you can get an even clearer idea of your expected benefits by setting up a my Social Security account with the SSA.
Or maybe you're counting working as long as you can or holding a part-time job in retirement to supplement your Social Security with additional retirement income? That's a reasonable plan -- except that life's curveballs may get in the way. According to the 2017 Retirement Confidence Survey, 48% of retirees left the workplace sooner than they had planned to -- with 41% of them doing so because of health problems or disability, 26% citing company downsizings or closures, and 14% having to care for a spouse or other family member.
A better plan is to save aggressively beginning right now. Here's how much you might amass over several relatively brief time periods if your money grows by an annual average of 8%:

See? Even if you're only five years from retiring, you might be able to accumulate close to $100,000 if you (and perhaps your spouse) can manage annual investments of $15,000. (Note, of course, that while the stock market has averaged annual returns close to 10% over long periods, it can be quite volatile in shorter periods. You might average returns not of 8% but of 5% or even 15%. If interest rates were higher, you might accomplish more with bonds or savings accounts.
There are handy calculators online that can help with your retirement planning -- like this one, that shows you how much more you could accumulate by retirement by starting to save and invest now instead of later.

It's not too early to be saving for retirement
Meanwhile, according to a GenForward poll by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, more than 40% of Americans aged 25 to 30 have no retirement savings at all. Many of them may see little wrong with that -- after all, if you're 30, you probably have more than 30 years left before you retire. What's the rush?
That's very flawed reasoning, though, for several reasons. For starters, the more time your invested dollars have to grow, the more powerfully they can grow. Also, if you start young and are effective, you may be able to retire early! Check out the table below, which shows how much you might amass over several long periods with relatively modest investments if your money grows by an annual average of 8%:

If you're young, the table above can give you an idea of how early you might be able to retire. For example, if you're 30 now and can sock away $10,000 per year, you might have accumulated $1.2 million by the time you're 60 -- two full years before you're even eligible to start collecting Social Security. If you apply the 4% rule to that nest egg, it suggests that you can draw $48,000 from it in your first year of retirement.

Great wealth or early retirement are possible
The bottom line is that it's rarely too early or too late to start socking away money for retirement. The more you can save, the better -- and the earlier, the better, too, in order to give your dollars as much time as possible to grow. How should you invest your money? Well, if you expect to need it within five or perhaps even 10 years, don't keep it in stocks, as the stock market can be volatile over short periods. With long-term dollars, it's hard to beat stocks. You might simply use an inexpensive, broad-market index fund such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: SPY), which distributes your assets across 80% of the U.S. stock market and requires little expertise or oversight.
No matter how old you are, you can take steps today to make your financial future more secure.

Mattel's inventory challenge
Shares of toys and games giant Mattel plunged 13.6% following disappointing fiscal first-quarter earnings results in which sales fell 15% and net loss expanded to $113 million from $73 million in the prior-year period. The company endured a 13% slump in its core Barbie brand, and several other key franchises, including Fisher-Price and American Girl, posted hefty declines. Gross profit margin dove to 37.9% of sales from 44.7% a year ago.
Mattel blamed a glut of inventory left over from a weak holiday quarter in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe. ""Our Q1 results were below our expectations due to the retail inventory overhang coming out of the holiday period,"" CEO Margo Georgiadis said in a press release, ""but we remain encouraged by strong performance at retail for our key core brands ... as well as sustained momentum in high-growth markets like China.""
Executives said they are confident that most of the inventory challenge is behind them. The company is also looking forward to the boost it should get from its toy licensing deal with Disney around the entertainment giant's theatrical release of Cars 3 in June. Still, given the brutal start, 2017 seems set to be Mattel's fourth straight year of declining sales and profits.

Stanley Black & Decker's rising outlook
Stanley Black & Decker shares rose 3.7% following the release of the company's first-quarter earnings report. The tools specialist posted a 5% sales improvement to mark a healthy acceleration from the prior year's 4% gain. That translated into revenue of $2.81 billion, compared to consensus estimates targeting $2.75 billion. Stanley Black & Decker also beat expectations on profits as adjusted earnings rose to $1.29 per share; Wall Street would have settled for $1.20.

Management focused investors' attention on sales gains and the company's rising profitability. ""The first quarter was an excellent start to 2017,"" CEO James Loree said in a press release. ""We reported robust organic growth of 5% and a record 14.2% operating margin rate,"" he added.
Stanley Black & Decker is working on integrating the newly acquired Craftsman and Newell Tools businesses into operations while aiming to bring its elevated debt level back down starting next year. The good news for investors is that rising demand should make that process easier. Executives raised their organic growth outlook, and earnings are now projected to be between $7.95 and $8.15 per share, up from the $7.63 to $7.83 range the company issued in early March.

There are certain things you should look for in stocks you buy for your retirement portfolio. For example, steady and consistent profitability must be a priority, as should the ability to make it through tough economic times relatively unscathed. With that in mind, here are two excellent stocks you can use to build retirement wealth.
The monthly dividend company
Net-lease retail real estate investment trust Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) is a stock that works great before and after retirement. With a fantastic track record that includes 16.9% annualized total returns since its 1994 IPO and average dividend growth of 4.7% per year, Realty Income can certainly help you build retirement wealth.

Image source: Getty Images.

As you can see from the chart below, Realty Income has generated roughly five times the total return of the S&P 500. And with consistent monthly dividend payments (561 in a row), Realty Income can provide a steady income stream after you retire.

O Total Return Price data by YCharts.
Realty Income's primary property type is freestanding net-lease retail. Think of retail companies that tend to operate as the only tenants in their building -- Walgreens, Dollar General, and Wal-Mart are some good examples that are among Realty Income's top tenants. No tenant represents more than 7% of the company's rental revenue, and the properties are spread out across 49 states and Puerto Rico, reducing location-specific risks.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-97753');
            });
        


While many retailers are struggling, Realty Income's tenants aren't. Many are immune to e-commerce competition, and others are recession-resistant or even tend to do better in tough times. These tenants are also on long-term ""net"" leases, which means that they are responsible for property taxes, building maintenance, and insurance expenses.
In a nutshell, Realty Income just needs to put a tenant in place and enjoy years of consistent, predictably growing income, which is then passed along to shareholders. And with occupancy of 98.3%, which has never dropped below 96%, the company has been quite successful in doing just that.
You may have heard the phrase ""slow and steady wins the race,"" and Realty Income is a great example of this concept in practice. An investment in Realty Income is not going to make you rich in a month or two, but over several decades, this business model can produce massive returns.
Still the best big U.S. bank to invest in
It may seem strange that I'm suggesting Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) as a stock you can use to build retirement wealth, especially considering that the bank is still dealing with the fallout from its infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-90706');
            });
        


However, that's exactly why I think now is a good time to get in. Since news of the scandal broke, Wells Fargo has underperformed the banking sector by a wide margin -- about half, actually.

WFC Total Return Price data by YCharts.
This is certainly understandable, as the bank's numbers have definitely suffered a bit because of the scandal. During the first quarter, Wells Fargo reported a year-over-year 23% drop in mortgage originations, and posted an uncharacteristically high 62.7% efficiency ratio, which CEO Tim Sloan called ""not acceptable.""
While there is no telling how long the bank's numbers will suffer, I'm confident in saying that the post-scandal hit isn't likely to be permanent. For a long time now, Wells Fargo has consistently run a profitable and efficient banking operation, and has done it without taking unnecessary risks. This is why Wells Fargo emerged relatively unscathed from the financial crisis and why it's been able to grow so rapidly over the past few decades. And quite frankly, I don't see this well-defined long-term history of strong performance being permanently destroyed by the scandal.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-33231');
            });
        


As you can see, Wells Fargo produces superior profitability to rivals, on a consistent basis.

WFC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts.
In addition, Wells Fargo pays a best-in-class 2.8% dividend yield, and I wouldn't be surprised if the payout rises considerably in the years to come. In short, this is a rock-solid bank (despite the scandal), and now could be a smart time to add it to your long-term portfolio.

",2 Stocks to Help You Build Retirement Wealth
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/28/10-reasons-visa-could-be-the-worlds-most-perfect-s.aspx,2017-04-28,"
The average investor has more than 5,000 publicly traded stocks on reputable U.S. exchanges to choose from. With that many stalks of hay in the barn, finding that proverbial needle in the haystack can be quite difficult.
If you're looking for perhaps the world's most perfect stock, your search might end with payment processing giant Visa (NYSE:V). Since going public in March 2008, shares of Visa have risen by 467%, inclusive of its split in 2015. Despite this strong move higher, there are plenty of reasons to believe there's more left in the tank.
Here are 10 reasons Visa just might be the world's most perfect stock.

Image source: Visa.

1. A high barrier to entry in the industry 
Some of the best investments are those that offer competitive advantages. While Visa is certainly not free of competition, there aren't any surprising new entrants into the payment processing industry. The reason is that laying the infrastructure, getting the proper software in place, and building a merchant network, takes a lot of time and money. The exceptionally high costs of being involved in the payment facilitating industry means Visa has a pretty clear vision of who its competitors are and what it needs to do to stay on top.
2. No lending risk
Another factor that long-term investors are bound to like with Visa is that unlike peers American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), it's purely a payment facilitator and not a lender.
There are moments where I can imagine investors would prefer to see Visa lending money. When the economy is growing at a healthy pace and consumers are piling on debt with low delinquency rates, Discover and AmEx are able to double-dip by collecting the interest on loaned money, as well as the revenue from processing credit card transactions. But, Discover and AmEx also become exposed to rising delinquency rates if the U.S. or global economy falters, which can hurt their businesses via charge-offs.
Visa doesn't have to worry about this. It merely focuses on being the transaction middleman, which means it can probably withstand recessions far better than Discover or AmEx.

            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-66802');
            });
        

3. Top-tier U.S. market share 
According to data from WalletHub, Visa's U.S. credit card market share by network purchase volume has grown throughout the years. In 2006, Visa's market share was 42.5%, which was more than 13% ahead of its next-closest rival, MasterCard (NYSE:MA). By 2016, Visa's market share has risen to 50.6%, which is more than double the next-closest competitor, AmEx, which is at 22.9%.
Visa also has 328 million credit cards in circulation in the United States, which is actually more than MasterCard (192 million), American Express (57.6 million), and Discover (58 million) added together!
What this all means is that Visa has clear-cut market share advantages, and it's the top branded payment processing network among merchants. Translation: you'll sleep well at night because Visa is primed to be the leading credit card network for years to come.
4. Geographically diverse revenue stream
It's no secret that Visa relies on developed countries to provide the bulk of its revenue and profits, but the company today operates in more than 200 countries worldwide. This means that if the U.S., or any major developed country, enters a recession, Visa may be able to hedge its downside by leaning on purchasing dollar growth in emerging market countries which may be unaffected by a global slowdown. Africa, Southeastern Asia, and the Middle East could play a big role for Visa's growth in the decades to come.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-16432');
            });
        

5. A multi-platform company 
Visa is, and will continue to be, best known for facilitating credit card transactions. However, the company is no longer bound by plastic. Visa's services can be seen with point-of-sale tablets, laptops, and mobile devices. Visa's investments in next-generation technologies should do well to appeal to a younger generation of shoppers who strongly value convenience and their time, as well as solidify its dominant market share.
6. Inorganic growth 
Long-term investors will also probably appreciate Visa's preference for organic growth via network expansion. Over time, global GDP is on the rise, which means that if Visa can expand its network to more merchants, it should be able to reap the rewards of steady global growth.
But, Visa has also been known, on rarer occasions, to supplement its growth through acquisitions. Perhaps its most notable purchase came this past June when it completed its buyout of Visa Europe. The deal increased its merchant reach to 40 million, boosted its cards in worldwide circulation to around 3 billion, and brought its global payments volume to roughly $6.8 trillion annually. The innovation, scale, and added profits that Visa Europe brings to the table makes Visa all the more attractive.

                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-46050');
            });
        

7. Partnerships and collaborations 
Of course, Visa doesn't have to be acquiring businesses to make waves. Visa has also been an active partner and collaborator when it comes to next-generation payment processing tools and services. For example, in July Visa and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) announced a strategic partnership that allows Visa debit customers to move money instantly on PayPal and Venmo accounts. In return, PayPal receives incentives for increased Visa card spending volumes.
Another good example is Visa's partnership with IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Watson. The idea behind this collaboration is that Visa may be able to use IBM Watson's Internet of Things (IoT) platform to reach thousands of IoT client companies. For instance, USA Today describes an instance where a sensor in a car might alert the driver when it's time for replacement, allowing the driver the ability to complete the order of the part using their car's dashboard.
Partnerships like PayPal and IBM Watson give Visa new channels with which to reach consumers and boost engagement.
8. Low-yield environment 
The low interest rate environment has also been a long-term positive for Visa. Remember, the federal funds target rate has an impact on a number interest-bearing assets and services, including credit cards. The longer the Federal Reserve keeps its federal funds target rate below its historic average, the more likely consumers are to use their credit cards.
Interestingly enough, though, the average credit card APR hit an all-time high in March, which is probably a result of lenders getting more aggressive with their interest rates since lending rates having been stuck near record-lows for so many years. Long story short, as long as the Fed continues to walk on eggshells, Visa will likely benefit.

9. Shareholder yield 
Visa may not have the most robust dividend in the financial sector, but that doesn't mean it's not thinking of its shareholders when it's raking in the cash. Just this past week, Visa announced a $5 billion share repurchase agreement with the release of its second-quarter earnings results. This isn't the first time Visa has laid out plans to repurchase $5 billion of its common stock, either. It did so in Oct. 2014 as well.
In addition, Visa's quarterly payout has doubled from $0.0825 a quarter in Aug. 2013 to $0.165 per quarter today. Though this only translates to a 0.7% yield, Visa has demonstrated it has the cash flow and profits to significantly increase this payout if it chooses to.
10. A reasonably attractive valuation 
Finally, Visa is still valued attractively, even if its forward P/E of 23 is higher than that of the S&P 500. Unlike the average growth rate of the S&P 500, Visa has been able to continually grow its top-line by roughly 10% per year, and it's likely going to continue growing at 10%, if not better, for the near future. Its PEG ratio of less than 1.7 signifies a company that may still be inexpensive.
Between its international expansion opportunities, its dominant market share, and its next-gen collaborations, Visa very well could be the world's most perfect stock.

Q: One of my companies just missed earnings and revenue expectations. Is it time to sell my shares?
The short answer: no. Just because a company's quarterly earnings didn't meet analysts' expectations doesn't automatically mean that you should sell the stock.
Don't get me wrong -- the ""headline"" numbers of earnings per share (EPS) and revenue are certainly important. However, you should look at the factors affecting those numbers to determine if you should sell.
As an example, one stock I own in my portfolio is Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which just posted a rare earnings and revenue miss. The main culprit was a drop in trading revenue, which spooked investors because many of Goldman's peers reported stronger numbers in that area.
However, a closer look shows me that my reasons for owning Goldman -- my investing thesis -- still apply. Specifically:

Goldman maintained its No. 1 positions in announced mergers and acquisitions, as well as in equity and common stock offerings so far in 2017.
Goldman's investing and lending revenue grew to its highest level in four years.
The company's management did a good job of controlling expenses. Despite 27% year-over-year revenue growth, Goldman's total expenses grew by just 15%.
Goldman announced a 15% dividend increase, as well as the authorization to repurchase 50 million of its shares, an aggressive return of capital to shareholders.

In a nutshell, you should sell a stock because your reasons for believing in it as a long-term investment no longer apply, not because it missed earnings estimates by a few cents. For example, if Goldman had reported that it was losing market share, or expenses were getting out of hand, I might have re-evaluated my investment. As long as the long-term positives still apply, you should look at an earnings miss as an opportunity to add shares at a discount, not as a reason to sell.

Equally weighted funds attract investors' attention because a number of them are well-known as market beaters. Over the last 10 years, the returns of funds like Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF have beaten the standard S&P 500 index fund by about 0.50% per year, despite having higher fees than ordinary index funds.
But the reason for their out-performance may not be as complex as you might think. In fact, much of it can be attributed to the funds' higher-than-average risks.
In this segment of Industry Focus: Financials, The Motley Fool's Gaby Lapera and Jordan Wathen discuss the differences between equally weighted funds and classic market-cap weighted funds.
A full transcript follows the video.



This podcast was recorded on March 20, 2017.

            });
        


Gaby Lapera: Our first question comes from Rob. He writes, ""Recently, I have been reading about equal weight index funds as compared to the standard capital weighted funds."" Example: RSP (NYSEMKT:RSP) vs. SPY (NYSEMKT:SPY). ""Can you explore these equal-weight funds in depth, please?"" So, why don't we start with explaining what the difference is between those two types of funds.
Jordan Wathen: I think the big difference is that -- there's really two differences, but one of the big ones is the standard is market cap weighted, as he alluded to, which means that the largest companies make up the largest part of the index. So, for something like the S&P 500, the largest holdings, in order, are Apple, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson. Three out of 500 companies, those three, make about 8% of the S&P 500.
Lapera: That's incredible.
Wathen: If you look at an equally weighted index, it means that all of those are treated equally. So, those three, instead of making up 8% of the index, would make up 0.6% of the index.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-48081');
            });
        


Lapera: That makes sense. That would mean that in equal weighted funds, smaller cap companies make up a larger percentage of the companies represented.
Wathen: Right. If you look at it, you would say the big difference between them is that the market cap weighted funds, the standard funds, are biased toward the largest stocks, whereas equally weighted funds are more biased toward the smaller stocks. In a traditional S&P 500 funds, the standard fund, it invests about 45% of its assets in giant companies, or, super-large-cap companies. An equally weighted fund would only have about 12% of its assets in those companies. So, you can see, an equally weighted fund is way less reliant on the big 10 or 20 companies that make up the index.
Lapera: Yeah, and I'm sure there's pros and cons to each.
Wathen: A standard S&P fund, the second big difference between these two is the industry difference. As I said before, the two largest components of the S&P 500 are Apple and Microsoft, two huge tech giants. If you look at an equally weighted index, tech only makes up about 12% of assets. But in a standard S&P 500, it makes up about 18% of assets. So, there's a size difference, and there's also the industry difference between the two funds.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-2762');
            });
        


Lapera: Yeah. So, maybe if you're looking to be really heavily invested in tech and big companies, the standard market cap weighted one might be for you. But if you're looking to be a little bit more diverse in your interests, maybe be equally weighted one is for you.
Wathen: Right. I think what gets people interested in this is that over long spans of periods of time, the equally weighted one will probably outperform because it has exposure to small and mid-cap companies, which typically outperform larger caps. But, obviously, that outperformance comes with more volatility. You're going to have to deal with greater losses in a year where the S&P 500 is down.
Lapera: Yeah. And the reason that the small and mid-caps tend to outperform the large caps over the long term is because the small and mid-caps have room to grow, whereas the super-long mega-giant-caps that make up a lot of the market cap weighted ones don't have as much space to grow, so it's getting harder and harder for them to outperform their performance from last year.
Wathen: Just look at Apple, for example. If you look at Apple, by assets, a lot of it is just cash. And obviously, cash isn't going to beat stocks in the long haul. So, intuitively, it makes sense that a lot of these largest companies that derive a lot of their value from earnings years ago aren't going to outperform the companies that will outperform on the basis of earnings going forward.

Gathering enough cash for a down payment on a house can be a daunting task. If you haven't saved for at least a couple years, you could have trouble qualifying for a mortgage. And even if you do, the interest rates can be prohibitive.
Luckily, there's a loophole in how IRAs are structured that can relieve some of this pressure. Indeed, if you are pulling money out of a Roth IRA, you can likely do so and pay no tax at all. And while you'd still owe taxes on an early Traditional IRA withdrawal, you can avoid the 10% penalty.
Read on for details.

Using retirement money for a house? Isn't that a bad idea?
As far as home buying is concerned, I am what you might consider a Perma-Bear here at The Motley Fool. The folks at Zillow have even taken note. While I understand the benefits of owning rental property, when it comes to buying a house for yourself, I considered it one of the most over-rated financial moves ever.
That's because we don't really understand that we don't own equity in the house, the bank does. We aren't really paying principal at the beginning; we're paying interest (aka ""rent""). And the down payment isn't a great investment; it often trails the S&P 500 by an order of magnitude.
All of this leads to today's reality: I am a homeowner! Upon starting a family and wanting stability for our daughter, my wife and I took the plunge -- albeit a decade later than most of our friends. But we didn't do it for financial reasons; rather, it was for social and emotional ones.
Because we weren't interested in buying a home, we didn't save up for a down payment. And yet, because of a loophole in IRAs, we had no problem making the payment.
Using a Roth IRA loophole for home purchases
There are two ways that you can use money socked away in a Roth for a home purchase.
The good news is that you'll likely owe absolutely no taxes. That's because before putting your money into a Roth, you already paid taxes on the cash you earned.
The first provision is if you classify your withdrawal as related to a first-time home purchase. All of the money you pull out is tax-free, if:

The account has been open at least 5 years.
You are pulling out $10,000 or less (per person).
All funds go directly toward purchasing your first home -- which includes the down payment and closing costs, among other things.

But Roths also allow for early withdrawals that aren't designated as being for a home as well. Because you have already paid taxes on the money you put in, you can withdraw it tax-free. But there is an important caveat: you can only withdraw the principal.
In other words, if you put $20,000 into your Roth over the years, and it has grown to $50,000, you can only take out the original $20,000 without having to pay the penalty.
That opens up another loophole: if you need more than $10,000 for your down payment, you can combine both of these strategies: taking out $10,000 from the account and calling that part of your gains, and taking out an amount equal to or less than the principal you put in.
This is how we paid for our down payment. And because we've been avid savers and frugal spenders, our retirement accounts are still plenty healthy.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-59848');
            });
        

A less enticing option: using your Traditional IRA
If you don't have a Roth, or don't have enough in one, you can also use a loophole to let you take money out of your Traditional IRA without paying a penalty. That's because the Traditional IRA also allows for the same $10,000 withdrawals for the first-time purchase of a home.
But there's a big catch here: you didn't pay taxes on that money when you put it in, so you'll likely owe Uncle Sam a pretty penny. Making matters worse, because these withdrawals tend to be rather large, they can significantly increase your tax burden, depending on your bracket.
That's why, all things being equal, a Roth is a much better vehicle to use.
Skeptics have a point, but remember what money is for in the first place
Some might think it (small f) foolish to pull money out of a retirement account for a down payment. Often times, I count myself among those skeptics. That's because once you pull money out of a Roth or Traditional IRA, you're not only losing that money from your retirement account, but all of the tax-advantaged growth that goes along with it. The younger you are, the more you're losing.
Here's our example: my wife and I pulled out a combined $25,000. But when retirement time hits in 30 years, we'll be missing much more than $25,000 -- it will be more like a $250,000 hit. That's because we're missing out on 30 years of tax-advantaged growth of about 8% per year, depending on how you want to extrapolate historical returns.
But we need to remember what our overarching goals are for money -- and those are different for everyone. We want our daughter to grow up in a safe, stable, and diverse community. And extra $250,000 in our coffers at retirement time isn't going to do that.,
That's why it's important to remember that money should be used as a tool to help you enjoy the life you want to live. If owning a home -- for financial, social, emotional, health, etc. reasons -- is what you desire, and you understand the long-term trade-offs of lost growth from your retirement accounts, then it's a smart move to make.

Keeping a portion of your portfolio dedicated to stocks of solid, dividend-paying companies is a wise strategy for building wealth for the long term while maintaining some relative safety. Stocks of large pharmaceutical companies come into favor in times of economic uncertainty because of their ability to maintain margins and typically healthy cash flows during downturns. Does pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK) merit a spot in a conservative dividend portfolio?
A solid, but not stellar dividend history
Merck, with its current 3% yield, has proved itself a company that makes shareholder returns a high priority, having paid a dividend continuously without ever cutting it since at least 1970. The dividend has grown at an annualized rate of 3.6% since 2010 -- well ahead of inflation -- but was flat from 2004 to 2010.

Image source: Getty Images.

In recent years the company has also been returning capital to stockholders in the form of share buybacks, having reduced the number of shares outstanding at an annualized rate of 2.5% over the last four years. The total shareholder yield -- dividends plus buybacks -- of 5.5% is a very healthy rate in today's environment of low interest rates.
There is no guarantee that buybacks will continue over the long term, but they are a good indication that the company can meet its needs for growth investments and dividend payments with substantial cash left over.
A sustainable dividend
One measure of the sustainability of dividends payouts is the payout ratio, which is the percentage of the company's GAAP net profit that is being paid out in dividends. 
The payout ratio should ideally be no more than about 60%, Merck's dividend looks a little risky in that for the last two years, it's paid out more in dividends than it has made in profit. However, the company has had a lot of non-cash charges related to acquisitions, and when the dividends payments are compared to free cash flow, the situation looks much better. It appears the company is having no trouble paying dividends from its cash, giving us some confidence that it can continue to do so in the future.

Growth prospects are improving
Growth has been a challenge for Merck in the last few years, as generic competition has eaten away at sales and the company has had some major missteps with its drug development program. 2016 revenue grew 3% before currency exchange losses, and the company is guiding to a gain of only 1% excluding currency in 2017. Patent expirations are affecting Merck's blockbuster drugs Cubicin, Nasonex, Zetia, and Remicade, and will soon be taking a big chunk out of Vytorin. Adding to its own woes, the company had a surprising number of expected blockbuster drugs fail in late stage trials in recent years. Rolofylline, vorapaxar, telcagepant, tredaptive, and odanacatib are all drugs you'll never hear of but represent billions of lost investment and future sales.
Fortunately the company has had just enough successes -- and cost-cutting -- to make up for the losses, keeping dividend payments coming and the stock price rising. The stock price has appreciated at an annualized rate of 9.5% over the last four years, giving dividend investors a very nice total return. Recently launched blockbuster drugs Januvia for diabetes, Isentress for HIV, Zepatier for hepatitis C, and the Gardasil vaccine for HPV have helped maintain growth, but the big news for growth going forward is Keytruda.
Keytruda is a PD-1 inhibitor drug for fighting various types of cancer that Merck first launched in 2014 for metastatic melanoma and has since been approved for head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. The latter approval was a huge win for Merck, in that it took the valuable first line treatment position over Bristol-Myers Squibb's megablockbuster Opdivo. The contrast between results for Opdivo and Keytruda opens up the possibility that Keytruda is actually a better molecule than Bristol's, which is currently selling at a rate of over a $1 billion per quarter. The drug has huge potential to be used for a wide variety of cancers, and is currently being tested in over 400 different studies. With three expected approval dates coming up in the first half of 2017 alone, the drug will help Merck overcome its weak spots this year and turn up the growth in future years.
A solid pick
There are companies that have a stronger history of growth, both in the dividend and in earnings. But Merck's payout is likely secure, its growth prospects are improving, and it sells for 16 times its 2017 earnings -- less than the average stock in the S&P 500. For conservative, long-term investors, Merck could be good medicine for an income portfolio.

Leading self-storage real estate investment trust Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) may not seem like the most exciting stock to you, and that's understandable. After all, what business is less interesting than warehouse-like buildings where people lock up their extra stuff? However, the returns generated by this self-storage giant have been anything but boring over the past several decades. And after a 14% drop in the share price over the past year, now might be a great time to add it to your portfolio.
Public Storage: Millionaire maker?
At first it may seem odd to refer to Public Storage as a ""millionaire maker"" stock. Typically, that title and similar ones are used in connection with stocks that have doubled, tripled, or more in short periods of time, which Public Storage is more of a slow and steady type of growth story.

Image source: Getty Images.

However, when you take a look at the company's track record of performance, the millionaire-market label makes a lot of sense. As you can see in the chart below, the stock has produced a remarkable 6,880% total return over the past three decades (15.2% annualized)  roughly six times the S&P 500's return over the same time period.

PSA Total Return Price data by YCharts.
To put this level of performance into perspective, consider that every $14,325 invested in Public Storage 30 years ago would be worth $1 million today. Who says ""boring"" businesses can't make you rich?
About Public Storage and why its business is so lucrative
Most people are at least familiar with Public Storage from a consumer's point of view. As the clear leader in the self-storage industry, Public Storage's recognizable orange storage buildings are all over the U.S. At the end of the first quarter, the company owned 2,354 storage facilities in 38 states and over 200 more in Europe, with a total of about 155 million rentable square feet of space. It is the dominant self-storage operator in several high-growth markets, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle.
By nature, the self-storage business is attractive from a cost perspective. Specifically, self-storage buildings tend to have lower operating expenses and turnover costs than other types of real estate. In fact, Public Storage has previously said that its facilities only need about 30% occupancy to break even, and they are currently more than 90% full. Public Storage's leading market share gives it cost and efficiency advantages over competitors, and its strong, well-recognized brand name gives it higher pricing power.
The company's goal is to sustainably grow its business, while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet. The company has historically avoided taking on any debt at all, but has modified that strategy over in recent years, as interest rates fell to historic lows and became too attractive to ignore.
Public Storage grows through acquisitions, but in recent years has started to develop new facilities from the ground up, which can provide a boost to shareholder value. Think of it this way: If it costs Public Storage $10 million to acquire a storage facility of a certain size but only $8 million to build it, not only does this create $2 million in instant value but it also results in a greater return on invested capital. Of course, this is a simplified example, but in the real world, developments have the potential to create significant value for investors. In fact, the company estimates that developments produce ROIC that are 2%-3% higher than acquisitions.
The company's results prove that the business model is successful. Over the past 10 years, Public Storage has produced annualized 10% free cash flow growth and 9% core FFO growth. Shareholders have been rewarded with dividends that have grown by an average of 14% per year.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-62188');
            });
        

Recent results have been mixed
To be fair, Public Storage's first-quarter earnings report wasn't exactly stellar, which is why the stock dropped 4% in reaction to the quarterly results. The company's funds from operations (FFO) -- the REIT version of earnings -- missed estimates by $0.05, and same-store occupancy declined by 0.5% year over year.
Even so, most of the recent data still looks strong from a long-term investment perspective. Although it missed estimates, the first-quarter FFO represented a 11.4% increase over last year. And same-store revenue grew faster than expenses, despite the decreased occupancy rate, which was still an incredibly strong 93.1%.
Risks to be aware of
No stock capable of the returns Public Storage has generated over the years is without risk, so it's important to be aware of these before jumping in.
One big risk factor that all REITs face is interest rate risk. Without going into a long explanation, rising interest rates are generally bad for high-dividend stocks, such as REITs like Public Storage. Interest rates are expected to rise gradually over the next few years, and I believe that the current expectations are priced into the stock (one reason why it's down over the past year). However, be aware that if rates rise faster than expected, the stock could certainly drop.
Also, note that the self-storage business is not a defensive type of real estate. In other words, it tends to do very well when the economy is strong, but also tends to suffer in tough times. Not only is self-storage a somewhat discretionary purchase  in tough times, people are more inclined to ""find room"" for their extra stuff somewhere else -- but self-storage facilities generally lease their space on a month-to-month basis, making it easy for cash-strapped tenants to vacate. Public Storage has high occupancy now, but it could certainly take a hit in a recession.

The Foolish bottom line
While it isn't without risk, Public Storage has a fantastic track record of responsibly growing its business and delivering excellent returns in a variety of economic climates. The stock's performance has taken a breather -- down 14% over the past year -- so now may be a good time to consider Public Storage for your long-term portfolio.

3D Systems(NYSE:DDD) is slated to report its first-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, May 3. It's on track to be the first of the two leading diversified 3D printing companies to report, as prime rival Stratasys is scheduled to report on May 16.
This will be the fourth quarterly report that covers a period for which Vyomesh Joshi has been CEO, as he was hired in April 2016.
Shares of 3D Systems are up 19.1% in 2017 but are down 14.7% for the one-year period through April 28. For context, shares of Stratasys are up 49.6% in 2017, and in the red 8.7% over the same one-year period. The S&P 500 has returned 7.2% and 16.3%, respectively, in 2017 and over the last year.
Benchmark quarterly numbers
Here are the year-ago quarterly results to use as benchmarks.

Revenue
$152.6 million


Adjusted earnings per share (EPS)
$0.05



Data source: 3D Systems.
To provide some context -- though investors shouldn't give much weight to Wall Street's short-term estimates -- analysts expect 3D Systems to deliver adjusted EPS of $0.11 on revenue of $156.3 million, representing year-over-year growth of 120% and 2.4%, respectively.
Along with the headline numbers, here's what to focus on in the report.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. Revenue from sales of 3D printers
Investors' primary focus, in my opinion, should be on the revenue 3D Systems generated in the quarter from sales of 3D printers, which the company has traditionally broken out from its broader product category sales. We'd obviously like to see an improvement on this front.
For full-year 2016, 3D Systems' 3D printer revenue declined 21% from 2015, though this number is somewhat overstated with respect to the company's current business because 2015 revenue includes sales of consumer 3D printers, which have since been discontinued. Unfortunately, we don't know the year-over-year change in 3D printer revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016, which could be used as a sequential benchmark. 3D Systems did not provide this number last quarter; it simply provided the full-year change. We do now that in the first quarter of 2016, printer revenue declined 24% year over year, or 17% excluding consumer printers.  In the second quarter, printer revenue declined 30%,  and in the third quarter, printer revenue declined 6%  to $33 million.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-52248');
            });
        

2. Healthcare business performance
3D Systems' healthcare business, which includes both products and services, has generally been a bright spot amid what's proved to be challenging overall 3D printing market conditions since 2015. We'd like to see this revenue growth driver continue to chug along. (The company only breaks out revenue, not operating income or any form of earnings.)
As for benchmarks, the healthcare business' year-over-year revenue increased 12%, 11%, and 23% in the first, second, and third quarters of 2016, respectively, and 5% in full-year 2016.  As with 3D printer revenue, 3D Systems did not break out the year-over-year revenue change in the fourth quarter of last year. However, it's obvious from the numbers we do have that the healthcare business performed poorly in the fourth quarter.
One thing investors should keep in mind is that healthcare revenue and total revenue will get a boost from the company's January acquisition of NextDent's portfolio of 12 dental materials, which have regulatory approvals in numerous countries.  Ideally, 3D Systems will also provide an organic growth rate for its healthcare business, stripping out the revenue contribution that this acquisition made in the first quarter, so we can compare apples to apples. (Organic growth is growth in businesses owned for at least one year.)
3. Interest in Figure 4
Hopefully, management will provide some information on the conference call about interest in Figure 4, which is 3D Systems' next-generation technology designed for the production of plastic parts. Figure 4 is a robotic, modular stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing system that the company claims is up to 50 times faster than conventional SLA 3D printing systems. 
For background, 3D Systems introduced Figure 4 in early 2016, demonstrated it at a major industry trade show in the fall, and announced in March that it had recently shipped its first system to an unnamed ""Fortune 50 industrial customer."" At the same time, the company also unveiled a Figure 4 platform designed for dental applications, which it expects to be available for delivery this fall.

And the metals business?
Like many investors, I'd like to know how 3D Systems' metals business is performing, but I don't think the company will release this data. Hopefully, management share a little color on the earnings call about this business.
My guess -- and this is an educated guess only -- is that revenue in the metals business has stagnated at best since the company ceased breaking out the performance of this business. What we do know is that in 2014, the metals business accounted for about 6% of 3D Systems' total revenue.

Income investors naturally gravitate toward stocks that offer up the highest yields. But not every stock with a fat payout is an automatic buy. In fact, stocks with big yields are often quite risky, which is why income investors need to be choosy about which stocks they buy.

Knowing that, let's take a closer look at the 10 highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500 to see if any of them could be worth owning.

Is the payout sustainable?
The first metric I like to look at when I'm evaluating a dividend stock is the payout ratio. This ratio can be found by dividing a company's annual dividend payment by its last four quarters of earnings. The resulting figure will give an investor a quick glance at how much of a company's profits are being consumed by the dividend. In general, any number above 80% is a yellow flag, and a payout ratio over 100% hints that trouble could be brewing.
Here's what this ratio looks like for each of the 10 companies

Occidental Petroleum

AT&T

Table source: Yahoo! Finance. NM = not meaningful; these companies reported losses over the past 12 months.
Right off the bat, we can eliminate several of these companies from consideration. Both Frontier Communications and Occidental Petroleum haven't even reported a profit over the past four quarters, which is why neither has a payout ratio. That's a good enough reason to give them a pass.
CenturyLink, Mattel, and Seagate Technology all have payout ratios that exceed 100%. That means the dividend checks they're sending off to investors exceed their net income. That's not a recipe for long-term sustainability, which makes me believe they should be avoided as well.
Are they growing? 
The five remaining companies all look as if they can afford their dividend payment for the time being. Next, I like to get a sense of a company's growth potential. My reasoning is that an income stock must be able to increase its dividend payment over time to be considered attractive. You can't do that unless you also have a growing profit stream. 
To get a rough idea of a company's growth potential, I like to look at a company's historical earnings growth rate and its projected future profit growth rate over five-year periods of time.
Here's what these metrics look like for our five remaining companies:



Company

Actual Earnings Growth Over Past 5 Years

Estimated Earnings Growth Over Next 5 Years





Ford 

5.6%

2.9%




Macy's 


(3.7%)


18.6%




Kohl's


(3%)


8.6%




Staples

AT&T

7.4%




Data source: Yahoo! Finance.
This data shows that the past five years haven't been kind to big-box retailers such as Macy's, Kohl's, and Staples. That's because the entire retail sector has been under pressure as a result of increased competition from e-commerce companies such as Amazon.com. Each of these companies is responding to the pressure by closing stores and investing in their own e-commerce capabilities.
Will these tactics drive long-term profit growth? That's still unclear, but Wall Street believes that Macy's and Kohl's will be successful and drive solid earnings growth over the next few years. If so, then both companies could turn into fine investments. By contrast, Staples' bottom line has taken a much bigger beating over the past five years, and market watchers are barely expecting any growth at all from here. Steering clear is likely to be the right call here.
As for Ford, the company's modest payout ratio suggests that its dividend is easily sustainable. However, investors need to keep in mind that auto sales are highly cyclical. That's why it might be a mistake to place too much emphasis on a single year's earnings results. In addition, there are signs that auto sales have peaked in North America, which, if true, could spell doom for Ford's near-term profit potential. Analysts appear to have accounted for that threat by forecasting only 2.9% profit growth from here. That's not an attractive enough growth rate to warrant an investment, in my book.
Finally, AT&T has proved itself to be a steady-Eddy giant that consistently cranks out profit growth each and every year. That trend should continue, since AT&T maintains a strong competitive position in the U.S. wireless space and it recently acquired DirecTV. Its pending merger with Time Warner could also be a win for shareholders if it gets the green light from regulators. While investors need to keep a watchful eye on the company's high payout ratio, a growing stream of profits should help to ensure that its dividend remains safe.

            });
        

Are any worth buying?
While I'd hesitate to call any of these stocks a screaming buy right now, I must say that my favorite names from this list are Kohl's, Macy's, and AT&T. All three offer investors a sustainable dividend yield and a shot at posting profit growth over the next five years. That's a compelling combination.

Financial stocks led the way up, and that allowed the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) to beat the broader market by a wide margin with a 1.7% increase. Gold prices held steady, which didn't stop Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:JNUG) -- the volatile leveraged bullish bet on the precious metal -- from falling 2.5%.
As for individual stocks, American Express (NYSE:AXP) and CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) both beat the market following quarterly earnings news.

Image source: Getty Images.

American Express sees momentum
American Express shares gained almost 6% after first-quarter results pointed to a building rebound in the credit services giant's business. As expected, the loss of the co-branded partnership with Costco continued to weigh on the company's headline numbers. The U.S. consumer segment logged an 8% sales decline, in fact, and endured a 32% slump in operating profit. That pinch led to a 13% overall earnings dip as revenue ticked down by 2%.
However, American Express managed a healthy expansion after excluding the Costco losses. Adjusted revenue grew 7% to mark an uptick over the prior quarter's 6% pace. Adjusted card member spending bounced 8% higher, loans were up 11%, and the company added 2.6 million new cards across its global network.
Executives were pleased with the results. ""Our first quarter performance marks a good start to the year,"" CEO Kenneth Chenault said in a press release, ""with momentum in the consumer and commercial businesses in the U.S. and in key markets internationally.""
Looking ahead, investors can expect the company to invest in marketing and promotions in a bid to accelerate sales gains back toward overall growth. The company's 2017 forecast projected earnings of $5.60 to $5.80 per share, with the midpoint of that guidance falling just ahead of the $5.65 per share that Wall Street had been targeting.

            });
        

CSX boasts big sales gains
CSX stock jumped 5.6% after the railroad titan announced surprisingly strong first-quarter results. Sales spiked nearly 10% to $2.87 billion, which put the company well ahead of consensus estimates of just $2.76 billion. Earnings also came in above estimates at $0.51 per share compared to the $0.43 per share Wall Street was expecting. The growth came from a healthy mix of volume gains and higher pricing, with the biggest increase tied to its coal segment, which saw revenue spike by 31%.

Incoming CEO E. Hunter Harrison expressed optimism that he's settling into the leadership spot at an opportune time for the business: ""I am pleased to join the CSX team and working together we are going to make this company the best North American railroad, capable of consistently meeting and exceeding the expectations of our customers and our shareholders,"" he said.
Executives forecast continued growth ahead thanks to a strengthening outlook in key industries like minerals, forest products, and agriculture that should more than offset flat results in the automotive sector and losses in the local coal market. Looking further out, CSX is aiming to make operating and efficiency upgrades that improve service, lower costs, expand margins, and boost earnings over the long term.
",What Happened in the Stock Market Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/26/3-biggest-opportunities-for-walt-disney-co.aspx,2017-04-26,"
Kids of all ages have loved Walt Disney's (NYSE:DIS) iconic movies, theme parks, and other offerings for generations -- and there's no reason to believe that this won't continue. Investors have been sharing in the fun, too, as Disney's stock has returned 270% vs. the S&P 500's 96.3% over the 10-year period through April 21. 
Most investors are likely quite aware that Disney's movie-making business is firing on all cylinders across its brands -- from Star Wars and Disney to Marvel and Pixar -- and that this should continue given its impressive movie slate for the next few years, which includes several more Star Wars films. So, we're going to focus on three other big (and related to varying degrees) opportunities. 

Image source: Disney.

1. China 
Last June, Disney opened the massive $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney, its first park in mainland China. The park has huge growth potential given how new it is. Moreover, the park can be viewed as a gateway into the Chinese market. This is a delectable market because China's population of about 1.4 billion makes it the most populous country in the world and because the country's middle class is rapidly increasing.
From its opening through the company's first-quarter earnings call in early February, the park has totaled more than 7 million visits, with CEO Bob Iger predicting that attendance could exceed 10 million by the park's one-year anniversary. (Investors will get an update soon, as Disney is scheduled to report its Q2 earnings on May 9.) What's remarkable is that the park is expected to come very close to breaking even during fiscal year 2017, which ends in October. So investors should be able to bank on the park adding to Disney's earnings in fiscal 2018 and beyond. 
As to the park acting as a gateway, Iger has said several times that the company believes the success of Shanghai Disney will open the door to additional opportunities in Shanghai and around China.
2. Video streaming 
Last August, Disney announced that it was plunking down $1 billion to acquire a 33% stake in BAMTech, a leading video streaming company formed by Major League Baseball. It has the option to buy a controlling stake in the future. 
The main benefit of the BAMTech stake is that it provides the entertainment giant with the capability to bring its TV shows, movies, and other media directly to consumers via subscription video streaming services. This is critical in light of the steadily declining subscriber counts for Disney's lucrative ESPN and other cable properties due to the industrywide trends of cable cord-cutting and cord-slimming. As of the last earnings call, the company still plans to launch in 2017 a direct-to-consumer ESPN-branded multisport subscription video streaming service with unique ESPN cable content. 
A secondary benefit of the BAMTech stake is that it should allow Disney to eventually profit from the popularity of streaming in general. BAMTech already has some big-name clients across industries and Disney's investment should help it grow and improve its platform.

            });
        

3. Virtual reality 
Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are still quite nascent technologies. VR in particular is widely expected to explode in the not-too-distance future. Several big tech companies have entered the space in the last few years, including Alphabet, Sony, and Facebook, with devices that allow consumers to view VR content. Media companies are also getting into the action, as they'll bring VR content to the table (or, more aptly, to viewing devices). 
Given Disney's top tech chops, it's not surprising that Disney Research and Disney Imagineering (the group that designs and builds the company's theme parks, resorts, etc.) have for some time been exploring VR/AR, as well as just about every tech with massive growth potential. In September 2015, Disney ramped up its involvement in VR when it led a $66 million Series C investment round in Jaunt, which brought the start-up's total funding to $101 million. Jaunt's hardware, software, and other tools produce cinema-quality content in a 360-degree VR format.
It's only a matter of time before VR will be making notable inroads into Disney's various entertainment offerings starting with its movies and TV shows.

Momentum isn't everything on the stock market, but it's often helpful. Stock movements can be volatile, swinging back and forth, but companies tend to march higher on a series of positive earnings reports or similar good news.
There were no blowout stocks in April on the S&P 500, but several stocks managed to deliver big gains nonetheless. Here are the top three.

Image source: C.R. Bard.

#1. C.R. Bard 
Medical-device maker C.R. Bard (NYSE:BCR) shares are up 22.4% so far this month, but that jump came almost entirely on one day as the company agreed to be bought out just this Monday.  Shares jumped 19.5% during that session.
Bard announced it would be acquired by Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) for $24 billion in an all cash-and-stock deal in what's seen as a response to a series of hospital mergers. As purchasers of medical supplies have consolidated, their buying power has become more concentrated, making a tie-up between Bard and BD a way to balance out the negotiating power.  
Becton Dickinson said it expected the merger to boost its gross margins by 3 percentage points, which should provide a robust increase to earnings per share. Tim Ring, Bard CEO, said, ""We are confident that this combination will deliver meaningful benefits for customers and patients as we see opportunities to leverage BD's leadership."" The deal is expected to close this fall.

Image source: Motley Fool.

2. Whole Foods Market
Like C.R. Bard, Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) shares have soared on outsider interest, gaining 20.8% through April 25. Shares first begin surging on April 10 after activist hedge fund Jana Partners took a stake in the organic grocer with an eye on turning the business around or selling it to another company. Soon after, reports emerged that Amazon.com had considered making a play at Whole Foods in the fall, but decided not to pursue it. Still, the news indicated that there could be potential buyers for the natural grocery chain, which has seen six straight quarters of declining comparable sales.
On April 24, the stock gained again on news that privately owned Albertsons had held preliminary talks with lenders about making a potential offer for Whole Foods Market.
After the strong performance this month, the stock now trades at a P/E of 26, making it pricey for a buyout (which would add a further premium), especially since performance has struggled. If no buyer emerges over the next couple of months, the stock could return to the $30 range.

            });
        

3. Lam Research Corporation
Semiconductor maker Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) was the third-best performer through April 25 as the stock surged 7% after a strong earnings report on April 19. As of the 25th, shares had gained 12.8%. In the earnings report, Lam said shipments had increased 25% sequentially, and revenue jumped 64% from the quarter a year ago to $2.15 billion. Net income, meanwhile, more than quadrupled to $574.7 million.
The report helped spark a rally in semiconductor shares, and increasing demand for internet-of-things devices like connected-home gadgets have driven a boom in the sector. Lam shares have risen 81% over the last year, and look primed to keep gaining -- the company issued promising guidance for the current quarter, seeing $2.3 billion in revenue and $3 in earnings per share.
CEO Martin Anstice already said the company continues to ""perform extremely well,"" citing the company's ""broad competitive strengths."" With a modest valuation and earnings growth keeping pace with the recent stock price appreciation, shares look primed to continue moving higher. 

",3 Best Performing Stocks of April 
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/26/better-buy-home-depot-vs-lowes.aspx,2017-04-26,"
A growing housing market has sustained both Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), allowing each to post exceptional fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 earnings reports that handily beat analyst expectations across the board on revenue, profit, and comparable-store sales. But as we head into the spring home-buying season, clouds are forming on the horizon.
Mortgage rates are rising, there's a shortage of available housing to meet the demand, and new housing starts are dropping. That's a double-edged sword for the home-building supply warehouses because on one hand, they cater to the professional contractors building the homes, but on the other, do-it-yourselfers and home remodeling still comprise a big part of their business. Business from the one might fall, but it could rise from the other. 
With this changeable environment confronting the two biggest big-box stores in the home-improvement industry, let's see whether Home Depot or Lowe's makes for the better buy.

Image source: Lowe's. 

Growth prospects
Despite their apparent similarities, Home Depot is the bigger and more profitable of the two. While they have about the same number of stores in operation, Lowe's generates about a third less revenue, 60% less operating income, and half the free cash flow. That's because Home Depot tilts more toward the professional contractor -- who tend to buy higher value items -- while Lowe's leans more toward the homeowner.
With housing having enjoyed a really robust 2016, which has been called the best year in a decade for the market, it's understandable that Home Depot edges out its rival. Yet with the changes underway in the industry, the field might begin to tilt now in Lowe's favor.
Housing prices are rising, and with mortgage rates going up -- not to mention the number of homeowners still underwater on their mortgages -- moving on might not be an option for many. It will be tough to give up those lower rates homeowners have enjoyed, and with staying put comes the decision to fix up what you've got. The tides of renovation and remodeling will lift the boats of both Home Depot and Lowe's, but Lowe's business model specifically favors homeowners, meaning it may rise higher.

Lowe's leading position in appliances and fashion fixtures may help it edge out its rival in gains for those who can't or won't sell their homes.
Performance and valuation
The stocks of the two companies might not walk in lockstep, but they're still pretty similar. However, after Lowe's recent earnings report, the market rewarded it with a big surge higher that puts the one-year gains of both companies almost on par with each other.

HD data by YCharts.
On a trailing-12-month basis, both Home Depot and Lowe's are comparably valued at around 23 times earnings, but when looking out over the next 12 months, Lowe's gains an edge with its price at about 15 times next year's profits versus Home Depot's 18 times earnings, though both are attractively priced in relation to the S&P 500 as a whole at 26 times earnings.
Still, Lowe's is expected to grow earnings at a 15% annual clip over the next five years compared to less than 12% for Home Depot. With macroeconomic trends moving in its favor, Lowe's has the advantage, here.

            });
        

Dividends
Both companies have their strengths when returning value to shareholders through dividend payments. Home Depot, for example, pays a dividend of $3.56 per share annually, reflecting the big 29% hike in the payout it just approved for the year. It currently yields about 2.4%.
Lowe's dividend of $1.40 per share annually and yield of 1.7% seem much more mundane, but the DIY retailer has an impressive record of paying a dividend every year since it became a public company in 1961, as well as raising the payout every year for 54 straight years.
The verdict
Both companies have done well as housing finally recovered after the financial markets collapsed, and recent trends worked in favor of Home Depot's business. But things are changing once more -- and seeming to tilt in Lowe's favor now.
While both big-box retailers are likely to do well regardless, the economic variables and Lowe's lower and better valuation -- particularly in relation to its future earnings growth estimates -- make it the better choice, however slightly.

IBM keeps shrinking
Shares of IBM weighed heavily on the Dow, falling almost 5%. The tech titan posted declining operating results for its fiscal first quarter as sales dipped 2.8% to $18.2 billion and net income dove 13% to $1.75 billion. Increases in its cognitive solutions segment failed to offset shrinking figures at its other key business divisions.
Specifically, IBM logged a 2.1% uptick in cognitive solutions revenue but endured a 2.5% decrease in the tech services and cloud unit in addition to declines in consulting services and systems hardware and software.
Gross profit margin fell nearly 4 full percentage points to 42.8% of sales and free cash flow declined to $1.09 billion. However, aggressive cost cuts helped limit the drop in operating income to just 1%. Research and development spending ticked up to $1.53 billion from $1.46 billion a year ago.
In a press release, CEO Ginni Rometty focused on encouraging demand that management is seeing in pockets of their services portfolio. ""In the first quarter,"" Rometty said, ""both the IBM Cloud and our cognitive solutions again grew strongly, which fueled robust performance in our strategic imperatives.""
The company reaffirmed full-year guidance that calls for earnings of at least $11.95 per share. In the meantime, executives plan to continue plowing cash into strategic growth initiatives like cloud services and cognitive solutions to put the business back on the path to revenue growth.

Intuitive Surgical speeds up growth
Intuitive Surgical shares surged more than 6% to pass the $800 mark after the high-tech medical instrument specialist announced solid quarterly earnings results. Sales growth sped up to a 13% pace from the prior quarter's 12% as procedure growth hit a new high of 18%.

Image source: Getty Images.

The company's systems revenue growth might appear soft at just 4%. However, executives explained that this figure was held down due to the timing of new product launches that deferred a chunk of revenue recognition. Focusing on system sales to account for that temporary shift shows plenty of evidence of robust demand given that Intuitive Surgical shipped 133 of its core da Vinci surgical platforms in the quarter, compared to 110 systems in the prior-year period.
""We are pleased with broad-based da Vinci procedure growth during the first quarter,"" CEO Gary Guthart said in a press release. Furthermore, the company is ""encouraged by trends in key global markets and our U.S. general surgery business,"" Guthart added.
Looking forward, Intuitive Surgical aims to build on the strong procedure growth momentum it recently won. Given the sharp spike in the stock price lately, investors have to hope that the expansion pace stays robust and that Intuitive Surgical continues to book solid profit gains despite aggressive investments in research and development spending.

Motley Fool Pro is a Motley Fool subscription service featuring a real-money portfolio composed of stocks, ETFs, and options. Pro is led by advisor Jeff Fischer, who is supported by a team of Motley Fool analysts as he scours the stock market for the best risk-adjusted investment returns out there. It's a more advanced Motley Fool offering that combines several complex strategies to generate income and provide hedges for potential down markets.
Two ways Pro changes it up
Motley Fool Pro differs from more 'typical' Motley Fool subscription services like Stock Advisor in two key ways:
- Pro does not aim to beat the market. Instead, the Pro team is guided by a simple guiding principle (you'll hear Jeff refer to it as Pro's ""North Star""): Produce 7% average annual returns after inflation and positive returns over every rolling three-year period. Pro is geared toward investors who are trying to grow their capital while also hedging to prevent massive downswings. That's a tough goal to achieve, since the market...corrects from time to time (think of the 2008 crisis).
- Pro mixes philosophies and strategies. Most Motley Fool stock services have a particular bent, whether it's toward growth stocks, value stocks, small-caps, dividend stocks, options, etc. Jeff Fischer's philosophy in Pro can be simply summarized as: ""Follow the North Star."" That philosophical flexibility means that Pro can invest in all of the stock types abve, plus ETFs and options strategies of all shapes and sizes. That includes shorting, by the way  after all, betting that the market (or a stock or basket of stocks) is heading south is one of the few ways to make money if the actual market does go south.

What Motley Fool Pro doesn't change
Pro may be distinctive from most other Motley Fool services in some ways, but some underpinnings of our core philosophy remain the same:

Invest in great businesses for the long term. Here at The Motley Fool, long-term investing is at the core of everything we do. While Pro uses some short-term strategies, like options, they're used as complementary hedges, income streams, and force-multipliers in service to longer-term investing goals.

Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...
With its shares up 20% year to date, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock has handily outperformed the S&P 500's 15% return so far in 2017. But here's the really good news: Now that President Donald Trump has laid out his tax plan, one analyst thinks Cisco stock could do even better in the months and years ahead.
Here are three reasons why.

Image source: Cisco Systems.

1. Let's throw a repatriation party!
President Trump's just-released proposal for reforming the U.S. tax system includes a little something to like for everybody. For individuals, Trump's plan features a simplification of the current seven-bracket tax system to one with just three new brackets -- 10%, 25%, and 35%.
For businesses, the standard tax rate would drop from 35% to 15%. And for businesses with profits stashed abroad, hidden from the taxman until the day when they can be repatriated at a lower rate? That's the best news of all, because a lower rate is exactly what President Trump is offering -- a mere 10% repatriation tax on foreign-earned income.
That will be great news for Cisco, which at last report had well over $60 billion in foreign-earned income located offshore.
2. What comes next
As Credit Suisse explains in a new note covered by StreetInsider.com this morning, Cisco can do a lot of good with that $60 billion in cash (minus $6 billion for the tax man). The analyst predicts that, if the tax plan is passed, Cisco will repatriate much of its foreign-earned income, and engage in an ""M&A"" (merger and acquisition) spree, buying up complementary U.S. businesses. Cisco is also likely, says Credit Suisse, to shower its shareholders with ""capital returns"" in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.
And Credit Suisse isn't just speculating here. In an interview with CNBC late last year, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins confirmed that if the company is permitted to repatriate its overseas earnings at a favorable tax rate, it would then proceed upon a strategy including ""a combination of dividends [and] buybacks, as well as M&A activity.""




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-14775');
            });
        

3. What it would mean for Cisco
In Credit Suisse's view, Cisco as-is can already produce ""low-single-digit revenue growth"" through the portfolio of businesses it owns. Were Cisco able to take some of its $60 billion and spend it on buying complementary businesses, though, while simultaneously buying back shares (to reduce its share count and concentrate profits among fewer shares), Credit Suisse believes Cisco could rapidly grow its profits.
From an estimated profit of $2.38 per share this year, and $2.47 per share next year, Credit Suisse sees Cisco ultimately earning anywhere from $3.30 to $3.50 per share post-repatriation.
Altogether, that potential for a 47% increase in per-share profits over a couple of years convinces Credit Suisse that Cisco is an attractive target for investment. The analyst is so convinced, in fact, that it is doing a complete 180 reversal of opinion on Cisco, swinging its rating from underperform all the way over to outperform and assigning Cisco stock a price target of $40 per share.
The most important thing: Valuing Cisco
Is Credit Suisse right? Maybe, but knowing whether it is right about the scenario described requires one to assume that Credit Suisse is also right about President Trump's chances of getting his tax reform proposal passed by Congress intact -- and that's not a gamble I'm prepared to make.
Rather, I think investors should evaluate Cisco as it stands today. If Congress and the president later decide to provide us some upside -- great! But if not, I want to know that Cisco stock will still be cheap enough to buy as-is. So...is it?
Consider: Cisco currently sports a market capitalization of $167.3 billion. The company boasts cash reserves of $71.8 billion ($60 billion-ish of which is stashed abroad), but also debt of $34.9 billion. That leaves us with a debt-adjusted market cap, or enterprise value, of $130.4 billion.
Cisco's GAAP earnings for the past 12 months came to $9.8 billion. The company's free cash flow (FCF) for the period was $12.3 billion.
Thus, at current prices, Cisco stock sells for a debt-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio of 13.3, and an enterprise value-to-FCF ratio of just 10.6. With Cisco paying a 3.5% dividend yield and expected to generate a 5% long-term growth rate (per data from S&P Global Market Intelligence), I put the stock's total return at 8.5%, which to me, is too low to justify a 13.3 P/E or a 10.6 EV/FCF.
My conclusion? After Cisco's 20% run-up in share price this year, Cisco stock offers no margin of safety today -- unless, that is, Credit Suisse is right about the Trump tax plan being passed. If and when that happens, I'll revisit the stock's valuation. But for now, I think Cisco stock is too expensive to buy.

",Cisco Stock Upgraded: What You Need to Know
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/01/3-bargain-bin-high-yield-dividend-stocks-youve-ove.aspx,2017-05-01,"
Regardless of how well or poorly the stock market is performing, one thing is for certain: Dividend stocks are always in style.
I've often said that dividend stocks are the foundation of a great retirement portfolio -- and for good reason. For starters, companies that pay dividends usually have a long history of profitability and a sound long-term outlook. A business that doesn't have a clear path to growth typically isn't going to pay a dividend. In other words, buying dividend stocks often means buying into high-quality, profitable companies with long histories of success.

Secondly, dividend stocks can help hedge the stock market's inevitable downward swings until it turns around again. Since 1950, based on data from Yardeni Research, the S&P 500 has corrected lower by at least 10% (when rounded to the nearest digit) on 35 occasions. Owning dividend stocks is a great way to help hedge against these market swoons. As an added bonus, since dividend stocks tend to attract long-term investors, they can sometimes also be far less volatile during corrections.
Lastly, dividend stocks give you the ability to take advantage of compounding over time by reinvesting your payout back into more shares. Doing so allows your ownership in a business to grow, as well as your corresponding payout. Compounding is a tactic some of the smartest money managers use to increase the value of their funds over time.
But some of the best dividend stocks can be found floating well below investors' radars. Here are three bargain bin high-yield dividend stocks you've probably been overlooking this spring.
GlaxoSmithKline
It's been a bit of a rough decade for U.K.-based GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), but income investors may want to strongly consider this high-yield dividend stock for their portfolios.
The big issue for GlaxoSmithKline has been the loss of patent protection on Advair, its blockbuster COPD and asthma medication, and the expectation that generic entrants would soon flood the market. Interestingly enough, years after Advair lost that protection there still aren't any generic versions of the inhalable drug on the market. This has allowed Glaxo to hang onto billions in annual sales -- Advair generated $4.47 billion in sales in 2016, but was once an $8 billion a year drug -- although it's faced significant pricing pressure on its key drug. This overhang is what's put pressure on the company's share price for years.

Image source: GlaxoSmithKline.

Now for the good news: GlaxoSmithKline has a new line of respiratory products, and while their uptake hasn't been as quick as the company would like, we're seeing more in sales from new drugs than losses in revenue from mature drugs. Both Breo Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta are getting over their early insurance speed bumps, with sales of Breo and Anoro growing to $795 million and $258 million last year. Both drugs have $1 billion-plus annual sales potential, as do Glaxo's other respiratory therapies (Arnuity and Incruse).
Beyond just COPD and asthma, GlaxoSmithKline has made itself quite the footprint in HIV maintenance therapies. The company's majority holding in ViiV Healthcare, a partnership with Pfizer and Shionogi, has allowed it to benefit from the strong sales of Tivicay and Triumeq. Triumeq sales alone jumped to $2.23 billion last year, and with no cure in sight for HIV/AIDS, ViiV and Glaxo's maintenance therapies should continue to benefit.
GlaxoSmithKline is currently paying out a 4.9% dividend yield and is valued at a reasonable 15 times Wall Street's projected profits in 2017. This has all the hallmarks of a bargain-bin high-yield dividend stock worth buying this spring.
Ford Motor 
Another bargain-bin high-yield dividend stock that's fallen on a bit of hard times lately is Detroit's own Ford (NYSE:F).
There's no two ways about it: the Blue Oval has been stuck in reverse for the better part of the past year. Its market share in the U.S. has been modestly sliding, and the company's March results showed a mammoth 21% decline in units sold in China with its joint-venture partner. In March, Ford also announced a $295 million charge tied to vehicle recalls. Meanwhile, Ford shareholders have watched as Tesla, a company currently losing millions of dollars, has surpassed Ford's market cap.
Though these aren't ideal scenarios, many of Ford's issues appear temporary, making this a potentially opportune time to scoop up its stock.

2017 Ford F-150 King Ranch. Image source: Ford.

For example, the 21% decline in March sales was attributed to the Chinese government paring back tax breaks on vehicles with smaller engines. Ford notes that despite this smaller tax breaks, vehicles with larger engines saw increased sales volumes in Q1 2017 compared to the prior-year quarter.
Additionally, China remains very much in Ford's future growth plans. The company is currently constructing a plant in China to build its premium Lincoln-brand vehicles. Once completed, the plant could begin rolling vehicles off its production line by 2019. And, since the vehicles are manufactured in China, they may be able to avoid a tariff, giving the Lincoln brand an edge. Not to mention that Ford is also beginning to build electric vehicles in China to appeal to the government's focus on greener vehicles.
Within the U.S., I'd opine the angst surrounding recalls is temporary. Ford's F-Series pickup has, for 40 years now, been the best-selling truck in the U.S. , and Ford is very regularly near or at the top in most customer loyalty surveys. It also hasn't hurt that prices at the pump has been well off their highs for a few years, which has encouraged consumers to buy SUVs and trucks. Trucks and SUVs offer higher margins than sedans, so this is a long-term trade-off Ford would make any day.
Sporting a forward P/E of less than seven and a dividend yield of 5.2%, these are pedal to the metal numbers for income seekers.

            });
        

L Brands
If you want yet another bargain-bin high-yielding stock to consider buying this spring, L Brands (NYSE:LB), the company behind Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, is worth a look.
Though it probably needn't be said, the consumer is a fickle creature and retailers do, from time to time, deal with hiccups. L Brands has mostly avoided these hiccups due to the unbelievable strength of the Victoria's Secret brand. Recently, this strength has turned into weakness. Recently reported March same-store comparisons saw Victoria's Secret sales fall 13% year-over-year. Some of the blame can be placed on the negative impact of Easter shifting into April, but the exit of swim apparel at Victoria's Secret has been a big hindrance.

Image source: L Brands.

Like Glaxo and Ford, the recent news hasn't been great, but there aren't any real long-term concerns. Same-store comps will clean up nicely once swim apparel is removed from the year-over-year comparisons, and consumers should remain as addicted as ever to brand-name merchandise.
Furthermore, L Brands has been focused on expanding its reach in China. The company has opened two stores in the considerably faster-growing country, but that amounts to 0.2% of total Victoria's Secret stores open as of March. It's going to time for these extra expenses and investments to pay off for L Brands, but it should boost the company's longer-term growth rate.
L Brands is also rethinking its approach of marketing to the consumer. Part of its ongoing restructuring includes fewer promotional mailers. While this has probably had something to do with the weaker sales at its flagship Victoria's Secret line, over the long run it'll place more emphasis and value on its core brands, probably increasing consumers' desire to own them.
Valued at 15 times Wall Street's projected 2017 EPS and paying out a healthy 4.8% yield, L Brands is a reasonably priced stock that could be nabbed off the sale rack by income seekers.

",3 Bargain-Bin High-Yield Dividend Stocks You've Overlooked This Spring
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/26/can-royal-gold-inc-weather-a-market-downturn.aspx,2017-04-26,"
Royal Gold, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGLD) operates in the precious-metals industry, but it isn't your typical gold and silver miner. Royal Gold is a streaming and royalty company, which changes the equation quite a bit. For example, if there's a broad market downturn, gold prices are likely to go up because of gold's role as an alternative asset and store of wealth. But what if commodities hit the skids again? Well, that's an opportunity, too. Here's why.
What is streaming?
Royal Gold is one of the larger precious-metals streaming companies. That means it gives money up front to miners in return for the right to buy gold and silver, among other things, in the future at reduced rates. For example, Royal Gold has a deal with Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX) in which it pays 30% of the spot price for gold and silver from the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic up to certain production levels, and then 60% of the spot price thereafter.

You can see why Royal Gold would want to lock in low prices, but why would Barrick Gold ink that agreement? At the time of the deal, in 2015, miners like Barrick were under financial strain and looking for cash to solidify their balance sheets. The upfront payment of $610 million was a big help to Barrick's balance sheet. But there are other reasons for setting up streaming agreements, too, such as monetizing byproducts that aren't a main corporate focus (think of a copper-focused miner that also pulls up precious metals) or to help fund development projects when other financing options are less desirable. It really is a mutually beneficial arrangement.
What happens to Royal Gold if the market goes down?
So while Royal Gold doesn't mine for precious metals, it is a precious-metals company. And that means its top and bottom lines are largely determined by the price of silver and gold, though it does have exposure to some other commodities, mostly copper. Both gold and silver are considered stores of wealth.

RGLD data by YCharts
In a market downturn, investors often turn to silver and gold as safe havens, boosting their prices. But not all investors want to own gold directly, instead opting for precious-metals stocks -- which helps explain why Royal Gold kept moving higher between 2007 and 2009, when the S&P 500 Index was falling. In case you don't remember, that was a time period that included the last recession in addition to the major market downturn.
If there's a market correction, I'd expect Royal Gold to hold up pretty well. But what about a reversal in the price of gold and silver?




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-99552');
            });
        

What happens to Royal Gold if precious metals go down?
Now here's the interesting thing about Royal Gold's streaming business model. When Barrick was struggling, Royal Gold came in and provided it with cash. In fact, deals like this one made during the commodity downturn allowed Royal Gold to increase its volume by 13% in fiscal 2015 and a massive 36% in fiscal 2016. In other words, a precious-metals downturn is an opportunity for Royal Gold to grow its business.   
To be fair, if gold and silver prices fall, Royal Gold's top and bottom lines will fall, too. So a commodity downturn would probably lead investors to sell the stock. But that would probably be a mistake, since the company has proved it can strengthen its business when miners are struggling. 

Royal Gold's dividend moved up despite falling gold prices. Image source: Royal Gold, Inc

And there's a good reason to stick around -- dividends. Royal Gold has increased its dividend for 16 consecutive years, even though gold prices are still much lower today than they were in 2012. That income stream can help you tough it out while Royal Gold looks for the next big deal in a precious-metals downturn -- which will make it a better company when the next upturn comes around.  
A double play
So because of its precious-metals focus, Royal Gold will probably hold up, if not go up, during the next market downturn. But it will also have the opportunity to create value for shareholders during the next commodity downturn, by inking streaming deals at an advantageous time. Add in the dividend yield of around 1.3%, backed by a steadily growing disbursement, and there's a lot to like here -- even if Royal Gold is faced with a broad market or precious metals-specific downturn. 

","Can Royal Gold, Inc. Weather a Market Downturn?"
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/23/3-beaten-up-virtual-reality-stocks-are-they-bargai.aspx,2017-04-23,"
The market size for virtual reality is expected to reach $33.9 billion by 2022, and hit nearly 100 million headsets shipped worldwide by 2021 for both augmented-reality and virtual-reality (VR) devices. But not everyone is benefiting from all of that potential just yet. 
GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) are three companies that have all made plays in the VR space, but their share prices aren't booming along with other VR players like NVIDIA, AMD, and others. So let's take a look at what these companies are doing to expand their virtual-reality offerings, and whether or not they look like bargains in the space. 

Image source: Intel.

GoPro 
There was a lot of chatter last year surrounding GoPro's move into the virtual-reality market with its Omni rig. The cube-shaped device holds six HERO cameras to capture video from nearly every angle, and is used in combination with the company's Kolor software -- a VR software company GoPro purchased -- to stitch the video together for VR and 360-degree viewing.

Image source: GoPro.

I was skeptical that GoPro's rig would have much of a splash in the broader VR market, mainly because of its high cost. The rig itself is $1,500 and the full system (with six cameras) totals $5,000. That's clearly too high for most consumers, and only appeals to those who want to create VR content, not those who want to consume it. 
Rigs aside, GoPro doesn't appear to be doing much else in the VR space at the moment, perhaps because it's busy trying to put out the fires from its botched release of its Karma drone and dealing with its less-than-stellar earnings reports. The Karma drone, along with some production problems with its HERO5 camera, have caused the company's share price to tumble. Take a look:

Source: YCharts.
Considering that GoPro's only foray into virtual reality involves a rig that holds six cameras and some software that most people have never heard of, I think betting on GoPro as a VR investment is a bad idea. Additionally, until the company can get back on its feet with camera production and prove that it can find new revenue streams, the stock has a lot to prove before investors should give it a look.
Intel
Intel is constantly looking to new markets to spur sales of its chips as PC sales continue to slow. One such opportunity is in selling faster -- and more expensive -- processors into PCs, which can handle the requirements of high-end VR headsets.
Fellow Fool Ashraf Eassa pointed out recently that Intel mentioned at its recent investor meeting that it's hoping that the growth of VR headsets will be a catalyst for future chip sales. Intel appears to be already focusing on this for some of its chips, and on its website, it describes its Core i7 chip as having a ""great VR experience"" and has ""the power to deliver amazing game physics, rich 360 degree 3D visuals, precise controls, and immersive 3D sound."" 
The company also has its own VR headset, called Project Alloy, which comes with an Intel chip embedded inside the device. That's a huge differentiating feature from other high-end headsets, which have to be tethered to a computer. The device is only offered as a developer kit right now, but it shows that Intel is thinking of new ways to convince device makers that its chips should be at the forefront of the VR market. 

Source: YCHARTS.
Intel isn't exactly the most obvious beaten-up stock, considering that it's gained more than 13% over the past year. But compared to the nearly 12% gains the S&P 500 has made over the past 12 months, there's certainly room for improvement.
It's still very early in Intel's VR push, but the company is making some smart moves in the space that could eventually help boost its chip sales. Considering Intel's massive reach in the semiconductor space, its low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 17, and its ongoing push into new markets like VR, I think the company looks like a bargain compared to the other players right now.

            });
        

Ambarella
Another chipmaker that's moving further into the VR space is Ambarella. The company is best known for supplying chips for GoPro's action cameras, but earlier this year, it released its new H3 system-on-a-chip (SoC), which it believes is an ideal chip for virtual-reality cameras. The SoC is capable of delivering 8K Ultra HD at 30 frames per second and 4K Ultra HD at 120 frames per second.
Ambarella says that it's expecting increasing, but slow, growth from the VR market. The company's CEO, Fermi Wang, said on the fiscal Q4 2017 earnings call in February:

We are still watching the virtual reality market. We have announced several customers previously and we continue to see design win activity, and in terms of the market development, I think it's still at a very early stage and it's still hard for us to tell how big the market is, so while we continue supporting our key customers for this market, we are still conservative on the revenue outlook for this. 

Over the past year, Ambarella's stock has been on a wild ride, and recent price changes have been moving in the wrong direction. Ambarella's stock-price gains over the past 12 months have just barely beaten the S&P 500. But compared to other VR processor plays, like AMD (up 376%) and NVIDIA (up 172%), it's also not that impressive.

Source: YCharts.
Ambarella certainly has some prospects in the VR market, but I'm still concerned with the company's strong reliance on selling chips to GoPro. The chipmaker is diversifying its sales so that it can wean itself off its GoPro dependence, but that hasn't fully happened yet, and its virtual reality chip won't do much to accelerate it. For those reasons, I don't think Ambarella is a bargain VR stock right now. 
Investors looking to get started in VR certainly have their pick of stocks. Tech companies both small and large are betting on this burgeoning market, and investors needing a primer on how to get started should consider following this quick five-point checklist for investing in VR.

",3 Beaten-Up Virtual Reality Stocks: Are They Bargains?
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/29/what-investors-missed-in-the-market-this-week.aspx,2017-04-29,"
Another trading week is in the books, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average trading 1.5% and 1.9% higher, respectively. Despite the market rally, it wasn't a great week in terms of economic data, as GDP was reported to have increased a meager 0.7% during the first quarter, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, according to the Commerce Department -- the weakest quarterly mark since early 2014. Take the report with a grain of salt, as these are always adjusted at later dates. 
With that aside, let's look at some companies boasting big moves, big earnings, or big headlines this week in the markets.
Steel stock meltdown
It wasn't a pretty week for shares of steel manufacturer United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), which shed roughly a quarter of its market capitalization as its stock price imploded. Just a few months ago, the stock was on fire, in a good way, and nearly doubled from the moment Donald Trump was elected president through the middle of March. The movement higher was largely based on the hope that Trump's potential infrastructure plan would increase demand for U.S. steel.

Image source: Getty Images.

Since then it's been a consistent downhill trend, culminating in this week's implosion after the company's earnings disappointed its once hopeful investors. In terms of the financial results, revenue was up 16% during the first quarter to $2.7 billion, but despite a recent rise in metal prices, the company still posted a net loss of $180 million, or $1.03 per share. 
But perhaps the real issue for investors was that it is now painfully obvious U.S. Steel is behind some of its competitors with improving its operations and cutting costs. To that point, management noted that it's upgrading its equipment and other processes that will take three to four years -- causing some investors to throw in the towel or opt for a different steel company. 
Even Macquarie's once bullish analyst, Aldo Mazzaferro, had this to say, according to Barron's: ""We reduce our rating to ""underperform"" from ""neutral,"" and cut our target price to $18 from $30, after further assessing the damage to earnings from the planned [three- to four-year], over $1 billion asset-revitalization program to upgrade mills. Even after the sharp decline in the shares, we see further downside to $18."" 
Not if, but when
It seems management of the once popular and even profitable Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD) is just squeezing out as much time as possible before this slow-motion train wreck finally ends. In what's become a common theme over the past year, shares of the troubled retailer plunged by double digits multiple times this week and shed almost a quarter of its value.
It all started last Friday, when Sears announced that its comparable-store sales have dropped nearly 12% since the beginning of the year. It followed that news up with another bombshell: Despite its cost cuts, its first-quarter adjusted EBITDA would check in with a $190 million loss at best, and it could be as bad as a $230 million loss. That's little to no improvement from last year's equally brutal $181 million loss during the first quarter. Keep Sears' adjusted EBITDA in mind when hearing that Sears ends up posting a positive net income during the first quarter, because that's solely due to the sale of its Craftsman business and other real estate transactions -- factors that are obviously unsustainable. 
Sears' increasingly inevitable bankruptcy isn't for lack of effort by its management team that has faced a nearly impossible task to turn around an outdated business model in many crumbling mall locations with outdated stores. Despite the tall task, though, management isn't sitting idle and announced on Monday that Sears would close 50 Auto Centers and 92 Kmart pharmacies -- this is in addition to the earlier announcement of 150 store closings.
Businesses com and go, and what once was a booming retailer is now facing its inevitable demise. It seems not a matter of whether it happens, but when.

A step in the right direction
Let's end this weekly recap on a bright note from an often forgotten automaker that's also faced its fair share of doom and gloom: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU). There are plenty of things FCA needs to work on, but one thing it does well is sell popular Jeep SUVs and full-size Ram Trucks. 

Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

Thanks in large part to those two brands, the company's net revenue checked in 4% higher during the first quarter, with its adjusted EBIT up a more impressive 11% to $1.67 billion. Those results were enough to top analysts' estimates and set a first-quarter record for Detroit's third largest automaker. Perhaps even more impressive is that it sent the company's stock up roughly 11% on Wednesday, after investors digested the information -- impressive because the stock had already rallied significantly since Donald Trump won the election.
Outside its very profitable and high-volume-selling Jeep and full-size truck products, there was another impressive development: FCA's high-end luxury Maserati brand has started gaining some serious traction on the bottom line. For context, during last year's first quarter, Maserati generated a modest 1.1% of FCA's total adjusted EBIT. This year, thanks to an 89% increase in shipments and an 820-basis-point improvement in margin, its adjusted EBIT soared 569%, from 16 million euros to 107 million euros.
FCA, which is often an afterthought with Detroit automakers, posted a strong enough quarter to warrant its recent rally and give investors hope that its Maserati brand can also help fuel a companywide turnaround.

",What Investors Missed in the Market This Week

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell short of its first-quarter subscriber targets, but it's off to a good start for the second quarter. CEO Reed Hastings announced on Friday afternoon that Netflix had hit 100 million members. 
Hastings chose an unusual way to reveal that his company's user base had cracked nine figures. He posted a photo of himself, enjoying a steak dinner at Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN) on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Hastings has a history of celebrating milestones this way.

There's a Grand Slam on the menu
Hastings put out the celebratory post after the market closed on Friday, so investors will have to wait until Monday to gauge the market's reaction. It's still encouraging, even if it's odd to see the man behind the biggest S&P 500 gainer through the past four years eating alone at Denny's. The photo's caption suggests that it's the way he celebrated cracking a million members several years earlier:

Celebrating 100m members the same way I did 1m: a steak alone at Denny's. #superstitious

The milestone is a pretty big deal, especially since earlier in the week Netflix revealed that it closed out the first quarter with 98.75 million streaming accounts. Its earlier guidance was calling for 99 million, making this a rare miss for Netflix. 
Netflix on Monday initiated a forecast of 3.2 million net additions for the second quarter. It was 1.25 million net additions away from 100 million, and with the fifth season of House of Cards not rolling until May 30, it was easy to assume the company would crack that ceiling at some point in May.

""Netflix's subscriber tally should cross into nine figures by early May, and you can be sure that bears will let the market know if it's mid-May and Netflix hasn't issued a press release,"" I wrote on Tuesday. We didn't have to wait long for this welcome surprise.
Nabbing 1.25 million net additions in the first three weeks of the quarter is huge. Having another cult fave original on its hands -- 13 Reasons Why -- is helping, but with House of Cards on tap for next month, it's easy to wonder if Netflix is once again being conservative in its forecast for 3.2 million additions. It landed more than a million more net additions than it was forecasting in the third and fourth quarters of last year. 
Hastings has more than earned that steak dinner at Denny's. As a member of Facebook's board of directors, he's chosen the social-networking giant before as his way to break news of a major milestone. It probably won't be the last time we see him posting on Facebook from Denny's, though the path to 200 million or even 150 million will take a long time.  
",The Steaks Are High: Netflix Hits 100 Million
http://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/03/24/ask-a-fool-what-are-some-stocks-that-could-protect.aspx,2017-03-24,"
Q: With the stock market at record highs, I'm worried that we could be overdue for a crash. What are some stocks that could help protect my portfolio?
There are several types of stocks that tend to outperform the market during crashes and corrections. One big category is long-established dividend-growth stocks, particularly those that have raised their dividend every year for a long time period. Companies like AT&T, Procter & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson immediately come to mind. These stocks have increased their dividends by 32, 60, and 54 consecutive years, respectively, and all three handily beat the S&P 500 in 2008, the last time the market crashed.
In addition, consider companies that sell non-discretionary items at the cheapest prices. Dollar stores, such as Dollar Tree, are an excellent example of this, as they sell products that people need (as opposed to things they want) at lower prices than their competitors. Many businesses like this actually do better in tough economies, as they benefit from consumers who become more value-conscious. In fact, while the S&P 500 lost nearly 38% in 2008, Dollar Tree actually gained 65% for the year.
As many successful investors know, it's more important to outperform during the tough times than it is to capture the market's performance in years when everything is going up. And while there's no way to accurately predict when the next market correction or crash will come, stocks like these can help you get through it in good shape.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/29/demystifying-alternative-asset-managers.aspx,2017-04-29,"

Alternative asset management firms like Oaktree (NYSE:OAK), KKR, and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are complicated businesses, and individual investors tend to shun their stocks because of it.
In this week's episode of Industry Focus: Financials, host Gaby Lapera is joined by Jordan Wathen to dive into alternative asset management, and what factors individual investors should look at before deciding to buy into one. Find out why these firms' business models are so complicated; what kinds of investors tend to use them to manage their funds; what the best of these firms do differently from the rest; how they are similar to hedge funds -- and how they differ; what their fee structures look like; what investors should watch out for; and more.



A full transcript follows the video.







This video was recorded on April 24, 2017.

Gaby Lapera: Hello, everyone! Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. You're listening to the Financials edition, taped on Monday, April 24, 2017. My name is Gaby Lapera, and joining me on Skype is Jordan Wathen, an exotic financials expert. Hey, Jordan! How's it going?
Jordan Wathen: Hi, Gaby! I like the intro: an exotic financials expert.
Lapera: I just realized that sounds way more risque than what I actually meant, which is that you know a lot about weird financial businesses, like businesses that have strange structures, and esoteric ways of making money, which is what today's show is about, which is why I introduced you as an exotic financials expert. [laughs]
Anyway, today, we're going to be talking about alternative asset managers. If you're already lost, that's totally OK. We're going to do our best to explain everything, or at least something. Today's question is actually based on some feedback that we got from a listener at the University of Chicago. I forgot to ask his permission to use his name, so we won't, but thank you so much for the great questions. Good luck with your junior year. That's always a long, hard slog.
This is what the listener had to say: ""I wanted to hear your thoughts on investing in alternative asset management firms, i.e. Oaktree, KKR, Blackstone. Many have claimed that these firms are trading at a discount for a number of reasons. Their business models and financial statements are egregiously difficult understand, frustrating many retail and institutional investors. There's a drastic variability in yearly results. And profitability is highly dependent on assets under management."" My answer to you is yes, yes, yes, and yes. We'll backtrack first. Alternative asset managers are confusing, so let's start at the beginning. What is an alternative asset manager? Jordan, to you.
Wathen: To put it very simply, an alternative asset manager is an asset manager that manages alternative assets. I guess the more important thing is, what is an alternative asset? The best description is that an alternative asset is something that the average Joe isn't likely to own as part of their portfolio. Think things like private equity or venture capital or distressed debt, for example.
Lapera: It also includes stuff like real estate, if it's not just your house, or certain collectible stuff like artwork, but that tends to be very exotic.
Wathen: Right, I shouldn't forget about artwork. I guess, when you think about alternative assets, there's really two things that sets them apart. The first thing is that they're illiquid: They take time to buy and sell. The strategies that these managers use take time to generate returns. For example, Blackstone might by a private company for one of its funds and then hold that company for seven or 10 years before it sells that company and distributes the profits to its investors. A distressed debt fund might buy debt with the goal of taking control of a company in bankruptcy, which is a long slog, a nasty process, and it takes time to generate returns that way, too. So, these funds typically have a lock-up period in which investors can't access their money for five or even 10 years. And actually, there's been some effort by the Blackstones of the world to extend this lock up period for as long as 15 or 20 years. 
Lapera: That's a long time, especially for your average investor, which kind of brings me to my next point, which is that generally, it's not your average investor who's giving money to these alternative asset managers. It's super-wealthy individuals or families, pension funds, and, am I forgetting someone? I feel like I am.
Wathen: Pension funds, state governments, colleges. The Ivy League schools have $250 billion combined between all of them; they're major investors in this kind of world. The big commonality with all these investors is they're generally tax-free. The managers who manage this money can invest differently because their investors don't care about whether or not the returns are long-term capital gains or short-term capital gains. It really doesn't matter because they're not paying taxes anyway.
Lapera: Yeah. The next question would be, how do they make money? As we've answered, it depends on the asset manager, because they might specialize in different things. For example, Blackstone specializes in private equity, but it also does some real estate and hedge-fund solutions.
Wathen: Right. Blackstone is really known for private equity, but their hedge-fund solutions business has grown really big. To define that, it's basically a fund of funds. Someone comes to Blackstone with $1 billion and they say, ""We want to invest in the world's best hedge funds, help us find them,"" and then they take a small cut for doing that. So there's really a bunch of different ways that they can make money.
And, as we talked about, the big difference with alternative asset managers is the fee structures are different. If we look at the world of mutual funds, a company like T. Rowe Price, which manages billions upon billions of dollars, it manages them in traditional mutual funds, things that you and I might own, not private equity funds or whatever. It earns a simple 1% or 0.8% management fee on the assets it manages, and that's it. Alternative asset managers, on the other hand, their funds are structured so they get a management fee, plus incentive fees when they generate returns in excess of a hurdle rate. The investor might want 8% a year, and beyond that, the fund company, if they generate 10% per year, they'll get 20% of that upside, of the 2% over 8%.
Lapera: Exactly. Listeners, what you might be hearing is, these asset managers make money in two different ways. One is through the fees, which sometimes are dependent on assets under management and a bunch of other things. The other thing that they might make money on is their actual investments. Hopefully, they're investing in such a way that they're actually creating profit. But when you talk about investing in an asset management firm, like I said, you're probably not talking about actually giving your money to the asset management firm; you're talking about buying stock in the asset management firm.
Wathen: Generally, these companies, say, Oaktree Capital Group, for example, they manage something like $100 billion of assets. They also have about $1.5 billion that's invested in their funds. But for the most part, the big earnings driver is the fees they generate on the $100 billion, rather than the $1.5 billion of their own capital that they manage.
Lapera: Yeah, definitely. I think the next question that we want to ask -- to go back to the original question that was asked by the listener -- as you guys have seen, these firms can be very difficult to understand, because they're investing in a type of asset that is not really all that commonplace, so you have to understand a little bit about the assets in order to even decode their balance sheet or income statement. The second part of that question is, there can be drastic variability in yearly results, and that the profitability is highly dependent on assets under management. When you're looking at investing in one of these firms, what are some of the things that you should look for? I think the best way to do this is pick one, since they're all so different from each other, and dig in. We talked about doing Oaktree.
Wathen: Yeah. The important thing that you have to remember when you invest in the asset management company is that it's really only as good as its funds are. An asset manager that runs a bad fund won't be in business very long, especially not charging 1.5% on assets, plus 20% incentive fees. The world doesn't want to invest in an underperforming fund that charges an above-average fee. So, one way to get a really good idea of how a business like Oaktree is performing is to look at the balance sheet. Look at net accrued incentives. This reflects how much Oaktree will receive in incentive income from its funds -- basically, fees that it earns for generating good performance minus any bonus compensation that it owes its employees as a result of those returns. What you'd really like to see is this net incentive income, or this accrued incentive income, increases over the course of time.
Lapera: Is there ever [a case of] ""This has increased too much?""
Wathen: No, there's no such thing as that number increasing too much. If anything, that would mark something like a cyclical peak. So, if, let's say tomorrow, the debt markets fall out, Oaktree is going to raise tens of billions of dollars and put it to work almost immediately, and within the next couple years, as the economy recovers, you would see that incentive income come up. Then, over time, as those funds are liquidated, they would pay off their investors, and the money would come back to them for generating those superior returns. If anything, you have ebbs and flows in it, but no, there's no such thing as too much.
Lapera: That's actually a really good point that you just made. It's a very cyclical business, much like the financial markets at large. But the interesting thing about alternative asset managers is that they often tend to do well when the market is doing poorly, because they act as hedge funds.
Wathen: Right. Oaktree has a reputation for being the company that doesn't want to attract assets just to attract assets. If Oaktree gives you a call and says, ""We're raising a new distressed debt fund,"" it's because they see opportunities, or they see a world in which they will have opportunities in the next few years. Because of that, they're one of the few asset managers that even runs $100 billion or more. But, they're part of that select group that can really make a phone call and raise $10 billion overnight. I mean that almost literally, because they earned that credibility with investors, and because their returns have been so good over time.
Lapera: Yeah. I think the other thing to look at when you are investing in alternative asset managers is who the management is, because that can make a huge difference. In Oaktree, it's definitely noticeable.
Wathen: Right. They have this company culture that the investor comes first, and the shareholders will be taken care of before that. Actually, if you look at Oaktree's balance sheet, you'll see it has about $6 a share in net accrued incentives that it's earned from these funds, because it calls money when it actually sees good opportunities, not just because it wants to raise a fund and charge more management fees. It's just not that kind of business.
Lapera: Yeah. And for that, you really have to trust that the management knows what it's doing. If you don't trust the management of an alternative asset manager, don't invest in them. It doesn't matter how lucrative it looks, just don't do it, because you fundamentally disagree with how it's being run.
Wathen: I completely agree with that.
Lapera: We talked a little bit about what alternative asset managers are, how they make money, different revenue streams, things that should look good on their income sheet, income statement, balance sheet, 10-K, 10-Q, financial statements in general. Is there anything you would look at and be like, ""This is a huge red flag for an asset manager""?
Wathen: I think this extends across any business, financial or otherwise: Truly great businesses have pricing power. That means they can raise prices, or at least control prices, to some extent. For example, if Warren Buffett tomorrow stepped down from Berkshire Hathaway and said, ""I'm going to raise a $5 billion stock fund and become a hedge fund manager again,"" he would have no problem finding investors at 2% and 20%, the typical fee structure. I bet he would even have a line out the door at 3% and 30%. There's actually a company by the name of Renaissance Technologies, it runs something called The Medallion Fund. It's the most legendary hedge fund of all time: It charges 5% on assets, plus 44% of returns. The fees are ridiculous, but the returns are so good, no one cares. If you earn 20% after fees, you don't care what the fees are, it just doesn't matter. So, while investment fees are generally coming down, good asset managers should be able to hold the line, or at least slow the ...
Lapera: The free fall?
Wathen: ... the trend toward lower fees.
Lapera: Yeah. And part of the reason for that trend toward lower fees is actually in an alternative asset management adjacent field, which is the ETFs and the mutual funds and the index funds. You're seeing fees go down really fast in those areas because of the automatically generated nature of these. Companies like Vanguard are pushing for lower fees, because it doesn't make sense in a lot of cases for an S&P 500 ETF, for example, to have a 1% management fee. That doesn't make sense. You're just taking all the companies that are in the S&P 500 -- you're not guessing or anything -- and putting them into an index fund. So, I think you're seeing this widespread fee lowering. The other thing is the power of information. Now that consumers have the internet, they can just go and see what the fees are on other funds, and be like, ""You know, I'm not going to pay 1% when I could pay 0.05% for this other fund.""
Wathen: It's the exact same thing that's going on in traditional asset managers. If a mutual fund manager could promise me they were going to beat the S&P 500 by 2% a year, I'd happily pay 1.75% a year in expenses and take the 0.25% extra return. No one is going to complain about that. But if the returns aren't there and you're charging a higher fee, you won't be in business very long. And ETFs, and all these passive funds, for that matter, are really just taking more and more share for that reason.
Lapera: Yeah, which is why I, as we circle back to alternative asset managers, they are able to charge higher fees -- because in theory, they're making more than the return on the S&P 500.
Wathen: Right, they're generating superior returns, and they're also working harder for it. Oaktree, when it takes a distressed debt fund and starts raising money for it and then starts investing in it, they're going to have to go through bankruptcy courts, all this stuff, to take control of these companies. It's a long slog. It takes money and capital and geniuses to figure out these opportunities. So, that's what you're paying for, in theory.
Lapera: Yeah. OK. I think, we set out to cover a bunch of things, and I think we've covered them. Listeners, if I'm wrong, go ahead and write me an email at industryfocus@fool.com, and I'm happy to talk about this again. This is probably a topic that can span multiple episodes, but I promise to give you guys a break in between them. So, for people who don't like alternative asset managers -- I don't even know if you're still listening. If you're not, know you have a choice not to listen to the podcast if it's about something boring. I had someone write to me the other day, and they were like, ""Why do you cover such boring things sometimes?"" I'm like, ""Why do you listen to the podcast if you think it's boring? Just skip that episode, go to the next one!"" [laughs]
Wathen: Right. It's hard to make financial stocks truly something that looks great. People aren't drawn to them by nature.
Lapera: Yeah. I mean, I think we're fascinating. [laughs] 
Wathen: Of course! I'm not biased or anything, but I would say so too.
Lapera: OK, so, question for you, Jordan. Would you invest in an alternative asset manager? Would you buy stock?
Wathen: Yes. But that comes with a very big caveat that I wouldn't invest in most of them. One of the problems with financial companies in general -- and this extends from banking to asset management to alternative asset management -- is that so many of them are actually run to maximize compensation for employees, rather than profits for shareholders. The shareholders are at the bottom, taking what's left over after everyone has taken their $2 million bonus. As an exception to that rule, the one that I'm most interested in, and I'm glad we talked about it today, was Oaktree. I generally like it as a business model. It's one of the few financial companies that gets better as the world gets worse, which is a nice diversification thing. Earlier this year, I put together a model for it, and I updated it prior to the show, valuing it in two pieces: the assets it owns and the business as it stands. I value it at about $53 per share, and I think that's kind of conservative. And it's a stock that, if it traded a little bit lower -- I had to make a lot of assumptions to get to that valuation -- but if it traded a little bit lower, I would be interested in it.
Lapera: Yeah. I actually also really like Oaktree, especially because the investor letters that they share are always really interesting; a lot of really interesting investment knowledge in there. I encourage listeners to go ahead and read those, they're a pretty valuable resource. As for me, if I would invest in alternative asset managers -- they're currently not for me right now, mostly because I have no money, so I can't actually invest in anything right now, not until I have a little bit more money. But even if I did have money, I think I'm more interested in other types of stocks right now. But I wouldn't rule it out as a future investment.
Wathen: I think timing is important, too. A company like Blackstone, which makes a lot of money from private equity, its business gets better as the world gets better and the economy improves. This late in an economic cycle, I don't know if you want to hold a cyclical company like that, if you want to be the buyer right now this late. With Oaktree, it's the opposite. They get better as distressed debt opportunities come up. So, that would be a company that would get better as things get worse, so it's maybe more attractive this late in the cycle than something like a private-equity company, for example.
Lapera: Yeah. And I know we're going to get an email now saying, ""I thought The Fool said not to time the market."" That's true. You shouldn't time the market. But it's one thing to be like, ""I'm going to time the market and do all this technical analysis,"" and it's another thing to be like, ""I think this cycle is about probably about here, and reasonably I can assume that this is what the business will do if it goes this way or that."" And if you're wrong, you can always just buy, if you really believe in the company. Just buy it. Dollar-cost average it.
Wathen: It's not even really so much timing the market. It's like, if I own Bank of America, I know that when the economy gets worse, when unemployment goes up and GDP drops for a few quarters or a year, their loan performance is going to be bad. It's just going to. They'll have more defaults and more loan losses. Oaktree, for example: It's a company where it's going to make more money as things get worse. That's where it really shines. So it's diversification, if anything. Instead of buying, maybe, banks, I want to own a little bit more of this alternative asset manager.
Lapera: Yeah. So, think about it for you. Think about which one you want to do. Do a lot of research to figure out what the company actually invests in, and if it's a good idea, and what part of the cycle that benefits from, and what the fee structures look like -- basically everything we talked about in this episode, I'm not going to say it all over again because we're running out of time.
As usual, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Thank you very much for joining us, Jordan!
Wathen: It was fun, Gaby. I always enjoy it!
Lapera: I know. And I always really like it when we do these weird ones, because I know that's right up your weird alley.
Wathen: I get sucked in by complexity. It's a disease, really, but it makes it more fun.
Lapera: I think it's wonderful. Anyway, contact us at industryfocus@fool.com, or by tweeting us @MFIndustryFocus and let us know what you'd like to hear about next.

As Q1 earnings season really starts to get underway, investors are waiting to see how reporting companies can shed light on the state of the economy. Healthcare was the biggest losing sector today, largely dragged down by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), though financials and energy took a hit as well.

J&J loses some steam
Healthcare megaconglomerate Johnson & Johnson saw its shares fall around 3% after the company reported first-quarter earnings that were below analyst expectations.
Investors' disappointment appears to mostly stem from lower-than-expected pharmaceutical sales, as the company's U.S. sales declined about 1.3% over the same quarter last year. Analysts seem to be fearing what those results could signal for the broader market, helping to push shares down for other similar healthcare companies, both large and small.

Facebook showcases its future
The tech industry was buzzing today as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) held its F8 developers conference, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that augmented reality (AR) -- computer-generated additions to real-world surroundings as seen through a camera (think Pokemon Go) -- would play a large role in Facebook's future. Management noted that the technology is still in its very early stages, and while the current features like adding art to buildings and changing lighting in real-time video are impressive, one might imagine using it in new ways, like rendering 3D mockups of products in your home, or displaying relevant information on top of an item or location.

AR has helped rival Snap Inc.'s (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat grow quickly in popularity with fun effects and masks that users can add to selfie videos. Facebook has implemented many features already in its Facebook and Instagram platforms that are in direct competition to Snap, such as Stories, which allows users to post small videos to a daily feed. This push for more AR features seems to be another effort to keep the heat on the smaller social media company. Zuckerberg also hinted at eventual physical eyeglasses utilizing AR technology, which would be another direct jab at Snap, which launched its own physical glasses last year. 
The company announced a few other interesting updates such as Facebook Spaces, a virtual world for the company's Oculus Rift virtual reality headset that would put multiple users together in a virtual setting, no matter where they are physically in the world.
Facebook shares declined less than 1% today. The company reports its first-quarter earnings on May 3.

The S&P 500 and NASDAQ have both stayed almost flat in April, as political uncertainties capped any significant gains. While that flat growth is certainly disappointing, several stocks fared much worse over the past month. Let's examine three tech stocks that posted steep declines in April, and whether or not they can bounce back in May.

NantHealth
Shares of healthcare tech company NantHealth (NASDAQ:NH) have fallen around 38% in April due to growing doubts about the company's core GPS (Genomic Proteomic Spectrometry) Cancer product. The GPS Cancer test analyzes tumor genetics and recommends possible courses of treatment, and is supported by NantOS, a cloud-based platform for healthcare providers, payors, self-insured employers, and pharmaceutical companies. 
When NantHealth reported its fourth quarter earnings at the end of March, it became clear that physicians weren't eagerly adopting the GPS Cancer test. It sold a mere 452 tests during the quarter, compared to 524 orders in the previous quarter. Reportedly over 300 of those tests were bought for research purposes instead of diagnosing actual patients. NantHealth generated $100 million in revenue from selling those tests last year, but it reported a steep loss of $184 million -- more than double its loss in 2015.
CEO Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong tried to allay investor concerns by claiming that ""adoption is now beginning to take hold,"" but the company also warned that it will ""incur operating losses over the near term"" as it tries to expand the GPS Cancer test's market. Unfortunately, investors don't seem willing to wait around to see if physicians warm up to the test.
Unisys
IT services, virtualization, and outsourcing company Unisys (NYSE:UIS) has shed 14% of its value in April (although at one point it was as much as 21%), after a fourth quarter earnings miss and a $440 million offering of senior secured notes raised questions about its long-term growth. Analysts expect Unisys' revenue to fall 4% to $2.7 billion this year, compared to a 6% decline in 2015. Its earnings are expected to remain negative for the next two years.
Unisys has been hurt by the same headwinds that have weighed down the entire IT industry over the past few years -- sluggish enterprise spending and the rise of nimbler cloud-based rivals. To make matters worse, Unisys relies heavily on H1-B visas, which allow foreign IT professionals to work in the U.S. Critics of H1-B visas -- which notably include the Trump Administration -- claim that tech companies use H1-B visas to avoid hiring American workers with higher salaries.
These long-term pressures make it tough to love Unisys. However, the company trades at just 0.2 times sales, which makes it much cheaper than comparable IT services players like Accenture and Wipro, which respectively trade at 2.2 and 2.1 times sales.

Finisar
Shares of fiber optic components maker Finisar (NASDAQ:FNSR) fell 17% in April due to a big third-quarter miss in mid-March. Its revenue rose 23% annually to $380.6 million, but that missed expectations by $9 million. Earnings rose 136% to $0.59 per share, but that also missed estimates by three cents. Finisar's top and bottom line guidance for the fourth quarter (16% sales growth and 83% earnings growth at the midpoints) also came in below Wall Street estimates.
Finisar's growth figures might seem robust, but analysts expected better numbers due to the so-called ""super cycle"" across the fiber optic industry. That cycle is fueled by service providers and companies upgrading their aging infrastructure to handle the increased use of streaming media, cloud-based apps, and virtualization solutions.
Despite Finisar's pullback in March and April, the stock remains up nearly 30% over the past 12 months. The recent decline reduced its P/E to 19, which is lower than its industry average of 25 and compares favorably to its projected earnings growth.
Are any of these stocks worthy buys?
NantHealth, Unisys, and Finisar all posted big declines this month, but one stock is clearly a more promising pick than the other two. NantHealth is trying to sell a test that physicians aren't eager to buy, and Unisys is posting big losses in a struggling industry. That makes Finisar -- which is still posting solid double-digit sales and earnings growth -- the only stock I'd consider buying out of these three beaten-down stocks.

",The 3 Worst Performing Tech Stocks in April
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/26/gaming-investors-rejoice-sony-stock-wins-its-buy-r.aspx,2017-04-26,"
Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...
The final week of April is turning into a big week for gamers -- and for investors in the gaming industry. This morning, StreetInsider.com reports that analysts at Pacific Crest announced they are reinitiating coverage of four stocks in the video gaming sector, and assigning three of them -- Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) -- ratings of overweight.
Digital downloads are reshaping the gaming industry, says Pacific Crest, and allowing EA, Activision, and Take-Two to reap rich rewards -- and better data from their customers. All three of these stocks have gained more than 40% over the past 52 weeks, but Pacific Crest argues that ""the party is not over yet"" for video game makers.
And here's another thing you should know: One analyst thinks the party is just getting started for Electronic Arts', Activision's, and Take-Two's most important partner: Sony (NYSE:SNE). Here's why.

Sony is getting ready to grab profits from virtual reality -- with both hands. Image source: Getty Images.

1. Actually (and virtually) the best
While outperforming the S&P 500 over the past year (rising 31% to the S&P's 13% gain), Sony stock hasn't yet achieved the gains accruing to EA, Activision, or Take-Two. But that could soon change, argue the analysts at investment banker Bernstein.
This is because in the nascent market for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) gaming, there's really no one that approaches Sony's dominance of the market -- and at any level. Starting at the most obvious, Sony makes the PlayStation 4 gaming console, of which there are already 53.4 million units in circulation.
That gives Sony a 51% market share in consoles worldwide. Its nearest competition, Microsoft, has only managed to sell 27.6 million units of Xbox One. Accordingly, the Redmond giant's 26% market share in consoles is barely half the size of Sony's.
2. Why physical consoles matter to virtual reality
As Bernstein explains in a note covered by TheFly.com yesterday, by owning the console market, Sony has created for itself an installed base of machines to which it can tether its VR headgear. Simply put, if you want to use a Sony VR headset, you need to have a PlayStation -- and vice versa.
This strong grip on the VR market, says Bernstein, both ""strengthen[s] the PlayStation ecosystem"" and guarantees Sony ""the leading position in tethered VR for the next three years at least.""




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-21379');
            });
        

3. Speaking of ecosystems
What really gets Bernstein excited about Sony stock, of course, is this ecosystem it describes, in which Sony's ""vertical integration"" allows it to leverage its ""unchallenged position"" in consoles to win sales and earn profits at all levels of the VR gaming market.
Downstream from consoles, in addition to running games from EA, Activision, and Take-Two on its PlayStation 4 consoles, Sony also publishes games of its own that it can sell to PlayStation users.
Upstream, the company is also ""the largest image sensor maker"" in the industry. This gives Sony the twin advantages of being able to buy its own sensors without paying an extra bit of profit margin to an outside vendor (thus lowering its costs) at the same time as Sony is able to derive additional revenue from selling image sensors to its rivals -- with a mark-up.
The most important thing: Valuation
All of the above, thinks Bernstein, adds up to a fine buy thesis for Sony stock. Bernstein believes that while Sony will earn only $0.51 per share this fiscal year, the company's profits will expand rapidly as the virtual reality and augmented reality markets mature. Just one year from now, in fact, Bernstein believes Sony could be earning as much as $2.14 per share, per year -- a fourfold increase. But is that enough profit to make Sony stock a buy, even after its 31% run-up in price?
Let's find out.
With negative net income from fiscal 2016, we pretty much have to take Bernstein's predictions on faith if we want to value Sony stock on GAAP earnings. Doing so, dividing $0.51 in projected current-year earnings into Sony's $33.57 stock price, we arrive at a current year price-to-earnings ratio of 65.8 -- which seems kind of pricey. Granted, next year's profits of $2.14 -- if they materialize -- will drop the company's forward P/E down to just 15.7, and that's a much more palatable level for a stock that, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence's polled analysts, is likely to grow earnings at 18% annualized over the next five years.
Still not convinced? Then look at Sony from the perspective of free cash flow. Last year, Sony generated cash profits of $3.1 billion. Sony stock has a $42.6 billion market capitalization, $4.9 billion in net cash on its balance sheet, and thus an enterprise value of $37.7 billion. That gives Sony stock an enterprise value-to-free-cash-flow ratio of just 12.2 today. And this is a valuation that looks cheap relative to the 18% projected growth rate.
Long story short, maybe you buy Bernstein's projected fourfold increase in GAAP profit by 2018, maybe you don't -- and you don't have to. Based on the free cash flow it is generating right now, I think Sony stock is already a buy today.

",Gaming Investors Rejoice! Sony Stock Wins a Buy Rating
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/25/2-incredibly-cheap-dividend-stocks-to-buy-now.aspx,2017-04-25,"
Buying cheaply valued dividend stocks is a move that combines two well-known schools of investing. When followed properly, both stock-picking techniques have been shown to outperform the market averages,  although success lies in skilled execution as much as anything else.
Making matters more complicated for retail investors, of course, is that many stocks trading at discounts to the market have seen their share prices cut for good reasons. However, a rare few really are mispriced, which creates opportunities for investors to pick up shares of quality, dividend stocks on the cheap.
Right now, both General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Graham Holdings (NYSE:GHC) are trading below their intrinsic values based on common ratios, and may represent just such cheap dividend stock investment opportunities.

General Motors
GM's place in this piece is topical on several levels. In terms of raw stats, the automaker easily fits the bill, trading at a lowly 5 times earnings -- the lowest valuation in the S&P 500  -- and yielding 4.5%.  This aspect of GM's appearance is fairly self-explanatory. General Motors emerged from its financial-crisis-era bailout a stronger, more focused company. Better still, the broader automotive market has also demonstrated impressive strength.  However, GM's shares are trading as if some new crisis was waiting in the wings, much to some investors' chagrin.
Late last month, well-known hedge fund Greenlight Capital  published a proposal to address GM's valuation issues by splitting the company's shares into a dual-class stock structure. Per the proposal, GM stock would divide on a one-to-one basis into ""dividend shares"" and ""capital appreciation shares,"" a move that Greenlight estimates could drive between 24% and 72% upside from its current trading range.

            });

The dividend shares would begin by distributing GM's current $1.52 dividend and would be priced by the market to yield somewhere between 7% and 9%, according to Greenlight's reckoning. The capital appreciation shares would be entitled to any excess profits beyond those paid out by to owners of the dividend shares. Given GM's low 25% payout ratio, it seems the automaker has plenty of profits to go around. Of course, this would be a significant undertaking. However, the proposal does correctly emphasize that GM has a valuation problem.
Graham Holdings
A recommendation in one of The Fool's premium newsletter services, Graham Holdings -- formerly the Washington Post Company, prior to the sale of its eponymous newspaper to Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos -- requires some attention to detail to analyze. However, those inclined sift through the company's particulars will find a high-quality business trading at an unjustifiably cheap valuation.
The company operates three divisions: media, education, and other. Its media segment owns and operates seven local TV broadcast stations in major U.S.metropolitan areas.  Those assets generate the majority of Graham's operating profits -- $200.5 million of its $303.5 million (66%) in FY 2016 -- despite accounting for just $409.7 million of its $2.4 billion (16%) total revenues.  
Its education business encompasses all the operations of the Kaplan education brand, such as Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Test Prep, and Kaplan International.  This segment has struggled lately, especially in its higher education areas, but management has stated education should produce double-digit operating margins over the long term.  Graham's ""other"" segment includes a diverse mix of growth businesses and acquisitions, but it isn't necessarily important to understand everything going on within it to comprehend the company's current investment thesis.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-49047');
            });
        


Compare its business results to its valuation, and things start to get interesting. Graham's current $3.3 billion market capitalization values the company at 11 times its operating profit. Critically though, Graham Holdings enjoys a gold-plated balance sheet, sporting over $600 million in net cash and $860 million in overfunded pension assets.  Backing these out from the company's market value indicates investors today can purchase the operating business at a multiple of about 6 times operating earnings -- an absolute steal.
Culturally, its management maintains a highly Foolish -- with a capital F -- long-term attitude toward growing shareholder value. In fact, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet was a longtime member of its board of directors; Berkshire retains a small stake in Graham Holdings.
The company isn't necessarily an income investors' delight. It currently yields just 0.8%, though its 16% payout ratio gives it considerable room to increase payouts in the future.  Looking at the company's rock-bottom valuation and its potential for increased capital return, Graham Holdings certainly fits the bill of a cheap dividend stock that deserves investors' consideration today. 
",2 Incredibly Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy Now
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/27/better-buy-hp-inc-vs-international-business-machin.aspx,2017-04-27,"
HP (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) are often considered mature tech plays that are owned for stability and income instead of growth. However, shares of HP have surged nearly 50% over the past 12 months, easily crushing the S&P 500's 14% gain and IBM's 8% growth during the same period. Let's discuss why HP flourished as IBM floundered, and whether or not both stocks will continue on their current trajectories this year.
How HP and IBM evolved
HP and IBM have both evolved significantly over the past few years. HP split with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) in late 2015. After that split, HP retained the company's PC, printing, and imaging businesses, while HPE retained the enterprise hardware and software units. The PC and printing markets seem like slow-growth ones, but HP is carving out new niches in both markets with premium laptops, 2-in-1 devices, mobile printers, and industrial 3D printers.

IBM has shrunk itself by divesting many of its non-core assets. It sold its PC and x86 server businesses to Lenovo, paid GlobalFoundries to take over its chip manufacturing business, and divested other lower-margin businesses. It then invested its cash into its five higher-growth ""strategic imperatives"" of cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security-related businesses. Big Blue's core strategy is to grow those five businesses fast enough to offset ongoing declines at its aging IT services, hardware, and software businesses.
How fast are HP and IBM growing?
HP and IBM are both slow-growth companies. HP's revenue fell 6% to $48.2 billion last year, but analysts expect 1% growth this year. That slight recovery is attributed to warming sales of PCs, which boosted its Personal Systems (PC) revenues by 10% annually to $8.2 billion during the first quarter. That growth was mainly supported by rising demand for its premium convertibles, detachables, and thinner devices with longer-lasting batteries. 
HP's printing revenue fell 3% annually to $4.5 billion during the quarter, due to weak growth in commercial hardware and supply sales. However, HP also noted that sales of its mobile printers (for smartphones) were robust, that big enterprise customers were placing orders for its new 3D printers, and that its planned takeover of Samsung's printing business would enable the business to scale up.
IBM's revenue has declined annually for 20 consecutive quarters, indicating that the growth of its strategic imperatives still isn't offsetting declines in its older businesses, which are weighed down by sluggish enterprise spending and competition from nimbler rivals. Big Blue's total revenues dropped 2% annually to $79.9 billion last year, and analysts anticipate another 2% decline this year.

Last quarter, IBM's strategic imperatives revenue rose 12% annually to $7.8 billion and accounted for 42% of its revenue over the past 12 months. But that growth still didn't prevent its total revenue from dropping 3% to $18.2 billion for the quarter. The only bright spot was that its Cognitive Solutions revenue -- which includes its closely watched Watson and cloud AI businesses -- rose by 2%. Meanwhile, revenue at all of its other main business segments (business services, technology services and cloud platforms, systems, and global financing) declined year-over-year.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-94345');
            });
        

Profitability, dividends, and valuations
HP and IBM both use buybacks to boost their earnings. HP spent $702 million, or 19% of its free cash flow (FCF), on buybacks over the past 12 months. IBM spent $3.68 billion, or 32% of its FCF, on buybacks during the same period. 
That's how HP grew its non-GAAP earnings by 10% in fiscal 2016. But looking ahead, analysts expect that figure to rise less than 1% this year and about 5% next year. IBM's non-GAAP earnings fell 9% in fiscal 2016 (due to a gradual decline in buybacks), and analysts anticipate less than 1% growth this year and 2% growth next year.
Both companies have plenty of cash to fund their dividends. HP pays a forward yield of 2.9%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 33%. IBM pays a forward yield of 3.5%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 44%. Those low payout ratios indicate that both companies have plenty of room to raise their dividends.
HP trades at just 12 times earnings, which is much lower than its industry average of 20. IBM trades at 13 times earnings, which is also a discount to its industry average of 19. However, HP's price-to-sales ratio of 0.7 is significantly lower than IBM's P/S ratio of 1.9.
The winner: HP
It's a close call, but a simpler business model, a recovering PC market, and an evolving printing business all make HP a better buy than IBM at current prices. IBM offers a better dividend, but its strategy of growing its strategic imperatives to offset slowdowns at its other aging businesses simply isn't paying off yet.

The stock market shook off much of the unease that seems to have plagued the market last week, even as geopolitical tensions continued to rise today. Financial, industrial, and technology sectors led the way, with healthcare and energy sectors still positive but lagging other sectors. As for individual stocks, a series of after-market earnings and a decision from the FDA drove price changes today.

FDA denies drugmakers
Shares of drugmakers Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Incyte Corp. (NASDAQ:INCY) both took an early morning plunge after news that the Food and Drug Administration rejected a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug called baricitinib. Lilly and Incyte announced their exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement back in 2009 for the development and commercialization of baricitinib, which was submitted for regulatory review in January 2016 amid hopes that it could be a top drug in its category. 
The companies said they would dispute the rejection, meaning their payday could still come. Christi Shaw, president of Lilly Bio-Medicines, said in a statement: ""We remain confident in the benefit/risk of baricitinib as a new treatment option for adults with moderate to severe RA. We will continue to work with the FDA to determine a path forward and ultimately bring baricitinib to patients in the U.S.""

Chipotle announces price increases
Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has been a tough stock to own over the past few years, as its issues with e. coli contamination decimated store traffic and same-store revenue growth. The stock is still down about 30% over the past two years, but so far in 2017 it's doing much better -- up around 25% year to date. Shares were on the rise again today, after the company announced that it will raise prices on its items for the first time in about three years.
Today's price increase takes place at about 20% of total locations and boosts prices about 5%. Chipotle has tried various tactics to grow traffic again, such as online games that win customers free food. While this price change is a relatively small move, it could help keep positive momentum going for the quick-serve burrito maker to boost comparable-store sales throughout 2017. 
Earnings season in focus
The market was positive while anticipating the Q1 earnings release from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) today after the market closed, and the stock had risen by around 3% by the end of the trading day. Netflix reported about $2.64 billion in sales and $0.40 in earnings per share, beating analyst estimates, and the stock was continuing to move higher about 30 minutes into after-hours trading, a good sign for the day to come. 
United Continental (NYSE:UAL) is another stock that moved higher throughout the day as Wall Street waited for earnings. Untied delivered on those higher expectations, reporting sales of $8.4 billion and earnings per share of $0.31 for the quarter. The airline also said it expects capacity to continue growing nicely in 2017. The results follow the company's public lashing after a video emerged of a passenger who was forcibly removed from an overbooked flight, and that incident could still drag on Q2 and full-year earnings if the public-relations fallout affects bookings or rewards-program enrollments. 
Earnings season has officially kicked off, and investors are eagerly awaiting more companies' reports in the days ahead -- including a few important bank companies this week, and the biggest names in tech next week. Still, one of the biggest market movers could be what happens this week amid growing political and military tension across various parts of the world.

Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, especially high-yield ones, can be one of the best investment tools for income investors. That's because dividend ETFs not only offer the advantages of diversification but also make investing a bit easier, as you can hold a basket of stocks without having to monitor them constantly. In a low-rate, volatile environment like today's, such high-yield ETFs can prove particularly useful for income-hungry investors.
But with so many dividend ETFs to choose from, it's easy to get confused. Moreover, not all high-yield ETFs are safe. So to help you make sound investing decisions, our contributors have picked three high-yield ETFs that they believe could power up your portfolio: Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM), iShares Core High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:HDV), and WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund (NYSEMKT:DES). Read along to learn more.
Diversified exposure and low expenses
Keith Noonan (Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF): The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF offers investors solid income generation and exposure to a wide range of leading American companies at very low cost. The fund tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, holds 415 dividend-paying stocks, and is mostly comprised of high-yield large-cap companies. It currently yields 2.9% -- which is roughly 50% higher than the average yield of the S&P 500 index.

While VYM is one of the most diversified dividend-focused ETFs on the market, it's still largely comprised of blue chip companies, and its 10 largest holdings account for roughly a third of the fund's assets. The fund's top five holdings by weight are Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo, and eight of its top 10 holdings are also components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. 
Accounting for dividend reinvestments, VYM's total return has been roughly in line with the S&P 500 index over the last five- and 10-year periods, and the fund has very low management fees. VYM's expense ratio comes in at just 0.08%, or $8 annually for every $10,000 invested, which Vanguard says is 93% lower than the average expense ratio of funds with similar holdings.  
With broad diversification and low expenses, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF stands out as an advisable way for investors to quickly establish a position in income-generating stocks across a wide range of sectors. 
A treasure trove of blue chip dividend stocks 
Neha Chamaria (iShares Core High Dividend): iShares Core High Dividend ETF is among my favorite dividend ETFs for several reasons, including a solid basket of stocks and an incredibly low expense ratio. As its name suggests, this ETF focuses on high-yield stocks, tracking the Morningstar Dividend Yield Focus Index, which owns 75 top high-yield stocks of companies with an economic moat that can sustain and grow their dividends.
That means the iShares Core High Dividend ETF provides double-edged security: high yields and growing dividends. Also, the ETF's portfolio is as diversified as it can get. As of April 14, 2017, consumer staples stocks constituted 23.83% of its portfolio, while energy, healthcare, telecommunications, and information technology each made up between 12% and 16% of the portfolio. Among sectors, financials has the lowest exposure, which is actually a boon for investors during a rising interest-rate environment. Not surprisingly, this ETF holds some top-notch stocks, including ExxonMobil, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Philip Morris, among others.
Dividends from a portfolio chockablock with such blue chip names are expected to be good, and that's exactly how it has been, which is why total returns from the iShares Core High Dividend ETF since inception have been way higher than the S&P 500's.

The best part is that this ETF also has a rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.08%, making it one of the cheapest ETFs in the space. The low expense, combined with a dividend yield of 3.4%, makes this one of the best high-yield ETFs you can find today.

A winning combination
Tim Brugger (WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund): It should be noted that WisdomTree's small-cap dividend fund may not be ideal as a large portion of a portfolio, particularly for investors who are quite risk-averse. Small-cap stocks often result in short-term fluctuations, though they offer long-term growth potential.
That said, this ETF is not your ordinary small-cap investment. For starters, its focus is income, and it's done a great job generating strong yields from small-cap stocks. WisdomTree pays shareholders a 3.72% dividend yield and with its emphasis on small-ish stocks also offers appreciation upside.
The small-cap label shouldn't scare investors off, because a full 40% of the fund's portfolio consists of companies valued between $2 billion and $10 billion. Not huge by some standards, but not exactly mom-and-pop companies either. The balance of the portfolio are stocks valued under $2 billion.
What also makes WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund intriguing, aside from its nearly 4% dividend, is its historical performance. A $10,000 investment made 10 years ago -- right about the time WisdomTree's ETF became available -- would be worth $23,817 today. The impressive ETF has also beaten the Russell 2000 index -- which is largely made up of small-cap stocks -- each of the last 12-month, three-year, five-year, and 10-year periods.
This year WisdomTree's small-cap dividend fund is up 31.4% compared to 21.31% for its index benchmark, the Russel 2000. Does it warrant a predominant position in a portfolio? Maybe not, but a strong dividend yield and growth potential are needed to take a portfolio to the next level, and this ETF fits the bill.

But what, exactly, makes these two newsletters different, and how can they benefit you?

How Stock Advisor has destroyed the market
Supported by their own respective teams of talented analysts, Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner stand tall at the helm of Stock Advisor. Every month, Team David and Team Tom each recommend a stock -- whether it's a new company or from their pool of hundreds of previous picks -- that they believe Stock Advisor subscribers would do well to consider buying. Each team also provides updates as needed on previous picks that they believe should be put on ""hold"" for temporary concerns, or sold if they no longer believe in its prospects as a market-beating investment.
In addition, Team Tom and Team David each provide a list of their own ""Best Buys Now"" once per month. These lists contain five companies from their pool of existing Stock Advisor picks that represent timely opportunities for your new investing dollars. Stock Advisor also maintains a list of ""Starter Stocks,"" or strong companies that they believe can form the foundation of any well-rounded portfolio.
Collectively, there are several overarching principles that guide both teams' Stock Advisor approach:

Buy businesses, not tickers. Recognize that underlying the ticker symbols are real businesses generating revenue and profits from actual products. 
Be a lifetime investor. Take a long-term view of investing, which means keeping track of the news, earnings reports, and industries surrounding the stocks they recommend.
Diversify. Building a diversified portfolio helps protect against volatility, and lets Stock Advisor members sleep better at night.
Fish where others aren't. Don't follow the crowd, which means thinking for yourself and doing your own research.
Check emotions at the door. Be prepared to calmly endure, comprehend, and potentially take advantage of big swings in the share prices of your stocks.
Keep score. Stock Advisor members have access to the performance of all previous picks at any time, dating back to David's and Tom's earliest recommendations in 2002.
Be Foolish (with a capital ""F"") and have fun. Investing isn't as hard as it sounds. Stock Advisor believes individual investors outperform their brokers and enjoy themselves along the way.

But Team Tom and Team David also employ their own unique methods to fine-tune this approach. 
For example, Team David strives to find companies that are not only poised to benefit from ""undeniable, long-term trends,"" but also have a certain level of ""unquantifiable greatness"" -- that is, a secret sauce that gives them an edge, and more often wins the love of consumers as a result. David wants to be able to get in early on these great businesses, and has no problem adding to his positions as these winners keep winning over the long term.
And Team Tom first looks for great companies operating in beaten-down (but still relevant) industries. He also seeks those with strong financials and a proven business model, as well as shareholder-friendly management teams. Signs of the latter tend to include high levels of insider ownership, and reasonable compensation structures.

",Stock Newsletters: Motley Fool Stock Advisor vs. Rule Your Retirement
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/20/earnings-2-tech-stocks-to-watch-next-week.aspx,2017-04-20,"
Earnings season is well under way, and a handful of big names are on deck. Next week's earnings releases notably include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) -- two tech stocks that could see big moves.
Here's what investors should watch when Twitter reports its results on Wednesday, April 26, and Alphabet reports on Thursday, April 27. 

Image source: Getty Images.

Can Twitter restore investor confidence?
Going into Twitter's first-quarter report, investors seem to have little confidence in the company's ability to turnaround its business. With shares trading at $14.54 at the time of this writing, they're less than a dollar away from an all-time low of $13.73 and are down 15.1% in the past three months. Twitter's worse-than-expected revenue in its most recent quarter, combined with slow revenue growth recently, has set the bar low.
Analysts have a gloomy outlook for the quarter. On average, analysts expect Twitter to report revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $513 million and $0.01, respectively, down from $595 million and $0.15 in the year-ago quarter.
In Twitter's fourth-quarter shareholder letter, management said it's seen ""increased competitive pressure resulting in a decline in our original Promoted Tweet engagement format."" With Facebook's popularity with advertisers showing no signs of letting up, and the social network continuing to rapidly innovate with its ad products across its core Facebook app and Instagram, competitive pressure could continue to hurt Twitter.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-87924');
            });
        


Investors should look for management to provide some concrete evidence of a turnaround.
Will Alphabet live up to high expectations?
Unlike with Twitter, investors have high expectations for Alphabet when the company reports first-quarter results on Thursday. Look no further than the stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 30 for insight into just how bullish investors are on the company's growth potential. This P/E ratio is well above the average P/E ratio of 24.5 of stocks in the S&P 500 and tech peer Apple's P/E ratio of 16.9.
On average, analysts expect Alphabet to report revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $24.2 billion and $7.38, respectively. While analysts' consensus estimate for non-GAAP EPS is below non-GAAP EPS of $7.50 in the year-ago quarter, investors should keep in mind that Alphabet is no longer excluding stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP results starting with its first quarter of 2017. So it makes sense that Alphabet's non-GAAP EPS would decline year over year. Analysts' consensus estimate for Alphabet's revenue is a better reflection of the company's growth. A consensus estimate for revenue of $24.2 billion is up 19.4% year over year.
Beyond Alphabet's total revenue growth and its adjusted EPS, investors may want to look out for any commentary from management about mobile search and YouTube -- two areas of the company's business that have served as key catalysts for growth recently.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-87853');
            });
        


In addition, investors should look for an update on Alphabet's ""other bets"" revenue. While still representing only a fraction of total revenue, the segment saw its revenue soar 75% in the company's most recent quarter, hitting $262 million. Further, its operating loss narrowed from $1.2 billion to $1.1 billion.
Twitter reports its first-quarter results before the market opens on Wednesday, and Alphabet reports its first-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday. Stay tuned to The Motley Fool for analysis of these two tech companies' earnings reports after they go live. 
",Earnings: 2 Tech Stocks to Watch Next Week
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/24/1-hated-dividend-stock-to-buy-now.aspx,2017-04-24,"
The North Face jackets. Timberland boots. SmartWool socks. Vans shoes. What do all of these have in common?
They are all products owned by VFCorporation (NYSE:VFC), and combined with other outdoor and action products, they brought in over $7.5 billion in sales last year. The company is a clothing conglomerate with a bevy of steady and reliable brands.

Image source: VF Corporation.

And yet, over the past 18 months, Wall Street has hated this stock. Shares have underperformed the S&P 500 by 38 percentage points. While that's discouraging, it also presents a unique opportunity: the chance to buy a safe and growing dividend that's now yielding over 3%. Here's why it's a pretty good deal.
What's to blame for the drop? The death of malls
Despite a strong roster of brands, VF isn't immune to the death of malls in America. As e-commerce gobbles up more and more of the retail pie, companies selling products via the mall have suffered. And slower traffic alone isn't the only problem: As retail stores adjust to this new reality, they are ordering far less inventory, magnifying the effects on VF's wholesale business.
While growth was slow heading into 2016, it was at least positive. But that trend reversed last year, with the wholesale business declining by almost 3% as fewer and fewer people were shopping at malls.
That, combined with some goodwill write-offs and the decision to restructure the company's lucy branded women's clothes with The North Face division, combined to bring earnings down 8% last year.
The silver lining: weakness comes from sales channels, not the brands themselves
What we have here, then, is a business in transition. The old forms for selling products are drying up, and VF needs to transition into new lines. Already, it has been doing that. The company's direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel includes both VF-operated stores and e-commerce. And it has been growing steadily -- annualized at over 11% -- for the past five years.
Compare how the wholesale and DTC lines have diverged.

Data source: Annual reports. 
Just as importantly, international customers can't seem to get enough of VF's brands. Back in 2014, the company counted $3.6 billion in international sales. Last year, that figure was $5.4 billion -- a 50% jump in just 24 months. 
Of course, the problem is that the wholesale business still makes up over 70% of all sales. Over time, though, I believe two things will happen. First, more and more sales will migrate to the DTC channel -- which is not only more reliable, but offers higher margins. Second, I believe the wholesale business will eventually stabilize, making the gradual transition to DTC easier on shareholders.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-66230');
            });
        

Collecting a fat dividend all the while
In the meantime, investors buying in today get the benefit of a 3% dividend yield that is very safe. When it comes to dividends, the most important thing to keep an eye on is free cash flow (FCF) -- the amount of money a company puts into its pocket every year, minus capital expenditures. It is from FCF that dividends are paid, and investors never want to see the latter outstripping the former.

Data source: Annual reports.
While the company's FCF has been variable from year to year, management has never used more than 60% of it to pay the dividend. And last year, it used less than half. That means that the company's 3.1% yield is very safe and has lots of room to grow.
In fact, VF has raised its dividend for 44 consecutive years. That means while you're getting a 3.1% dividend yield this year, it could be substantially higher -- relative to today's purchase price -- in a decade.
For instance, investors who bought shares in 2007 got a 2.5% dividend yield. But based on the original purchase price back then, the dividend they are getting now is yielding 7.6% based on their original purchase price.
That's why income investors should look carefully at buying shares of VF. The company owns valuable brands that have proven themselves over the years and are growing in importance internationally. While the transition for U.S. wholesale to DTC will be painful, patient investors could be rewarded handsomely.

",1 Hated Dividend Stock to Buy Now
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/27/the-dow-would-be-more-than-300-points-higher-this.aspx,2017-04-27,"
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) is one of the America's oldest stock indexes, and it's easily the country's most iconic. It's comprised of 30 huge multinational corporations, all of which have demonstrated a penchant for creating shareholder value over the long run.
The Dow's fatal flaw
However, this popular index also has a pretty sizable shortcoming that some investors tend to overlook. Unlike the broad-based S&P 500, which moves up and down based on the share-price movements of its roughly 500 companies and their respective market-cap weightings, the Dow Jones is a purely point-based index. This means that companies with a higher share price have more influence on the Dow than those with a lower share price, regardless of market cap.

Image source: Getty Images.

For example, conglomerate General Electric is the sixth-largest company represented in the Dow, with a market cap of roughly $260 billion. But its share price is less than $30. Based on the current Dow divisor, which translates the share prices of Dow components into the point value that we follow as investors, GE's share price contributes just 202 of the Dow's 20,548 points, the closing value as of Friday, April 21. That's not even a full 1%. Yet, a company we'll be discussing in a moment that has just 30% of the market cap of GE also has seven times its influence in the Dow, all because of share price.
In fact, through Friday, the Dow would be 308 points higher if the following three companies were merely flat for the year instead of down between 9% and 11%.
Goldman Sachs -- 154.70 year-to-date Dow points
Though it doesn't happen often, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) missed Wall Street's expectations by a wide margin in the first quarter, and that's the primary reason it's shaved nearly 155 points off the Dow year to date. It's also the aforementioned company that has seven times as much influence on the Dow as GE based solely on its share price.

Image source: Getty Images.

For the first quarter, Goldman wound up reporting $5.15 per share in EPS on $8.03 billion in revenue. Comparatively, Wall Street was looking for $420 million more in revenue and $0.16 more in earnings per share. Goldman attributed its subpar results to weakness in certain market segments. For instance, even though investment banking revenue scorched higher by 16% year over year, revenue from fixed income was flat, while equity revenue dipped 6% on account of weaker volumes in the United States.
The low interest rate environment continues to hold back Goldman Sachs, which is listed as a bank in name, but is really an investment institution by practice. The good news is that at least the Federal Reserve is in the midst of tightening monetary policy, albeit slowly. As rates rise, investor demand for fixed-income assets will likely improve as well. This should reduce market volatility and give the king of bonds, Goldman Sachs, some healthy profits.
But it's going to take time before the bond market is a boon once again for Goldman Sachs. In the interim, it's been quite the drag on the Dow in 2017.




            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-36592');
            });
        

Chevron -- 87.72 year-to-date Dow points
Integrated oil and gas companies have regularly taken it on the chin over the past three years. Surprisingly, though, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has held up better than many of its peers. Its geographic diversity and ability to cut costs probably played a key role in its ability to withstand sinking crude oil prices.

Image source: Getty Images.

However, in 2017 Chevron has been notably weaker. On a pure percentage basis, Chevron is the worst-performing stock in the Dow year to date, and it's removed almost 88 Dow points. The failure of crude prices to move higher is one reason Chevron is struggling. Despite cuts from OPEC that were expected to reduce supply and help buoy crude prices, U.S. crude and gasoline inventories hit an all-time record high in mid-February. This picture paints the need for more production cuts in the future, and more importantly, shows there is no quick fix for crude oil prices.
The other issue for Chevron is that its fourth-quarter earnings results, released earlier this year, weren't very encouraging. Despite the company's $415 million in net income during Q4 2016, there were a handful of disappointments. For instance, Chevron's operating cash flow is still not high enough to cover the costs of paying out its dividend. Chevron has admittedly worked hard to become a Dividend Aristocrat (i.e., a company that's increased its payout for 25 or more consecutive years) and likely doesn't want to give up that title, but it's being forced to issue debt to cover a portion of its payouts at the moment.
Additionally, the company's U.S. downstream operations produced no earnings as a result of a 21% decline in per-day output, which Chevron blamed on planned turnaround activity at its refinery in Richmond, California.
The good news for investors is that Chevron still has plenty of cost-cutting channels left, as well as numerous projects that are poised to boost production over the long term. However, an ongoing crude supply glut is a problem that isn't likely to be resolved anytime soon.
ExxonMobil -- 65.54 year-to-date Dow points
Finally, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is in much the same boat as Chevron. Its stock has held up far better than many of its peers, but rising U.S. crude and gasoline inventories clearly have investors concerned. This year hasn't been so kind to big oil stocks, with ExxonMobil removing more than 65 points from the Dow in 2017.

Image source: Pixabay.

Though ExxonMobil's fourth-quarter report was a bit more upbeat than Chevron's -- after all, it was able to cover its dividend payouts with cash flow generated from operations and asset sales -- it still came with some clear downsides.
For instance, ExxonMobil wound up taking an impairment charge of about $2 billion in its U.S. upstream segment that was tied to undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountains. The company also saw its full-year 2016 earnings hit by weaker refining margins, although this was a sectorwide issue last year. And, for those shareholders who've become accustomed to ExxonMobil being exceptionally generous with share buybacks, there's been a notable decline in the number of shares it's repurchasing.
Like Chevron, ExxonMobil has the ability to reduce its expenditures to account for weakened demand or modestly lower commodity prices. Its Q4 2016 capital expenditures were down 35% from the prior-year quarter, to $4.8 billion. These are the types of steep cuts that may be needed if ExxonMobil wants to keep its healthy dividend firmly in place.
ExxonMobil has ample projects underway to boost production in the years to come, but without oil industry dynamics favoring the company, it could be tough sledding in 2017.

The primary goals of anyone who buys stocks should be the same: to predictably generate wealth and beat the market in the process. But the latter is easier said than done, considering the S&P 500's historical annual returns of roughly 10%. Yet by focusing on relatively small, unknown companies, the Motley Fool Hidden Gems newsletter has consistently done just that. Since its inception in 2004, Hidden Gems' stocks have climbed 59%, on average, helping subscribers beat the market by more than 6% in the process. (Returns are as of April 20, 2017.)
But as much fun as that can be, life isn't all about just picking great stocks. That's why the Motley Fool Rule Your Retirement newsletter has served as a guiding light for investors as they work to accumulate a nest egg and manage their finances through a crucial time in their lives.
Let's take a closer look, then, at what sets these two investing newsletters apart, and how can you benefit from them.

Motley Fool co-founders David and Tom Gardner stand by all their flagship newsletters. IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL

How Hidden Gems finds diamonds in the rough
Hidden Gems is led by co-advisors and longtime Fools Seth Jayson and Andy Cross. Andy and Seth are supported by their own talented team, including senior analyst Michael Olsen, analyst Stan Huber, analyst Andrew Fredrickson, and analyst Abi Malin.
Together, they specialize in finding and recommending undervalued small-cap companies -- or those roughly defined as businesses with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion -- which they believe enjoy the potential to generate significant capital gains with a reasonable amount of risk for investors.
Perhaps just as important, Hidden Gems also looks at prospective recommendations with a long-term view, aiming to hold stocks for at least three years. Ideally, however, the team wants to identify publicly traded companies it can buy and hold forever.
Regarding that ""reasonable amount of risk,"" Hidden Gems subscribers should also be aware that shares of these smaller companies tend to be more volatile than their larger peers. But keeping in mind that volatility isn't always merited -- say, for example, when the market overreacts to a single disappointing quarterly report -- the Hidden Gems team is keenly aware that these movements can create opportunities for patient, long-term investors to buy these stocks at attractive prices.
At the same time, Hidden Gems also believes its members should practice regular investing to help diversify and smooth out these inevitable bumps in the road. That means putting money to work at least once per month to buy one or two stocks that appeal to you, and over the long term building a strong portfolio of at least 20 stocks Hidden Gems recommends. To that end, Hidden Gems maintains a list of ""Core"" portfolio stocks, offers monthly ""Best Buys Now,"" and presents two new recommendations each month, with regular updates on each recommended stock in real time.

The S&P 500 has been practically unstoppable over the trailing-12-month period, with the broad-based index up 15%. That's more than double its historic annual gain of 7%, inclusive of dividend reinvestment.
Unfortunately, some stocks have been left in the dust. There's usually a reason that a company underperforms the market, but it's up to investors to determine whether these reasons are business-altering events or temporary obstacles.

Image source: Getty Images.

Three value stocks to consider buying 
The term ""value stock"" has no universally agreed-upon definition, but I define it as a stock with a valuation that is substantially lower than the average of the broader market and its industry peers. Traditionally, either the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or PEG ratio is used to determine relative ""cheapness,"" with a single-digit P/E or a PEG ratio around or below 1 signaling a ""value stock.""
If you're on the lookout for deeply discounted value stocks this spring, then I'd suggest looking no further than the following three companies.
Express Scripts 
The first deeply discounted company that value investors would be wise to get on their radars is pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX). PBMs are the middlemen that negotiate drug pricing between insurance companies and drugmakers.
Over the trailing 12 months, Express Scripts' shares have fallen by nearly 5%, marking a 20% underperformance to the S&P 500 over the same period. The reason? Part of it has to do with the company's rocky relationship with national health insurer Anthem. Both companies have sued each other over a contract dispute, and there's fear that Express Scripts could lose its contract with Anthem when all is said and done.
The other concern is that President Trump may introduce a prescription drug reform bill, which if passed would reduce the price negotiating power of PBMs.

Image source: Getty Images.

While these are genuine concerns for Express Scripts, I'd be willing to argue that they don't merit a 20% underperformance to the broader market index.
To begin with, drug reform is probably not a point that Trump will be able to tackle with any success anytime soon. He has a full plate with trying to reform healthcare, pass individual and corporate tax reform, and implement an infrastructure spending bill. There's little time for drug reform. Plus, with most Republicans believing in a free market economy, there's little reason to think prescription drug reform is in the offing. This suggests that PBMs are safely ingrained as having significant pricing clout.
It's also worth noting that the long-term data is heavily in Express Scripts' favor. As prescription drugs grow pricier, insurers will lean on them more for their negotiating prowess. Being one of the largest, Express Scripts should remain a popular partner of health benefit providers. Plus, as the U.S. population ages, there's a strong likelihood that prescription drug consumption increases, too. This all bodes well for Express Scripts.
With the company now valued at less than 10 times this year's earnings per share and a PEG of roughly 1, it's the healthcare sector name that value investors should be strongly considering for their portfolios.

Whirlpool 
For you consumers, Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR), the largest appliance manufacturer in the world, is a deeply discounted value stock worth your consideration this spring.
After years of successful top- and bottom-line expansion, Whirlpool has hit a couple of recent growth hiccups that have caused skeptics to flee its stock. Over the trailing year, Whirlpool shares have fallen by 9%, implying a 24% underperformance to the broad-market index.
Among the issues Whirlpool has dealt with is weakness in Europe, some of which stems from Britain's upcoming exit from the European Union, and adverse currency fluctuations. The company wound up modestly reducing its full-year EPS forecast last year, which was a marked break from what had been a number of market-topping quarters.

Image source: Whirlpool.

On one hand, there's little denying that currency fluctuations and weakness in the EU has tempered growth for its appliances business. Then again, there are reasons to believe these are just temporary speed bumps for Whirlpool.
For starters, seasoned investors are going to be able to look beyond the company's currency-impacted top and bottom lines. We as investors care about how the company is performing from an operating perspective, and from this standpoint, everything seems to be moving along just fine. Total fourth-quarter sales grew by 1.7%, with the North American product line packing a punch with 8% sales growth. Shipments to North America are expected to grow by a healthy 5% at the midpoint in 2017.
Whirlpool's long-term strategy to infiltrate faster-growing emerging markets in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East is also completely unaffected by currency fluctuations and the growth hiccup caused by Brexit. Last year was Whirlpool's fifth straight year of record annual EPS, and while the North American market played a key role, 18% constant currency sales growth in Asia during the fourth quarter exemplifies the opportunity at hand in emerging markets. 
Currently sporting a forward P/E of a little more than 9, a PEG of 1, and a healthy dividend yield of 2.4%, Whirlpool looks to be a value investor's dream stock.
Sibanye Gold
Though it's not often an industry most investors would associate with deeply discounted value stocks, precious-metal miner Sibanye Gold (NYSE:SBGL) is a name that should catch value investors' eyes this spring.
Sibanye Gold, which operates in South Africa, has faced a number of near-term challenges. For instance, mining in Africa tends to be exceptionally costly, and there's always the ongoing fear of a politically induced shutdown or strike. Add to that the fact that gold prices per ounce tumbled from $1,360 to about $1,150 between the summer of 2016 and December 2016. This ultimately pushed Sibanye's stock lower by 40% over the trailing 12 months, which is good enough for a 55-percentage-point underperformance to the S&P 500.

Now for the good news: There are plenty of factors to suggest that physical gold prices could head higher. Even though interest rates are rising, which is normally a bad thing for gold since it increases the opportunity cost of owning gold as opposed to safer interest-bearing assets, inflation is rising, too. Higher inflation levels may be able to counteract the impact of higher interest rates. We're also seeing stronger demand for gold with supply of the lustrous yellow metal still somewhat constrained. That's often a recipe for higher spot prices, and thus higher margins for Sibanye Gold.
Beyond just physical gold, we've seen solid evidence from Sibanye that it can pull levers and cut its costs in order to generate positive cash flow and profits. In the fourth quarter, Sibanye reported an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of $954 an ounce for its gold division, pushing its operating profit 60% higher. In fact, Sibanye has had the lowest AISC of all major South African miners in 2016, as well as the highest dividend yield in the entire gold industry.
Sibanye has little coverage from Wall Street, but it looks to be valued at a PEG of near 1. If physical gold continues to rise in value and Sibanye can keep its costs under control, then its stock could certainly head a lot higher.

Financial stocks continued to trail the market after a quick run-up this year, and so the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) ended lower by 0.3%. Gold-based funds, meanwhile, attracted some of the heaviest trading volumes, and the volatile Direxion Junior Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:JNUG) gained 2% even as gold prices ticked down.
As for individual stocks, both Swift Transportation (NYSE:SWFT) and AT&T (NYSE:T) attracted heavy investor interest following merger and acquisition news.

Swift shares jump into high gear
Swift Transportation pre-announced details about its fiscal first quarter, but investors looked right past those figures to focus on the bigger news of the day: the trucking specialist's plan to merge with Knight Transportation. The two companies came to a deal that combines their businesses into an industry leader with $5 billion of annual revenue. It will operate under the name Knight-Swift Transportation and boast capacity of roughly 23,000 tractors and 77,000 trailers.
Swift shareholders are set to receive stock in the combined entity that, based on Knight's prior closing price, valued Swift at just over $22 per share. However, since Wall Street responded to Monday's news by bidding Knight's stock up as well, Swift's share price shot past that number to close at nearly $25, up almost 24% on the day.

The merger ""brings together the most robust, respected and reliable truckload providers in North America,"" Swift CEO Richard Stocking said in a press release. The company's founder and controlling stockholder, Jerry Moyes, added, ""I am confident that we have the right approach to maximizing the contribution of both teams.""
The deal is expected to close sometime in the third quarter, after which the companies project booking synergies of $100 million in 2018 and $150 million in 2019.

AT&T preps for 5G speeds
AT&T shares ticked half a percent lower after the telecom giant made a $1.6 billion investment into its high speed network. The company announced it is purchasing Straight Path Communications, one of the largest holders of 28 GHz and 39 GHz millimeter wave spectrum.
The move ""will support AT&T's leadership in 5G,"" the company explained in a press release, since it delivers licenses to valuable spectrum that covers the United States, including in all the top 40 markets. The International Telecommunications Union believes 5G technology could eventually deliver download speeds up to 20 Gbps.
It's also just one piece of a much larger capital investment program. AT&T has invested $27 billion in spectrum over the past five years. ""We have the premier spectrum position in the industry,"" CEO Randall Stephenson told investors in a a January earnings call.
AT&T structured the purchase as an all-stock deal, which is likely a win for the company given that its stock has outperformed the S&P 500 since 2016 and is currently valued at 19 times last year's earnings. Trading shares for Straight Path Communications thus frees up cash that the company can use to make future investments into preparing itself for ultra-high speed data demand. Investors can look for the acquisition to close sometime in the next 12 months following a review by the Federal Communications Commission.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/23/3-things-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-this-week.aspx,2017-04-23,"
Stocks rose last week as earnings season kicked into high gear. The uptick left both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) solidly higher for the year so far, but still below the records they set in early March.

^SPX data by YCharts.
Earnings season rolls on over the coming five trading days, and a few of the most anticipated reports set to be released will be from Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).
Chipotle's return to growth
Chipotle will release its fiscal first-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Tuesday. The struggling restaurant chain's stock is down sharply since late 2015, when its food safety scare stopped sales growth in its tracks and sent profits plunging.

CMG Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
However, shares have been on a spicy rally since the start of this year as hopes rise that a recovery is finally gaining steam. Chipotle in early February said that comparable-store sales spiked by 15% in the month of December when stacked against a prior-year period that was swamped by plunging store traffic. 
The sales comparisons will stay easy for a while, and in fact, Chipotle executives believe they'll manage comps increases in the high-single digits for fiscal 2017. A recent price increase, meanwhile, might indicate that the management team is seeing encouraging traffic trends. Investors this week will be focused on how that boost has been received by burrito fans, and how.
Amazon's long game
Online shopping juggernaut Amazon is set to announce its quarterly figures on Wednesday afternoon just as shares bounce along near record highs. The latest stock rally coincides with a huge increase in profits as annual net income soared to $2.4 billion in 2016 from $596 million in the year-ago period. 
Spiking earnings at Amazon Web Services played a big role in that surge, given that operating income in the division more than doubled to $3.1 billion. In contrast, Amazon booked just $2.4 billion in profits from its entire North American retailing operations last year.
CEO Jeff Bezos and his executive team issued a wide sales forecast for the current quarter that predicts growth of between 14% and 23%, equating to sales ranging from $33.25 billion to $35.75 billion. They expect operating profits to drop as low as $250 million compared with $1.1 billion last year as the company invests heavily in building out its market position in accordance with Bezos' extremely long-term focus.

Starbucks' customer traffic trends
Starbucks stock hasn't moved much in the past year as investors have struggled to get a reading on the coffee giant's global growth opportunity. On one hand, customer traffic is slowing, and profits recently fell in the key U.S. market thanks to rising labor costs. The restaurant giant is also going through a risky management transition as its founder and CEO steps aside to take a less direct role in the company.

On the other hand, Starbucks is targeting a massive footprint expansion, with 12,000 new locations set to open over the next five years -- one quarter of which are aimed at the booming Chinese market. The company is also bristling with sales and profit growth opportunities, including online ordering and delivery and a consumer products division that's seen its profit margin soar to 44% of sales from 38% in just the past year. 
The overall cloudy narrative could set the stage for a big move in the stock after Starbucks posts its quarterly results on Wednesday. If the latest operating trends support the company's optimistic reading on its long-term growth forecast, then shares could spike. A further traffic and profitability slowdown, meanwhile, would likely add to investors' worries that the business is in a funk that's not completely due to weak overall industry trends.

The market is clinging to reasonable gains so far in 2017. The S&P 500 is trading 5% higher year to date, but some stocks haven't been as fortunate.
Let's take a look at some of the investments that have burned investors this year. These three companies have seen their stocks shaved by more than half since the start of 2017. (The year-to-date returns are as of Tuesday's market close.)

Image source: Tailored Brands.

Tailored Brands -- Down 53%
This may not be a household name, but Tailored Brands (NYSE:TLRD) is the parent company of Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank, two names that snappy dressers know all too well. The big hit for Tailored Brands came in early March when the stock shed nearly a third of its value after posting uninspiring results for the holiday quarter. 
Tailored Brands posted lower net sales and a larger quarterly deficit than analysts were expecting. Comparable-store sales were negative at Men's Wearhouse. There was an uptick at Jos. A. Bank, but that was only because it was coming off of a brutal holiday quarter a year earlier.
Tailored Brands didn't help matters by unveiling weak guidance for the new fiscal year. It sees comps remaining negative in the near term. The silver lining here is that the pummeled stock has pushed the stock's yield to nearly 6%, but that beefy payout is only sustainable if Tailored Brands is able to get its businesses back on track.  
DryShips -- Down 96%
Dry-bulk vessels stocks have been slammed this year, and DryShips (NASDAQ:DRYS) can feel the pain. You know life is pretty bad when you've had to declare five reverse stocks splits over the past 13 months, including two so far in 2017. Revenue has fallen sharply for seven consecutive quarters, and you have to go all the way back to 2010 to find the last time that DryShips came through with an annual profit. 
DryShips is trying to make the most of the industry's frustrating fundamentals, including acquiring drybulk vessels of its fledgling peers. It also initiated a dividend policy in February, hoping that the payout could help stabilize the stock. We'll see if that does the trick.

Sportsman's Warehouse -- Down 52%
Internet retailers have been eating away at sporting-goods stores for years. Sports Authority shuttered the last of its stores last year. The climate has been marginally kinder for concepts focused on hunting and camping gear, but that doesn't mean that all of the remaining players are faring well. 
Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings (NASDAQ:SPWH) also took a big hit after a miss in its latest quarter. Comps declined 5.2% for the 78-unit chain of stores that's trying to keep a firm grasp on outdoor enthusiasts. Revenue grew as a result of a larger store count, but earnings declined, falling short of Wall Street targets on both ends of the income statement.
Its outlook is even worse. Sportsman's Warehouse expects to post a loss for the current quarter, with comps clocking in at 9% to 11% below prior-year's levels. Things aren't getting better, and that's why you can buy twice as many shares today as you could have when the year began for the same amount of money.

Retail real estate investment trust Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O), as you might expect, makes most of its money by buying and renting out retail properties. However, that doesn't really tell the whole story behind Realty Income's business model, and why the company has been able to develop one of the most consistent records of strong performance and dividend growth in the entire market.
The simple answer
Simply put, Realty Income makes the lion's share of its money from rental income, generated by its portfolio of more than 4,900 rental properties. According to the company's 2016 income statement, here's where the company's revenue came from last year:

Realty Income's business -- the two-minute version
For a little more color, let's take a look at the details of Realty Income's portfolio, and how it has managed to generate consistently market-beating returns for investors for decades.

Image source: Getty Images.

Realty Income is the largest net lease REIT in terms of both market capitalization and enterprise value, and is an S&P 500 company. The company primarily invests in freestanding retail properties (think Walgreens and Dollar General -- two of the top tenants), but also generates about 20% of its rental income from industrial and office properties, most of which are occupied by investment-grade tenants.
The majority of the company's tenants are recession-resistant, competition-resistant, or both, and can be classified into one or more of these three categories:

Non-discretionary retailers who sell things people need, not things they want. Examples from Realty Income's portfolio include Walgreens, Circle K, and 7-Eleven.
Deeply discounted retailers offer bargains that even most online retailers can't match, and many of these actually do better in tough economies. Wal-Mart, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Dollar General are three major Realty Income tenants.
Service-based retailers are immune to online competition, such as LA Fitness, AMC Theatres, and Lifetime Fitness.

The portfolio is also well-diversified by industry, as no single retail industry makes up more than 11.4% of the company's base rent. It is also geographically diversified, with properties in 49 states plus Puerto Rico.
Furthermore, Realty Income's net lease structure is designed for consistency and stability. Tenants sign leases with long initial terms (average of 14.7 years), which typically have gradual rent increases built in. These leases also require the tenants to cover most of the variable expenses of property ownership, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance. This lease structure produces excellent predictability, and is the main reason why Realty Income's same-store income rises so consistently.

Image source: Realty Income investor presentation.

In fact, per FactSet data, Realty Income is in the 98th percentile of all S&P 500 companies when it comes to return per unit of market risk (beta) since its 1994 NYSE listing.

The Foolish bottom line
Realty Income makes most of its money from one of the most reliable ways to invest in real estate. In fact, its low-risk business model has kept occupancy over 96% no matter what the economy was doing, and has allowed the company to pay 560 consecutive monthly dividends and increase its payments at a 4.7% annualized rate since its 1994 NYSE listing.

",How Realty Income Corporation Makes Most of Its Money
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/20/3-top-dividend-stocks-in-machine-learning.aspx,2017-04-20,"
Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can evoke reactions ranging from Elon Musk's ""summoning the demon"" claims to Bill Gates' likening it to the ""holy grail"" of computing.
Either way, machine learning and AI software represent one of the most impressive growth opportunities in tech today. Case in point: Researcher IDC sees AI and machine-learning software sales growing from a standing start into a $47 billion market by 2020. 
Investors want to know how they can cash in on this big-ticket trend. So let's review why dividend stocks such as International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offer investors compelling opportunities to invest in the rise of machine learning.
International Business Machines
IBM launched its Cognitive Systems business lineup in 2011,  the same year the company's Watson beat the all-time greats of the game show Jeopardy! Now the company's advanced learning platforms are becoming an increasingly important piece of Big Blue's business.
What most impresses me regarding products like Watson is their tremendous profitability. Cognitive Solutions enjoys by far the most lucrative top- and bottom-line margin structure of any of IBM's reporting segments. For comparison, IBM produced gross margin of 51% and pre-tax income margin of 24% in Q4 2016, which falls far short of the 82% gross profit margin and 38% pre-tax profit margin Cognitive Solutions generated.

Image source: IBM investor relations. 

IBM shares currently yield an impressive 3.2%, far higher than the S&P 500's current 1.9% payout. The company has earned its long-standing reputation for capital return excellence; it has spent $108 billion on share repurchases alone since the turn of the millennium. As such, investors today can get paid to wait as IBM continues to lead the machine-learning revolution.
NVIDIA
Graphics processing unit maker NVIDIA is one of a handful of component makers that produce the hardware that helps support most machine-learning technologies. As the go-to standard for graphics processing chips, NVIDIA possesses a technological leadership in graphic computing that places it in an enviable position for long-term growth. Consider that a research note from Goldman Sachs estimated that NVIDIA's AI opportunity could eventually reach $10 billion. Investors need to understand, though, that capturing this potential will require years and that sales related to machine-learning revenue totaled only $840 million during the company's most recent fiscal year.
As with its revenue growth story, NVIDIA's dividend payments will take years to grow into substantial sources of income. In fact, NVIDIA shares currently yield just 0.6% today. The company only began paying its dividend in 2012, but it has increased its full-year dividends per share every year since then. Moreover, the company's squeaky-clean balance sheet -- to say nothing of its widely expected long-term growth story -- gives the company a stable platform to steadily increase its payouts in the years ahead.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-63215');
            });
        

Microsoft
In line with other major suppliers of cloud computing, Microsoft has moved quickly to integrate machine-learning capabilities into its Azure cloud platform. It remains unclear to what degree customers have used Azure's machine-learning services -- Microsoft didn't detail this figure in its most recent report -- but the momentum behind the company's overall cloud-computing efforts is obvious. Azure revenues more than doubled during Microsoft's most recent fiscal year, and Microsoft expects cloud-computing sales to reach an annualized run rate of $20 billion by the end of its fiscal 2018. (Microsoft's fiscal 2017 ends June 30.)  
Microsoft is one of the more storied income-producing stocks in all of tech. The company began paying its dividend in 2003, and it's increased its payouts for 13 consecutive years. Better still, Microsoft carries roughly $37 billion in net cash, and its ongoing Windows and Office franchises provide it with billions of dollars in cash flows each quarter. That's why Microsoft deserves a spot as one of the more compelling income investments for anyone seeking exposure to the budding machine-learning space. 
",3 Top Dividend Stocks in Machine Learning
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/25/3-stocks-at-52-week-highs-still-worth-buying.aspx,2017-04-25,"
The stock market peaked in March, when both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials reached all-time highs. And while both indices are down a couple percent since, a lot of stocks are still at or near all-time highs -- or at the very least, near the highest they've been in the past year. 
But that doesn't mean there aren't any stocks worth buying -- even some of those at or near their highs. Three stocks in particular look attractive to our contributors: e-commerce specialist Shopify Inc (US) (NYSE:SHOP), casino and resort operator Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), and homebuilder Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN)(NYSE:LEN-B). 

Image source: Getty Images.

Keep reading below to learn what makes these three stocks, all trading at -- or very near -- their 52-week highs, worth buying right now. 
The company that may save small and local retail
Jason Hall (Shopify Inc (US)): Online retail is growing like wildfire. And while the convenience and price competition is undoubtedly good for shoppers, it's decimating the brick-and-mortar retail landscape. 
And it's not just big-box retailers feeling the pinch, since many large companies have the resources to develop an online presence. In fact, smaller sellers are having just as hard a go of it, considering that many lack the resources and expertise to build an online brand and store. 

Image source: Getty Images.

That's where Shopify comes in. The company's core business is helping sellers build and manage e-commerce, and to put it plainly, business is going gangbusters. The company has more than 375,000 individual businesses -- both small and large -- and has seen its revenues nearly triple since going public less than three years ago, while gross profit dollars have increased a remarkable tenfold since 2012. 
And maybe my favorite thing about the company is that its competitive position is very strong. There's a certain ""stickiness"" to its service, because the breadth and depth of what it offers its customers in terms of its e-commerce platform, social media integration, and robust capabilities combine to make it a lot of trouble for clients to move away or replicate the platform in-house. Furthermore, both Facebook and Amazon.com are partnered with Shopify, which is the preferred provider on those two companies' platforms. 
Even with its stock price setting new all-time highs nearly every day recently, Shopify's market capitalization is still less than $8 billion. It's a rare chance to buy a stock with so much growth potential this early in the story. 
Why investors are putting more chips on Wynn
Seth McNew (Wynn Resorts, Limited): Casino operator Wynn Resorts has hit a 52-week high multiple times in recent months as it climbed 35% over the last year. Still, the stock is less than half of its all time high in spring of 2014, which was followed by a dizzying drop in gaming stocks due to government regulations that decimated the Macau market -- one of Wynn's most important markets then (and still). 

Macau skyline at night. Image source: Getty Images.

Things have gotten much better for Wynn as the Macau market has started to turn around since August, which is also the month that Wynn's massive new resort there opened. The resort has already started to perform well, which, coupled with the rising overall market that's expected to continue in 2017, could mean big earnings increases for Wynn going forward. Wynn's operations in the U.S. are stable, if not high growth, but the company has broken ground on a new resort near Boston expected to open in 2019, and it announced a planned overhaul of its Las Vegas resort, both of which seem to be encouraging the market about Wynn's long-term diversified growth. 
Wynn resorts sales jumped nearly 10% in 2016 year over year, but they were up 37% in the fourth quarter, and that momentum seems set to continue this year thanks to Macau's regrowth. Wynn's stock is historically expensive at 49 times earnings following its recent rise, but its earnings are expected to keep growing, which puts its price at 23 times forward earnings estimates.

A reasonable price as long as we don't have another housing crash
Chuck Saletta (Lennar Corporation): Home builder Lennar is trading right around its 52-week high. Despite that optimism, the company's stock still looks reasonably priced unless we're headed for another housing meltdown. Its A class shares trade at barely one times sales and less than 14 times trailing earnings, while its B class shares trade at closer to 11 times earnings due to a wide gap between share class prices.  

Image source: Getty Images.

The B class shares have 10 times the voting rights as the A class shares, though the B class votes as a group. In addition, the B class shares can convert into A class shares if a majority of B class shareholders elect to do so. Despite that potential voting rate advantage, Lennar's B class shares recently fetched a mere $43.08, while its A class shares fetched $51.79.
Complex corporate structure aside, if you're looking at Lennar's shares, the B class shares offer a clearly better bargain between the two. Though the fact that the spread has persisted for so long suggests that there's very little chance it will actually reverse, the lower price of the B class shares gives buyers the opportunity to buy more shares for the same dollar amount.
The key risk with Lennar -- albeit one that may be somewhat reflected in the company's relatively low price to earnings ratio -- is the fact that homebuilding remains a cyclical industry. If the next recession is right around the corner -- and if housing sinks the way it did in the last recession -- Lennar and other homebuilders could easily see their shares sink. After all, people need someplace to live, but it doesn't have to be a new house. 

",3 Stocks at 52-Week Highs Still Worth Buying
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/19/the-2-best-dividend-stocks-in-pc-industry.aspx,2017-04-19,"
In the age of the mobile computing, investing in the PC industry sure isn't what it used to be. As the latest in a litany of examples, the PC market contracted 5.7% year over year in 2016,  according to research firm IDC.
However, for all the doom and gloom surrounding the PC market, the computer industry remains one of the most important subsectors in all of tech. In fact, even as unit volumes contract, over 260 million personal computers were sold last year globally, and the companies that remain at the center of this market -- names such as HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- continue to print tens of billions of dollars in aggregate profits from the space and pass them along to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. So let's review what makes these PC makers some of the best dividend stocks in the industry.
HP Inc.
After spinning off its server business into what today trades as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the current HP Inc. represents one of the few pure-play PC companies to trade on American exchanges and also pay a dividend.
As you might expect, the company's financial performance reflects the broader trends at work in the PC and printer industries, which are fairly ugly at the moment. Revenue declined 9.1% in the company's fiscal 2015 and 6.2% in 2016.  Few believe the PC industry will go away, but potential investors should understand that the growth outlook remains at best moderate for HP Inc. In fact, the majority of sell-side analysts rate its shares a hold and expect HP sales and profits to remain static over the next several years. 
Looking at the company's dividend specs, HP shares currently yield 2.9%, which sits well above the S&P 500's current 1.9% yield.  The company currently pays out 34% of its earnings as dividends, which suggests it could grow its payments in the future. The company's balance sheet isn't overly leveraged, and the bulk of its debt comes due in five years or more. However, even though HP deserves a place on this list because of its prominence within the industry, the following name might prove to be a more attractive option for income investors.

Apple
Though the iPhone remains the profit center that powers Apple's financial performance, the Mac maker remains a force in the PC industry as well. In fact, IDC ranked Apple as the fifth largest PC maker in the world last year, with an estimated 7.1% share of worldwide computer shipments. Apple's shipments and market share declined from 2015 to 2016, though, and it isn't clear which aspects of its PC and notebook business it plans to update this year.
The company already updated its MacBook Pro lineup last year. Having already killed off the 11-inch MacBook Air,  and with the ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook Pro appearing to have erased much of the use case for the 13-inch MacBook Air, it seems unlikely Apple will launch dramatically revamped laptops this year.
The company reportedly has several important changes in the works to its desktop products. Having gone several years without a meaningful update, Apple is in the midst of overhauling the Mac Pro, though the refreshed model isn't expected in calendar year 2017. That leaves the iMac as the lone piece of Apple's PC business due for an update this year.  Expect this update to come at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, if it is indeed in the works.
Regardless of Apple's place in the PC market, the company is a solid dvidend payer and seems likely to continue to be for the foreseeable future. If history is any indication, Apple will raise its dividend as part of its upcoming earnings report on May 2. The company has already returned $201 billion to shareholders since 2012,  and this year's likely iPhone upgrade cycle should further pad Apple's ability to afford further dividends and share repurchases in the coming years.

Whether through cash donations or through providing their products and services free of charge to people and nonprofits in need, corporations across America are making billions of dollars' worth of charitable donations each year. Here's the list of the nation's 12 most charitable companies, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy's mid-2016 report (registration required), along with some of the causes these companies are giving to.

12. ExxonMobil
First up is the oil and gas behemoth ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), which gave more than a quarter of a billion dollars in 2015 alone (the most recent year for which data is available). The company has spread its donation efforts across various areas, from education to global health initiatives to malaria prevention. ExxonMobil also has a program to donate $500 on behalf of an employee for every 20 hours the employee volunteers.

11. Goldman Sachs
Investments banks are driven solely by greed, and they only care about lining executives' pockets -- right? That's the image of big banks that's often played up in the media, but it turns out that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is one of the biggest corporate givers in America. Goldman Sachs Gives, a donor-advised fund, has given more than $1 billion in grants to thousands of nonprofits in 80 countries worldwide.

            });
        

10. Cisco Systems
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is already using its data and cloud computing technology to help develop ""smart cities"" around the world in places like Copenhagen, Denmark. But the company also uses its funding and technology to build ""Community Knowledge Centers"" in areas that lack internet access, such as in Kenya, as shown in the image above. These centers allow local residents to connect to online resources such as skills training. Cisco's management believes investments like these are critical to ending the cycle of poverty in these areas.

9. Wells Fargo
While Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has certainly come under public scrutiny over its problematic account-selling tactics in the last few months, the company has long been regarded as one of the most charitable for-profit organizations in the U.S. Wells Fargo supports hundreds of local nonprofits in the cities where it operates, as well as large national nonprofits that are involved in financial education and much more. Wells Fargo management announced its 2020 economic goals last year, and they include $500 million in philanthropic spending by 2020.

8. Eli Lilly and Company
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is the maker of important pharmaceutical products like Prozac and insulin. It's also the parent of the Eli Lilly Foundation, which awards grants for philanthropic initiatives in the areas of quality healthcare in low- and middle-income countries, as well as public education in the United States, with an emphasis on science and math. The foundation also matches millions of dollars' worth of employee donations each year.

7. Bristol-Myers Squibb
Healthcare company Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) says on its website that it seeks ""to improve the health outcomes of populations disproportionately affected by serious diseases"" through increasing healthcare worker capacity and integrated medical care. The company recently announced a $50 million donation (matched with another $50 million from other donors) in a new public-private partnership with the government of Botswana to treat children with cancer and blood disorders.

6. Microsoft
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates is not only one of the wealthiest people in the world, but also one of the most charitable -- he's the co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has donated tens of billions toward the cause of improving healthcare and relieving poverty around the world. Microsoft seems to hold similar values, as the company notes that it donates nearly $2 million per day in cash and equipment. Its philosophy is that technology can help humankind overcome some of the greatest challenges it faces. In the image above, a Microsoft employee helps farmers in India use technology to better time their crops during a drought.

5. Alphabet
Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) philanthropic efforts include donating its own services -- for example, it gives nonprofits free access to Google Adwords for advertising, and trains military veterans to learn new technologies as they transition to civilian jobs. The company also launches bold technological ventures that are meant to take dramatic steps toward solving the world's problems. For instance, the company provides funding and expertise to groups that can use the Google Earth tool to fight global deforestation.

4. Walmart
Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the world's largest retailer by sales, and it also holds the spot as the largest donor in the retail industry. The company gives cash and product donations to nonprofits working on labor benefits, food for those in need, and much more. The company also sends aid to communities in the U.S. that are affected by natural disasters. In December it gave $250,000 toward relief and recovery efforts in areas of Tennessee that were being ravaged by wildfires.

3. Merck & Company
Merck & Co., a leading healthcare company, donates both cash and medical resources, particularly within the communities where the company operates. It also aids in global initiatives to take on cancer, diabetes, hepatitis C, and HIV/AIDS. The company notes on its website that it donated $1.7 billion worth of products in 2015 alone.

2. Gilead Sciences
The second-largest corporate donor as of 2016 is Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). Gilead is one of the leaders in HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals. Its products include a medication called Truvada, a form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that blocks the virus from spreading between individuals. The company's top philanthropic priority is ending the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and making life-saving healthcare accessible in areas of need. 

Image source: Pfizer. 

1. Pfizer
The most charitable Fortune 500 company in America is Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). This healthcare company, which makes famous drugs like Viagra and Lipitor, seeks to build out healthcare opportunities for those in underserved communities worldwide through ""people, products, and funding."" As part of this goal, the company helps to fund programs that increase awareness of non-communicable diseases and that remove barriers preventing women and children from receiving sufficient care. 
If there's any doubt as to whether it's possible to reward shareholders while leading the nation in charitable giving, consider that the shares of these 12 companies gained an average of 78% over the last five years, compared with 67% for the S&P 500. We look forward to seeing which companies have increased their own corporate giving when the next edition of The Chronicle of Philanthropy's most charitable companies is released.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/20/these-3-stocks-just-raised-their-dividends.aspx,2017-04-20,"
We're still in the wake of calendar 2017's first earnings season. So it wasn't surprising to see a raft of dividend raises last week, especially considering that this year has already been stuffed with lifts from every conceivable type of company.
Here are three notables out of last week's crop.

Image source: Getty Images.

Qualcomm
Following through on an earlier commitment, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has formally declared a new payout of $0.57 per share, an amount nearly 8% higher than its predecessor.
Qualcomm's most recently reported quarterly results show that its business is still robust, despite several tough legal battles and a looming acquisition. The company's revenue continued to rise, increasing by almost 4% on a year-over-year basis to $6.0 billion. Adjusted earnings zoomed ahead by 23%, landing at $1.8 billion. That, by the way, shakes out in a very healthy net margin of 30%.
Income investors might be wary of Qualcomm, as the company loves to spend its money -- at times, its dividend payouts and share buybacks have exceeded free cash flow. Compounding that matter, the company should soon close the door on its acquisition of European peer NXP Semiconductor (NYSE:NXP), a deal with an estimated enterprise value of $47 billion.
I, for one, wouldn't worry. First, Qualcomm committed to its dividend just after signing the NXP Semiconductor deal. Second, those consistently high margins pump out a lot of cash, with operating cash flow in certain years approaching the $9 billion level. The new dividend will cost the company only about one-third that amount.

QCOM Free Cash Flow (Annual) data by YCharts
Qualcomm's upcoming payout is to be dispensed on June 21 to stockholders of record as of May 31. At the most recent closing share price, it would yield 4.3% -- more than double the almost 2% average of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500.
Procter & Gamble
The dividend aristocrats -- the small, vaunted group of stocks that have raised their payouts at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years running -- don't get much more regal than Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). The consumer-goods powerhouse has one of the longest raise streaks on the market, and it just lengthened it by another year. Its 61st consecutive annual lift is a 3% bump to just under $0.69 per share.

PG Dividend data by YCharts
Today's Procter & Gamble is a leaner and more focused company thanks to cost-cutting and a years-long run of asset sales. These have kept profitability afloat despite uninspiring top-line growth. 
Yet the company still has an immense portfolio, so it can compensate for weakness in certain product categories with strength in others. The healthcare segment was the star of the most recently reported quarter, delivering 5% year-over-year net sales growth against the 1% drops of each of Procter & Gamble's other four product categories.
So although free cash flow has dipped lately, to below $10 billion on a trailing-12-month basis, the company should continue to have more than enough dosh to keep that dividend raise streak alive. Plus, it's committed to returning nearly $20 billion to shareholders annually through 2019. I wouldn't worry about the future of this dividend, then. 
Procter & Gamble's new distribution will be paid on May 15 to investors of record as of April 21. It yields a theoretical 3.1%.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-83316');
            });
        

Hospitality Properties Trust 
Specialty real estate investment trust Hospitality Properties Trust (NASDAQ:HPT) is adding a penny to its quarterly payout, lifting it to $0.52 per share. That works out to a 2% raise.
As its name implies, Hospitality Properties Trust specializes in hotels and other traveler lodgings. At the end of last year, it owned or leased over 500 such facilities in the U.S. and Canada.
Business is humming along these days for the REIT. Last month it reported its Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, both of which showed improvements in revenue and profitability. On the top line, the company took in nearly $2.05 billion, 7% higher than the 2015 result. Adjusted funds from operations (FFO) -- the most significant profitability metric for REITs -- jumped by 11% to over $561 million.
What helps is that its properties are squeezing out more profit. Revenue per available room saw a modest, but encouraging, 4% increase over the year.
On a per-share basis, that adjusted FFO result works out to $3.60, which is well above what Hospitality Properties Trust doles out in its dividend -- which, in calendar 2016, annualized to $2.03. The company has been on the market for more than 20 years, and in spite of some dips it's generally managed to improve its FFO over that time. I'd feel pretty safe with this payout.

HPT Funds from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts
Hospitality Properties trust will distribute its next dividend ""on or about May 18,"" to shareholders of record as of April 21. The new payout would yield 6.5% on the REIT's latest closing stock price.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/21/10-reasons-merck-could-be-the-worlds-most-perfect.aspx,2017-04-21,"
The average investor has more than 5,000 publicly traded stocks on reputable U.S. exchanges to choose from. With that much hay in the barn, finding that needle can be quite difficult.
But if you're looking for the world's most perfect stock, perhaps your search might end with pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK). Since Jan. 1970, including splits, shares of Merck have risen by a brisk 4,320%! Though it might appear that its best days are in the rearview mirror after such large gains, there are plenty of reasons to believe it still has ample upside opportunity.
Here are 10 reasons Merck just might be the world's most perfect stock.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. A leading cancer immunotherapy
Without question, the biggest catalyst in Merck's pipeline is cancer immunotherapy Keytruda. Cancer immunotherapies are drugs that suppress cancer's ability to hide within the body, acting as an aid to help the immune system locate and kill these abnormal cells. Sales of Keytruda exploded higher by 151% to $1.4 billion in 2016.
What makes Keytruda such an exciting compound ties into the recent failure of rival cancer immunotherapy Opdivo in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) Opdivo wasn't even close to meeting its primary endpoint in first-line NSCLC as a monotherapy in the CheckMate-026 study, yet Keytruda passed its similar first-line NSCLC trial with flying colors. This opens a new pathway for Keytruda where it'll be able to outshine Bristol-Myers' Opdivo. This is a drug that could wind up selling $10 billion or more annually within the next decade, and it's looking to be the foundation of cancer-fighting therapies for years to come.
2. A long-tail hepatitis C opportunity 
Another area of intrigue for Merck is its hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug Zepatier, which is a once-daily treatment. Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) has absolutely dominated the HCV space with Harvoni, Sovaldi, and Epclusa because of their convenience and efficacy. Merck's Zepatier presents the first real challenge to Harvoni, and it does so with a considerably lower list price than Gilead's therapies. Last year, Zepatier generated $555 million in sales, but its extrapolated Q4 sales have it on target for around $900 million in annual sales. As Merck nibbles at Gilead's market share, Zepatier could turn into a blockbuster drug in 2017.
It's worth noting that Merck's HCV opportunity stretches well beyond the United States. The World Health Organization estimates that 180 million people are infected with HCV worldwide, leading to a long-tail opportunity for Merck.

            });
        

3. Biosimilars 
Merck is also hedging its future by betting big on biosimilars, or biological drug copycats. Though the legal logistics surrounding biosimilar drugs is still a bit hazy, they're expected to go head-to-head with some of the biggest branded drugs in the U.S., and they're being priced at a discount to those branded therapies. In other words, there's a very strong incentive for physicians, insurers, and patients to consider biosimilar medicines because of their attractive price point.
Merck has been focused on five biosimilars: Humira, Remicade, Enbrel, Lantus, and Herceptin. Combined, these drugs sell close to $40 billion a year. If Merck can get even a small piece of that pie, it would be a big deal.
4. Bolt-on acquisitions 
Merck is also a bit of a cash cow. With the exception of 2014, it's generated between $8 billion and $11.1 billion in free cash flow in every year since 2010. This healthy cash flow is what allows Merck to supplement its organic growth with what it likes to call ""bolt-on acquisitions."" Put simply, Merck is looking to complement its core therapeutic indications with mid-cap-sized acquisitions from time to time.
A good example is the company's acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, which was completed a little over two years ago. Cubist was predominantly focused on acute hospital care drugs, which also happens to be one of Merck's primary therapeutic indications. The addition of blockbuster drug Cubicin and other therapies to its product portfolio provided Merck with an instant return on its investment in the form of higher EPS and cash flow.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-83462');
            });
        

5. A premier pharmaceutical pipeline 
As you'd probably expect from a company Merck's size, it has a very healthy pipeline of developing drugs, many of which are in specialty indications. As of Feb. 24, 2017, the latest pipeline update, it had 13 ongoing phase 3 studies and more than a half-dozen phase 2 studies.
Aside from Keytruda, Merck has numerous diabetes combination studies being examined, including its blockbuster drug Januvia. Januvia is beginning to face a lot of pressure from SGLT-2 inhibitors, so if Merck can find a way to incorporate Januvia as a combination therapy for type 2 diabetes it could regain its luster. Add in the aforementioned biosimilars and Merck has a lot going on development-wise.
6. Tight cost controls 
While cost-cutting may not be a long-term strategy, it's been an effective tool that's helped Merck navigate the patent cliff. Between 2010 and Aug. 2015, FiercePharma reports that Merck shed 36,450 jobs. All the while, Merck's sales actually grew even though it cut a significant portion of its staff, showing just how efficient the company has become.
In 2016, Merck saw its research and development costs rise by $490 million, or 7%. However, its materials and production expenses fell by more than $1 billion, and its marketing and administrative costs dipped by more than $550 million. Merck has the ability to pull levers and cut costs, which is a luxury most drugmakers don't have.

                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-75586');
            });
        

7. Strong pricing power 
Investors are also bound to like the significant prescription drug pricing power that a company like Merck brings to the table. The U.S. has a long list of inherent advantages for drugmakers, including its lack of a universal health plan and the fact that Americans demand pharmaceuticals more than any other country in the world. Those exceptionally long patent protection periods don't hurt, either.
There also aren't too many concerns that President Trump will be able to institute pricing curbs on prescription drugs. Congressional Republicans typically favor free market drug pricing, and Trump appears to be far too busy with other aspects of his agenda to concern himself with drug pricing. Translation: Merck can use its pricing power to boost its top and bottom line.
8. Steady growth in animal health 
Thought it's an oft-overlooked building block, the company's animal health division is a steady source of growth. On a constant currency basis, sales of animal health grew by 8% to $3.48 billion in 2016.
The major factor at play is that American families, now more than ever, are welcoming pets into their homes. A Harris Interactive poll from 2012 found that 91% of respondents believed their pet was a part of the family. As a result, the American Pet Products Association found that total pet expenditures in 2016 grew to $66.75 billion, up from $21 billion just two decades earlier. Of that $66.75 billion, $14.7 billion was tied to supplies and over-the-counter care, and another $16 billion to veterinary care. This is a steadily growing business that Merck and investors can count on.

9. Shareholder yield
Big Pharma is known for its healthy margins, and Merck is no exception. Aside from its cash flow giving the company ample flexibility when it comes to making acquisitions, it also provides plenty of capital that can be returned to shareholders. Merck is currently paying out $0.47 each quarter, which over the course of the year translates into a 3% dividend yield. That's well above the average yield of S&P 500 companies.
Merck has also aggressively repurchased its own common stock. Buying back its stock reduces the number of shares outstanding, which can boost EPS, lower the P/E ratio, and make a stock look more attractive on a valuation basis. In March 2015, Merck authorized a $10 billion share repurchasing program. This followed a $5 billion repurchase authorization from May 2013.
10. Valuation
Last but not least, Merck is priced attractively relative to the broader market. The company is valued at a forward P/E of less than 15 compared to the S&P 500, which has a forward P/E that's near 20. All the while, Merck has a healthy pipeline, excellent growth prospects from Keytruda and Zepatier, and ample cash flow to inorganically grow its business.
Merck may very well be the world's most perfect stock.

",10 Reasons Merck Could Be the World's Most Perfect Stock
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/24/better-buy-gilead-sciences-inc-vs-celgene.aspx,2017-04-24,"
Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) and Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) are two of the most successful biopharmaceutical companies to rise out of the 1980s, but since early 2015, Gilead shares have fallen 30%, while Celgene shares have risen 11%. For investors considering them now, the question is, which stock represents the best opportunity for new money?
The case for Gilead
Let's get the biggest issue out on the table right away. Gilead's hepatitis C drugs not only treat the disease, but cure it in as little as six weeks, meaning the population that needs them is shrinking. Not only does that translate into fewer patient starts, but those patients remaining, on average, will be in earlier stages of the disease, and therefore have less urgency about getting started and need a shorter duration of treatment. If that weren't bad enough, competitors showing up to grab a chunk of the shrinking market have had an impact, too. The pain from all of this caused Gilead to guide analysts to a drop of $6.6 billion, or 44%, in HCV sales in 2017, much more than the market had expected.

Image source: Pixabay.

That's equal to a pretty large fraction of Gilead's total 2016 revenues of $30.4 billion -- large enough that management is predicting a 23% decline in revenue this year. But eventually, HCV sales will stabilize as the backlog of very sick patients waiting for treatment is worked through and sales start going primarily to treat newly diagnosed cases. Moreover, the number of newly diagnosed cases of hepatitis C in the U.S. annually has actually been increasing since Gilead's Solvaldi was launched in 2013,, so in time the decline should level off. And Gilead should be able to hang onto significant market share in this area, despite the competition.
Meanwhile, there is a lot to like about the rest of Gilead's portfolio, which provided half of the company's 2016 sales. Its HIV franchise is the top dog in the industry: 63% of diagnosed HIV patients in the U.S. are on Gilead's drugs. Competition is stiff, but Gilead's strong R&D organization has already brought next-generation drugs to market that are growing sales well, and which contributed to its 17% growth in non-HCV anti-virals in 2016. HIV drugs taken prophylactically by at-risk people who have not been infected with the disease will also be a source of growth, and Gilead's Truvada is the only drug approved for that indication.
But the primary bull case for Gilead boils down to two factors: The stock is darn cheap, and the company has plenty of money to buy itself some growth via acquisitions. The decline in the HCV business is well-reflected in the stock price, which is a mere eight times analysts' consensus earnings estimate for 2017, compared with about 18 times forward earnings for the S&P 500. What's more, the company's low cost structure allows it to generate copious quantities of free cash flow -- almost $16 billion of it last year, 52% of revenue. With $32.4 billion in cash and equivalents on hand, investors expect some sort of growth-enhancing acquisition on the horizon, and management has been encouraging that view of late.
The case for Celgene
Celgene is that rare pharmaceutical company that is enjoying rapid growth without the risk of a big drug in decline anytime soon. It hit the ball out of the park in 2016 with a 22% increase in sales and adjusted EPS growth of 26%. Sales growth was 19% in 2014 and 21% in 2015, so last year was no fluke. With growth like that, a valuation of 17 times expected 2017 earnings is quite reasonable.
Part of the good news for investors is that portfolio growth is coming from several sources. Celgene specializes in oncology, hematology, inflammation, and immunology. Its lead drug for various blood cancers, Revlimid, comprises 62% of sales and is still growing strongly, thanks to both gains in market share and increasing durations of treatment. New indications and new combination therapies should continue to power the growth of Revlimid, with analysts expecting sales to increase from $8 billion last year to $13 billion in 2022.  But two other treatments -- Pomalyst/Imnovid for multiple myeloma and Otezla for psoriasis -- reached also blockbuster status during 2016.
The other good news is that the company's pipeline should sustain growth for a long time. Its next blockbuster will probably be ozanimod, for relapsing multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis; that drug could have peak annual sales in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion. And over the next two years, the company will get data readouts from 19 phase 3 trials and advance nine novel molecules to pivotal trials.
In fact, of the 30 molecules in development and the 50 programs supporting them, 14 could launch in the next five years, 10 of which have blockbuster potential. Optimism about the pipeline led a spokesperson to share the opinion that the company predicts revenue growth every year out to 2030.

The better buy
So which is the better investment at this time, the stock that is cheap for good reason or the one that is more expensive for good reason? I'm going to pick the strongest business: Celgene.
Although Gilead is a cash-generation machine, and has an unquestionably strong balance sheet, that $32 billion in cash doesn't look quite as impressive when one takes into consideration its $26 billion in debt -- up from $6.6 billion just three years ago. Cash growth last year was financed by an increase in debt and a reduction in working capital, while almost all free cash flow was returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
While there is certainly enough financial strength there to do an acquisition -- if not as big a purchase as some hope for -- what we don't know is how well any acquired assets will pay off in the long term. I expect that in the short term, an acquisition by Gilead would boost the stock, potentially by a lot, as earnings jump and the multiple improves. But over a period of say, five or 10 years, we can't know if Gilead 2.0 would be able to put up the same level of growth that its peers have, let alone what Celgene is already accomplishing.
In the end, I prefer the compounding effect of Celgene's more-certain growth for many years, without the risk inherent in an unknown, future acquisition that makes the Gilead thesis work. Even with its higher price tag, I think Celgene is the better bet.

Dividend stocks are the foundation upon which great retirement portfolios are often built. Including dividend reinvestment, investors have enjoyed an average return of approximately 7% per year by staying invested in high-quality, dividend-paying stocks over the long run.
Dividends offer a number of key advantages for investors. The most obvious is that they can help hedge against inevitable stock market corrections. However, dividends also act as a beacon to attract investors to high-quality companies. A company would more than likely not issue a quarterly dividend and share a percentage of its profits with investors if it didn't believe those profits were sustainable, or could grow, over the long-term. Lastly, dividends can be reinvested back into more shares of dividend stock, thus leading to a process known as compounding where you wind up with successively more shares of stock and bigger dividend payouts in a repeating cycle.

Unfortunately, it takes more than a dart throw to snag a great dividend stock. Some dividend stocks are like wolves in sheep's clothing, and could wind up suckering unsuspecting income investors into potentially bad investments. Remember, yield is a function of stock price, meaning that a company with a struggling or failing business model and a declining stock price can have a growing yield that could, on the surface, look attractive.
With this in mind, here are three high-yield dividend stocks that you'd be best off avoiding this spring.
Frontier Communications 
If it looks too good to be true, it usually is! That's the lesson to be learned from telecom and content services provider Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR), which is currently sporting a 21.6% dividend yield. If this payout were to somehow hold, investors would be able to double their money, including dividend reinvestment, in less than four years. But the chance of this dividend holding without a cut seems increasingly small, which is why this high-yield dividend stock is to be avoided this spring.
Frontier's problems essentially boil down to the multiple instances where it purchased landline assets from Verizon. Frontier had a decent plan on paper when it acquired these landline assets: landline margins were high, and the company anticipated that it would be able to convert a number of these landline customers into broadband consumers through bundled deals. Unfortunately, that's not how things have worked out.
To begin with, wireless access has expanded nationally to include more rural communities that were previously not covered. This has reduced the need for consumers to have landlines in their household. Frontier has seen a steady bleed to its landline customers since it made its initial Verizon wireline asset acquisition back in 2010. Between Q3 2016 and Q4 2016, Frontier lost more than 100,000 wireline customers, and its average monthly revenue per residential user fell by $2.01.

Likewise, the rise of streaming content platforms has made the need to bundle in order to save money somewhat obsolete. Broadband subscribers fell by 91,000 to 4.27 million in Q4 2016 from the sequential third quarter. In other words, Frontier's business model is slowly dying.
While its cash flow may appear sufficient to cover its lucrative dividend, the tipping point may come sooner than even Wall Street has forecast. This is a high-yield dividend stock worth avoiding.
Barnes & Noble
Another high-yield dividend stock to consider avoiding at all costs this spring is the nation's largest brick-and-mortar bookseller, Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS). Currently paying $0.15 per quarter, Barnes & Noble is yielding a healthy 6.6%, or more than three times the average yield of the S&P 500.
However, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barnes & Noble is in serious trouble, as are many physical retailers. The rise of e-commerce is stinging brick-and-mortar retailers hard, and companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) are eating them for breakfast!
A quick look at Wall Street's longer-term sales projections tells us everything we need to know. After generating $4.2 billion in sales last year, marking its fourth consecutive year of declining sales, Wall Street has projected another four consecutive years of sales declines coming up. By 2020, Barnes & Noble is estimated to only be generating $3.5 billion in annual sales. In the company's third-quarter report, it called for a disappointing 7% slide in same-store sales this year.

Considering that Amazon doesn't need to have a physical store presence (even though it recently announced that it'll open a handful of physical bookstores), it operates with substantially lower overhead costs than brick-and-mortar stores like Barnes & Noble. It also has cash flow coming in from so many different channels (cloud and marketplace) that it can operate with lower margins than Barnes & Noble. The only response from Barnes & Noble has been to cut costs in an effort to maintain its margins, but closing underperforming stores isn't exactly a long-term strategy. It's akin to putting a Band-Aid on a large wound.
Like Frontier, Barnes & Noble has the cash flow at the moment to continue paying a healthy dividend, but its payout ratio is well over 100%, and its business is slowly decaying. With no true catalysts, this remains a high-yield dividend stock you'll want to steer clear of.

            });
        

Nordic American Tankers
Finally, income seekers would be wise to ignore what looks like a delectable 14% trailing dividend yield, and 9.8% forward yield, on Nordic American Tankers (NYSE:NAT). At its forward yield of nearly 10%, investors could double their money in a little more than seven years on the payout alone. But that's if it holds -- and I strongly believe it won't.
Nordic American Tankers operated a fleet of 30 Suezmax crude oil tankers as of the beginning of the year, though an expansion was announced in February that'll increase its fleet to 33 Suezmax vessels. The company firmly believes that expansion of its fleet is imperative to its long-term growth prospects.

Image source: Getty Images.

But therein lies the issue: Nordic American Tankers is entirely reliant on Suezmax vessels. While most shipping companies offer a variety of shipping vessels and commodity targets, Nordic American Tanker has but a single ship type, the Suezmax, leaving it exceptionally vulnerable if oil prices dip or daily charter rates drop.
Additionally, Nordic American Tankers has gone to the opposite end of the spectrum of most of its peers and focused on relatively nimble short-term contracts. Though this gives the company added flexibility if spot shipping rates rise, it also leaves the company particularly exposed to the spot market for shipping rates and even crude oil pricing.
This year, Wall Street is projecting that Nordic American Tankers will generate $0.94 in cash flow per share, but its forward yield predicts $0.80 per share in aggregate payouts. This doesn't seem doable with new vessels being added to the fleet, crude prices stalled, and Nordic American carrying more than $440 million in debt.
If you're looking for a high-yield stock primed for a dividend cut this spring, Nordic American Tankers just might be your stock.

",3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Avoid This Spring

In nearly every sense, semiconductor makers NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) are opposites.
NVIDIA's graphic processing chips (GPUs) enjoy leadership positions in some of tech's most important growth markets, a fact that has fueled the 650% rally in its shares over the past five years. But after losing big to the market over this same time frame, Cypress Semiconductor stock has shown surprising signs of life lately, outperforming NVIDIA and the Nasdaq Composite so far in 2017.

CY data by YCharts
Given these mixed signals, it's understandable to wonder which semiconductor stock looks like the better buy today. Let's look at NVIDIA and Cypress Semiconductor with a three-part analysis to see which seems like the better stock to own right now.
Financial fortitude
In our first category, NVIDIA demonstrates a clear edge over Cypress in terms of its balance-sheet strength. Here's a quick breakdown of four of the most commonly used financial metrics for liquidity and solvency for the two.


CompanyCash and InvestmentsDebtCash From OperationsCurrent Ratio



NVIDIA
$6.7 billion
$2.7 billion
$1.6 billion
4.7


Cypress Semiconductor
$120 million
$1.2 billion
$217 million
1.2



Data sources: NVIDIA and Cypress Semiconductor investor relations; Yahoo! Finance. 
Here, NVIDIA bests Cypress across all three measures of financial fortitude; I prefer to combine cash and investments with debt to create a single net-cash metric. NVIDIA carries more net cash, generates more than 7 times the cash from operations as Cypress, and enjoys a far more favorable mix between current assets to liability. It's the clear winner here.
That said, Cypress' debt burden really jumps out. The company has used leverage to fuel acquisitions in recent years, particularly the $550 million in debt it assumed to purchase Broadcom's Internet of Things business last year, an acquisition that helps diversify its revenue stream into a growing section of the semiconductor market. The majority of its debt comes due in 2020 or later, so the company has plenty of time to reap the benefits of its acquisitions before it must repay its financing. Either way, NVIDIA enjoys the more stable financial footing, making it the winner in our first category.
Winner: NVIDIA.

Durable competitive advantages
In terms of their business ""moats,"" NVIDIA edges out Cypress for a few important reasons.
As Cypress' operations go, the company splits its revenue almost evenly between its memory-chip division and its microcontroller and connectivity divisions. Making memory chips currently drives the bulk of the company's financial performance. Though Cypress lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year, its memory business generated $192 million in operating profit from $928 million in sales. But as we've seen with other memory-chip makers such as Micron Technology, the commoditized nature of most memory products makes it difficult to consistently generate profit on an annual basis.
Worse yet, there isn't much to love with Cypress' microcontroller and connectivity business, either. Though some of its acquisitions should eventually produce results, the segment has lost money in each of the past three years, even as segment sales have almost tripled. 
NVIDIA, on the other hand, enjoys dominant and highly lucrative positions in each of its core markets. As just one example, the company's GPU business, which produced 82% of its $6.9 billion in sales last year, generated an impressive $2.1 billion in operating profit. 
Better still, it enjoys significant growth opportunities. Just to list a few estimates, various trustworthy sources estimate that self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and PC gaming represent a combined long-term addressable opportunity of over $62 billion for NVIDIA. And so, as with the analysis of financial strength, NVIDIA wins this assessment of durable competitive advantages with ease.
Winner: NVIDIA.

Valuation
Last but not least, let's compare the two companies' valuation. Here's a snapshot of three of the most commonly used valuation metrics for NVIDIA and Cypress Semiconductor.

NVIDIA trades at a fairly steep premium to the S&P 500's earnings valuation of 26, but as we saw, the GPU specialist's long-term earnings growth opportunity deserves a premium. The question any investor needs to answer is how NVIDIA's valuation premium relates to its likely long-term trajectory. We have a few clues to help us find an answer.
The average of sell-side analysts currently projects NVIDIA to grow its revenue 16% this year and another 12% next year. Over the next five years, they estimate it will compound its EPS at an 11% average annual rate. Though certainly above average, low- to mid-single-digit growth alone probably isn't a rapid enough expansion to justify NVIDIA's current P/E. However, I think this also brings up an important point when it comes to investing in the GPU specialist.
Most of the upcoming growth from major trends such as self-driving cars will still be coming to market in 2022, the outward limit of analysts' current estimates. So it seems likely that the company's growth could ramp up considerably over the next 10 and 20 years as many of the big-ticket trends associated with its investment thesis migrate from concept to commercial product, something current estimates and multiples simply cannot capture with any degree of precision.
As for Cypress Semiconductors' valuation, the company seems closer to fairly priced. Cypress should switch to profitability in the year ahead, a much-needed sign of progress from a company that's demonstrated a lack of results over the past few years. Analysts see revenue rising 11% this year and 5% next year, while sales are expected to compound at a 58% average yearly rate over the coming five years; remember, though, that the company's current losses mean EPS will be starting and growing from zero. However, it doesn't seem as if a clear mispricing exists in Cypress' shares, either.
Winner: Tie.
And the winner is... NVIDIA
You may have sensed this coming. With its numerous, sizable growth levers, the company looks like a strong contender to outperform the market averages over the long term. Cypress is clearly headed for surer footing after a grinding restructuring. However, between the two, NVIDIA still stands as the better stock to own today for long-term investors.

Financial stocks led all indexes in popularity, as some of the biggest banks reported quarterly earnings. The sector trailed the broader market by a wide margin, though, resulting in a 1.3% drop for the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF). Meanwhile, an increase in gold prices wasn't enough to keep the highly leveraged Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:JNUG) from falling 10.4%.
As for individual stocks, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Pier 1 Imports (NYSE:PIR) declined as investors digested their latest quarterly earnings reports.

Wells Fargo targets trust
Wells Fargo shares fell more than 3% in the wake of the banking giant's fiscal first-quarter results. The company earned $5.5 billion in the period, which translates to $1.00 per share, up from $0.99 per share in the year-ago period. Revenue ticked down to $22 billion from $22.2 billion a year ago. The sales figure came in just below consensus estimates, while profits were above expectations.

Yet the results demonstrate that Wells Fargo still has its work cut out for it in terms of winning back its customers' trust following an account scandal that severely damaged the brand. Customer satisfaction and loyalty levels are lower than they were a year ago, but the company was encouraged to report that both figures ticked up during each month of the quarter. ""Wells Fargo continued to make meaningful progress in the first quarter in rebuilding trust with customers and other important stakeholders, while producing solid financial results,"" CEO Tim Sloan said in a press release.
A few key financial wins included higher average deposits and improvements in both return on assets and return on equity when compared to the prior quarter. Those successes were offset by struggles elsewhere in the business, including a drop in the balance of average loans thanks to a slowdown in new credit accounts and a drop in auto loans.

Pier 1 Imports improves profitability
Shares of home furnishings specialist Pier 1 Imports slumped 9% after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings results. The numbers showed flat sales over the key holiday period, but that was no big surprise to investors, as the retailer pre-announced many of its quarterly metrics in early March.
A few of the newly announced details showed solid operating trends, though. Pier 1 managed a 28% spike in e-commerce sales and, by relying much less on promotions and price cuts, succeeded in pushing gross profit margin higher by nearly 3 percentage points to 39.2% of sales.
As a result, the company hit the high end of its recently boosted profit guidance by earning $0.33 per share. ""We are pleased to conclude the year with strong fourth quarter results,"" interim CEO Terry London said in a press release. ""[W]e strengthened our top-line trend, highlighted by positive company comparable sales, improved merchandise margins, controlled operational costs and increased profitability,"" he added.
Still, management issued a forecast for the coming year that left some investors wanting more. The official projection calls for sales growth to be between 1% and 2% as merchandise margin stops at 58% of sales. Both figures would represent improvements over the prior year's result, given that Pier 1 logged a 1% comps decrease in fiscal 2017 as merchandise margin weighed in at 57.3%.

Nine years ago, Warren Buffett made a bet with a hedge fund manager that's about to come due. Buffett bet that a collection of hedge funds would not be able to beat the 10-year return on the S&P 500. He's now on the verge of winning that bet.
With only a single year left on the wager and the large-cap index up over the best-performing fund by more than 20 percentage points, there seems to be little chance that Buffett will not prevail. Listen in on this week's episode of Industry Focus: Financials to hear what Gaby Lapera and John Maxfield think this means for individual investors.
A full transcript follows the video.



This podcast was recorded on March 6, 2017.
Gaby Lapera: I don't know if you remember this, but back in 2008, Warren Buffett made this bet with some hedge fund managers, saying that he bet them the S&P 500 would outperform the hedge funds over a 10-year period. And whoever won, so, whoever's moneymaking device went up in a greater percentage over the course of the 10 years, would pay $1 million to a charity of their choice. And we are nearing the end of that. There's only one year left in that competition.

            });
        


John Maxfield: Yeah, we have one year. To recap, Buffett has basically said, ""Nine years ago, I bet a hedge fund manager that a selection of hedge funds that they choose can't beat the S&P 500."" So now, fast-forward to today, one hedge fund manager took him up on that offer, selected five hedge-fund funds of funds, that's a hedge fund that invests in other hedge funds, so that gives you even greater diversity, which would presumably give you a better chance to beat the S&P 500. The best of the five funds that this manager selected is up 62.8% since the bet was made. The S&P 500 is up by 85.4%. And that was the best group, by far. The other ones are like 2.9%, 7.5%, 8.7%, and 28.3%.
Lapera: That's so rough.
Maxfield: Yeah. And it just goes to show, and he talked extensively about this in the letter, maybe these investors -- the rate structure for hedge funds, they pay a ton of money for these things -- maybe there isn't as much value there as people think.
Lapera: Yeah, and this is a big thing that Warren Buffett is about, and The Motley Fool, to some extent, too. If you don't have time to closely monitor your investments, consider investing in the S&P 500. It will probably get you a better rate of return over time for much cheaper than a hedge fund, without the potential pitfalls of owning individual stocks. But yeah, I bet those hedge fund managers are kept up at night by this bet.

            });
        


Maxfield: Yeah, but you know what I love about this? Buffett is basically telling people, ""Look, complicated investing isn't necessarily the best investing."" The Motley Fool, we're a company that speaks to individual investors that don't have all the money and sophistication to pour into developing models and doing all of these things. And what this shows is, you don't need that to compete in the markets in a competitive way. It's just a reassuring thing for investors, and it's something that I think investors should really listen to, and take that advice.

Dividend stocks are the foundation upon which great retirement portfolios are often built. Including dividend reinvestment, investors have enjoyed an average return of approximately 7% per year by staying invested in high-quality, dividend-paying stocks over the long run.
Dividends offer a number of key advantages for investors. The most obvious is that they can help hedge against inevitable stock market corrections. However, dividends also act as a beacon to attract investors to high-quality companies. A company would more than likely not issue a quarterly dividend and share a percentage of its profits with investors if it didn't believe those profits were sustainable, or could grow, over the long-term. Lastly, dividends can be reinvested back into more shares of dividend stock, thus leading to a process known as compounding where you wind up with successively more shares of stock and bigger dividend payouts in a repeating cycle.

http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/13/ask-a-fool-are-my-dividends-safe.aspx,2017-04-13,"
Q: I own several dividend growth stocks. How can I tell whether the dividends will keep growing, or if a dividend cut is possible?
First of all, there is no 100% guaranteed way to determine if your dividends are safe. There's always a risk that any company will need to cut its dividend in the future. Having said that, there are a few things to look at that can help you determine if your stocks have a strong probability of growing their dividends.
The first metric you should know as a dividend investor is known as the payout ratio. This is simply the dividends a stock pays out divided by its earnings. For example, a stock that paid out $1.00 per share last year and earned $2.00 would have a payout ratio of 50%. Lower payout ratios mean that the stock earns a lot more than it pays out, so even if earnings were to drop a little, the dividend should be sustainable.
I generally like to see payout ratios under 50% from dividend stocks (excluding REITS, which are required to pay out 90% of their earnings). It's a big warning sign if any of your stocks have payout ratios close to or greater than 100%. 
Next, take a look at your stock's earnings history. You don't necessarily need to see growth every single year, just stability and an upward trend over time. The safest dividends come from businesses that do fine no matter what the market is doing. 
Finally, look at the company's dividend record. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, but stocks that raise their dividends year after year tend to continue to do so.

Let's use Johnson & Johnson as an example. The company pays an annualized dividend of $3.20 and earned $6.73 in 2016, for a payout ratio of 48%. The company has also grown its earnings at a very consistent pace, and has increased its dividend, without fail, for 54 years straight. Therefore, I'd say there's an extremely low chance Johnson & Johnson will have to cut its dividend anytime soon.

Given these mixed signals, it's understandable to wonder which semiconductor stock looks like the better buy today. Let's look at NVIDIA and Cypress Semiconductor with a three-part analysis to see which seems like the better stock to own right now.
Financial fortitude
In our first category, NVIDIA demonstrates a clear edge over Cypress in terms of its balance-sheet strength. Here's a quick breakdown of four of the most commonly used financial metrics for liquidity and solvency for the two.

Here, NVIDIA bests Cypress across all three measures of financial fortitude; I prefer to combine cash and investments with debt to create a single net-cash metric. NVIDIA carries more net cash, generates more than 7 times the cash from operations as Cypress, and enjoys a far more favorable mix between current assets to liability. It's the clear winner here.
That said, Cypress' debt burden really jumps out. The company has used leverage to fuel acquisitions in recent years, particularly the $550 million in debt it assumed to purchase Broadcom's Internet of Things business last year, an acquisition that helps diversify its revenue stream into a growing section of the semiconductor market. The majority of its debt comes due in 2020 or later, so the company has plenty of time to reap the benefits of its acquisitions before it must repay its financing. Either way, NVIDIA enjoys the more stable financial footing, making it the winner in our first category.
Winner: NVIDIA.

Durable competitive advantages
In terms of their business ""moats,"" NVIDIA edges out Cypress for a few important reasons.
As Cypress' operations go, the company splits its revenue almost evenly between its memory-chip division and its microcontroller and connectivity divisions. Making memory chips currently drives the bulk of the company's financial performance. Though Cypress lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year, its memory business generated $192 million in operating profit from $928 million in sales. But as we've seen with other memory-chip makers such as Micron Technology, the commoditized nature of most memory products makes it difficult to consistently generate profit on an annual basis.
Worse yet, there isn't much to love with Cypress' microcontroller and connectivity business, either. Though some of its acquisitions should eventually produce results, the segment has lost money in each of the past three years, even as segment sales have almost tripled. 
NVIDIA, on the other hand, enjoys dominant and highly lucrative positions in each of its core markets. As just one example, the company's GPU business, which produced 82% of its $6.9 billion in sales last year, generated an impressive $2.1 billion in operating profit. 
Better still, it enjoys significant growth opportunities. Just to list a few estimates, various trustworthy sources estimate that self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and PC gaming represent a combined long-term addressable opportunity of over $62 billion for NVIDIA. And so, as with the analysis of financial strength, NVIDIA wins this assessment of durable competitive advantages with ease.
Winner: NVIDIA.

Valuation
Last but not least, let's compare the two companies' valuation. Here's a snapshot of three of the most commonly used valuation metrics for NVIDIA and Cypress Semiconductor.

NVIDIA trades at a fairly steep premium to the S&P 500's earnings valuation of 26, but as we saw, the GPU specialist's long-term earnings growth opportunity deserves a premium. The question any investor needs to answer is how NVIDIA's valuation premium relates to its likely long-term trajectory. We have a few clues to help us find an answer.
The average of sell-side analysts currently projects NVIDIA to grow its revenue 16% this year and another 12% next year. Over the next five years, they estimate it will compound its EPS at an 11% average annual rate. Though certainly above average, low- to mid-single-digit growth alone probably isn't a rapid enough expansion to justify NVIDIA's current P/E. However, I think this also brings up an important point when it comes to investing in the GPU specialist.
Most of the upcoming growth from major trends such as self-driving cars will still be coming to market in 2022, the outward limit of analysts' current estimates. So it seems likely that the company's growth could ramp up considerably over the next 10 and 20 years as many of the big-ticket trends associated with its investment thesis migrate from concept to commercial product, something current estimates and multiples simply cannot capture with any degree of precision.
As for Cypress Semiconductors' valuation, the company seems closer to fairly priced. Cypress should switch to profitability in the year ahead, a much-needed sign of progress from a company that's demonstrated a lack of results over the past few years. Analysts see revenue rising 11% this year and 5% next year, while sales are expected to compound at a 58% average yearly rate over the coming five years; remember, though, that the company's current losses mean EPS will be starting and growing from zero. However, it doesn't seem as if a clear mispricing exists in Cypress' shares, either.
Winner: Tie.
And the winner is... NVIDIA
You may have sensed this coming. With its numerous, sizable growth levers, the company looks like a strong contender to outperform the market averages over the long term. Cypress is clearly headed for surer footing after a grinding restructuring. However, between the two, NVIDIA still stands as the better stock to own today for long-term investors.

The financial sector was one of the worst performers, sending the popular Financial Sector SPDR Select ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) lower by 0.4% to trail the broader market. Gold prices rose a touch, but not by enough to give a lift to Direxion Daily Jr Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:JNUG), a leveraged bet on the precious metal. Instead, the fund fell 1.5%.
As for individual stocks, PriceSmart (NASDAQ:PSMT) and Ryerson (NYSE:RYI) attracted heavy investor interest in the wake of their  quarterly earnings reports.

PriceSmart's Trinidad struggles
PriceSmart shares fell 6% after the international warehouse retailer posted its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. The announcement included plenty of good news for investors, led by the fact that sales growth is rebounding sharply in the Colombian market. A stable local currency helped that segment jump 38%, with double-digit increases in average spending and transaction volume.  The growth contributed to a 2.1% boost in overall comparable-store sales. PriceSmart also posted 5% higher membership income as its renewal rate rose to 83% from 80%.
The retailer can't seem to shake economic business risks, though. Trinidad, its largest market in the Caribbean, is suffering from what management described as ""difficult economic conditions with a corresponding impact on consumer spending ."" This slowdown was compounded by increasing financial risk around a potential devaluation of the local currency, which management responded to by limiting merchandise shipments into the country. As a result, sales in Trinidad declined 9.6% -- the main factor behind PriceSmart's 5% drop in the Caribbean region.
The retailer's fiscal third quarter is off to a solid start, management said, with comps up 2.9% in March compared to February's 2.6% gain. Still, the company seems destined to struggle with economic and financial challenges in another key market just as its Colombian division is showing signs of a sustainable rebound.

            });
        

Ryerson's growth turnaround
Metals specialist Ryerson jumped 10% after announcing guidance for its fiscal first quarter. The company expects higher revenue, executives said, both sequentially and year over year. That would mark an encouraging turnaround from the 10% sales decline that Ryerson endured in its fiscal 2016.
Several positive trends are contributing to the turnaround, including higher volumes and rising average selling prices for aluminum, stainless steel, and chrome. Ryerson executives are also seeing demand growth in nearly all sectors, according to the press release. Some of its strongest gains came from the oil and gas, construction equipment, and food processing equipment industries.
The strengthening sales trends promise to generate significantly higher earnings, too. Ryerson forecast adjusted profit in the range of $53 million and $55 million, compared to the $37 million it booked a year earlier and the $36 million it generated in the final quarter of 2016.
The company is set to release its detailed first-quarter results on May 4, and investors will be looking for specifics in that report that point to broad improvement in global metal demand. They'll also be hoping for evidence that Ryerson is continuing to steal market share, reduce costs and lower its debt burden.

Financial stocks underperformed the broader market as the popular Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) declined 0.8%. On the other hand, an uptick in gold prices produced solid gains for the second straight day for Direxion Daily Jr Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:JNUG), which rose 4%.
As for individual stocks, both Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) attracted heavy investor interest following their quarterly earnings reports.

Delta's improving outlook
Delta shares dipped 0.5% after the company posted quarterly results that included disappointing sales and profit growth -- but also a few tantalizing hints of a rebound ahead. Revenue per available seat mile fell 0.5%, missing management's guidance that called for an increase of 1% at the midpoint. Rising costs, especially on fuel, contributed to a sharp drop in profitability as operating income dove 32%.

Image source: Getty Images.

Yet the company believes that profitability will show solid improvements over the next three quarters of the year. It sees revenue speeding up and is encouraged by the fact that March was the first month of positive passenger unit revenue since November 2015.
Fuel costs aren't likely to pinch profits through the rest of 2017, either. ""With an improving revenue profile and further improvement as our cost growth moderates in the second half, we are on track to expand margins for the balance of the year,"" Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said.
Delta's guidance calls for operating margin to grow to between 17% and 19% in the fiscal second quarter as revenue per available seat mile rises 1% to 3%.

Fastenal's profitability dip
Shares of industrial supply specialist Fastenal lost 8% after the company announced fiscal first-quarter earnings results. Revenue improved 6.2% to reach $1.05 billion and earnings rose at the exact same pace to $0.46 per share. The actual sales figure was a hair higher than consensus estimates while Wall Street analysts were right on the mark with their EPS projections.
Fastenal executives said they were encouraged by a pickup in the industry following a relatively weak 2016 fiscal year. ""We are pleased with the improving pace of business growth,"" CEO Dan Florness said. ""This is a welcome sign of improving business activity and of the traction we are gaining in our growth drivers,"" he added.
One drawback of the success in these growth initiatives is that they tend to carry lower margins than the core business. That was a key factor behind a 40-basis-point decline in gross profit margin, to 49.4% of sales. But Fastenal managed to offset most of this drop through discipline around administrative and operational expenses. As a result, bottom-line earnings rose at a slightly faster pace than revenue, to $134 million.
Looking forward, investors can expect Fastenal to slowly shrink its store footprint as it continues to adjust to the weak industry conditions that marked last year's results. At the same time, it aims to aggressively invest in growth initiatives like its network of industrial vending machine sites, which could keep pressure on its profit margin.

A full transcript follows the video.



This episode was recorded on April 11, 2017
Alison Southwick: This is Motley Fool Answers. I'm Alison Southwick and I'm joined, as always, by Robert Brokamp, personal finance expert here at the Motley Fool. In this week's episode we're joined by a Fool who is going to share the path he took to achieving an impressive 814 credit score. We're also going to answer your question about how much to invest in each sector and play a rousing game of ""Can I Throw It Away Already?"" All that and more on this week's episode of Motley Fool Answers.

It's time for Answers, Answers and today's question comes from Christian on Twitter. His handle is @ChristianMPT. He writes, ""Any suggestions or resources for what percentages to invest into each industry sector? I feel overweighted in tech.""
Robert Brokamp: Well, Christian, let me start by parsing out the terms. Actually, sector and industry are different. Sector is sort of the big umbrella term, and most people consider the sectors that have been identified by the Global Industry Classification Standard. It's a joint project of Morgan Stanley and S&P, and there are 11 sectors.
Underneath those sectors is where you get industries and sub-industries. There's actually 24 industry groups and 157 sub-industries.
Southwick: Wow! OK.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-45308');
            });
        


Brokamp: So I'm going to assume you're talking sectors -- the big 11. You're not unique in probably being overweighted in tech. First of all, if you're a Motley Fool reader or listener, you probably already have a lot of tech because we like tech stuff. But it's also the sector that has the biggest weighting in the S&P 500 -- 22% of the S&P 500 is in tech.
However, just because you have many stocks in the same sector doesn't necessarily mean you're overly concentrated, and I'm going to cite an excellent article that came from a guy named Adam McCullough from Morningstar. He looked at the top 10 holdings in the major sector ETFs and found that some are more concentrated than others in terms of their correlation.
When you look at, for example, the real estate sector ETF, all top 10 holdings are correlated, because they're all sensitive to interest rates. If interest rates go up or down, they all move. However, when you look at something like consumer discretionary, even though all these stocks might be considered consumer stocks, they're very different. For example, the No. 1 holding in consumer discretionary is Amazon.
Southwick: Right.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-30793');
            });
        


Brokamp: Then Home Depot. Then Comcast. Then Walt Disney.
Southwick: Because Amazon ... well, that could also be a tech stock.
Brokamp: Exactly.
Southwick: Yeah.
Brokamp: Exactly. So just because you have a lot in tech doesn't necessarily mean that you're overly concentrated. You have to look at the individual companies and see if they're in similar businesses. Do they often perform similarly?
But if you're looking for a general rule of thumb, I would say that once you get up to about 30% in one sector, you might be pushing it. You might want to cut back a little bit. And I say that particularly with 2008 in mind, which was the worst year for the stock market since the Great Depression.
A lot of people were very focused in financial stocks, particularly people who were retired, because they were looking for the dividends that came from those stocks. But that was the industry that got hit the hardest. So probably once you hit 30%, it's time to start thinking about maybe diversifying a little bit more.
__
Southwick: I believe it was Aristotle who once said, ""Show me the credit score and I will show you the man."" Or maybe no one said that, but someone could have. Your credit score is a number between 300 and 850, and it's based on your history of debt, managing your credit and paying bills. It's a very important number, and Nathan Hamilton, an analyst here at the Motley Fool, joins us today to talk about how he was able to achieve a credit score of, da da da duh, 814.
Brokamp: 814!
Nathan Hamilton: 814.
Southwick: I think you can do better, though.
Hamilton: I could. I could get up to 850.
Brokamp: That's true.
Southwick: Yeah, you could. So thank you for joining us, Nathan ...
Hamilton: Absolutely. Glad to be here.
Southwick: ... and sharing your story. So first off, talk to us a little bit about why a credit score matters so much.
Hamilton: I guess, simply put, it's the most important number in our financial lives that most of us don't know about. Not being grandiose, there, but research shows that 60% of Americans don't know their credit score. That's the majority of people out there.
Southwick: So out of the three of us, do you know your credit score?
Brokamp: I do.
Southwick: I don't.
Brokamp: I mean, I don't know the exact number, but it's in your neighborhood.
Hamilton: OK.
Southwick: I'm sure I'm in your neighborhood, too.
Brokamp: I would be surprised if you're not.
Hamilton: Well, after this episode let's go check it ...
Southwick: Go check it. All right, let's.
Hamilton: ... and you can take a look. [Why is it important?] Say with a mortgage. A poor credit score versus an excellent credit score has a 1.5 percentage point difference. That sounds like a small number, but if you look at 30 years with a 30-year mortgage, that's tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars that you could save just by having a better credit score, budgeting well, and saving.
Brokamp: There are all kinds of people who have some sort of influence on your financial life that will be looking at it. Insurers. Potential employers can be looking at your credit record. There are studies that show that people with lower credit scores do get into more car accidents, for example. If I had to know just one thing about someone, and make a prediction about what their financial life is going to look like, I'd choose their credit score because it shows whether they're a person responsible with money.
Southwick: Now you, however, maybe didn't get off with the best start with money.
Hamilton: I did not.
Southwick: But before we get to how you got to 814, tell us about where you started.
Hamilton: I guess my story is probably similar to a lot of people. I got my first credit card. I wasn't too informed.
Southwick: Did you get it in college because of the free t-shirt?
Hamilton: It may have been.
Southwick: A frisbee or something like that.
Hamilton: I think I wanted to buy a new computer and get something that I wanted but didn't need, essentially. So after opening my first credit card, it was pretty much a few months before I was incurring interest charges. Had racked up debt -- I think several thousand dollars within that time frame and just pretty much went on a spending spree.
Southwick: Ooh!
Hamilton: Yeah. It was very nice, but I don't remember what I bought or anything.
Southwick: Aw!
Hamilton: But I do remember the feeling I had of being in debt at that point. And I made a decision to never take on credit card debt again, just because of the high interest charges. To never pay those interest charges.
So to get out of debt, what I did is essentially opened up a balance transfer credit card. For people that may not be familiar with it, it's just essentially taking your balance from one card and moving it to another card where there's a 0% introductory APR for a certain number of months (12, 15, 18, 21 months). I did that twice. So I opened one card, didn't incur interest. Kept on paying the balances down on time. I wasn't able to pay it off during the promo period. Opened another balance transfer card. Closed down the old one and kept on doing that until the debt balances were paid down.
Southwick: The idea of opening up new credit ... we've been doing this show long enough for me to know that it's actually not bad, but it sounds bad. Like to be saying you opened up a credit card to pay off another credit card sounds like a bad idea, but it's not.
Hamilton: But it's not. No, because if you look at my credit [history], [I think] I've held, over my entire life as a borrower, 19 credit cards.
Southwick: Wow!
Hamilton: And some of them I will sign up for bonuses and I'll use the card infrequently. Some are just ones that I use as my standby go-to. I normally carry just one to two cards in my wallet to keep it simple. But over time I have used credit cards for various different purposes.
And there will be a slight ding [in your credit score] when you apply for new credit -- five to 10 points depending upon the scenario. But if you look over the long term, if you're opening another account, and establishing a payment history of paying on time, and you're managing your debt well, that's more data that credit score models can use to assess your risk as a borrower.
Southwick: And talk a little bit about credit utilization and how that impacts your FICO score.
Hamilton: So as part of paying down the balance transfers, credit utilization is looking at how much debt you borrow versus what you have available on your revolving credit limit. And with your FICO score, you want to bring that number down. By paying off debt quicker, you're impacting 30% of your FICO score by doing so.
So that's one thing. When you look at the balance transfer cards, why does it make sense to do that? You're establishing a payment history, which counts for 35% of your score. You're bringing down your credit utilization ratio, which impacts 30% of your score. Those are the two single biggest factors driving your FICO score and where many people should focus for improving it.
Southwick: So should I also call up my credit card [company] and try to always max out my credit limit, or does that backfire?
Hamilton: In certain scenarios.
Southwick: Oh, OK.
Hamilton: So if you're prone to spending that credit limit increase, absolutely don't do it.
Southwick: I'm not. I'm not prone. I'm not prone to spending too much.
Hamilton: But if you manage your finances well and you want to improve your credit utilization ratio, absolutely. Dial up your credit card company. Go online. It's simple to request a credit card limit increase, and I don't see any reason to not do so if you're good at managing your finances and not taking on that additional debt.
Brokamp: One thing you mentioned is that the most important thing is just paying your bills on time.
Hamilton: It is. It's simple.
Brokamp: And how have you managed to do that to make sure? You have an actual system that you follow.
Hamilton: Yes, and I've started this one in the last year or two. If you look at credit cards, they're super convenient. It's easy to get into debt. They say on average that people spend about 18% more with a credit card versus, say, a debit card. So in my brain I had to say, ""How do I budget better?""
What I've done is I've broken down my budget into 10-day increments, so the 10th of the month, the 20th of the month, and the end of the month, and I've set up an allotted amount that I spend within that time frame. I pay the balance off. Go to the next 10 days. Pay the balance off and set alerts on your account. When your balance goes above a certain threshold, you're notified and it says, ""Okay. You're not meeting your budgeting goals.""
Brokamp: Gotcha.
Southwick: So you have some recommendations that you want to leave our listeners with if they want to improve their credit score. What's the first piece of advice you have?
Hamilton: The first one is if you are in debt (just like I was when I was 21 and spending whatever amount of money on whatever purchases I still can't recall), just pay down that debt quick, because bringing down your utilization ratio, like I said, is going to impact 30% of your score.
The second thing you can do is never miss a payment, and that comes down to budgeting and spending within your means.
Southwick: And then as far as specific credit cards, what do you suggest?
Hamilton: In the case where you do have debt, balance transfer credit cards are going to make sense. And there's so many on the market. If you look at it, there's over 1,700 credit cards in the U.S.
Southwick: Wow!
Hamilton: And for people looking for balance transfer cards, they definitely need to narrow down the options out there. If you go to fool.com/creditcards, we do have our picks of the best balance transfer credit cards. If you don't have debt, maybe it makes sense to look at earning rewards, because you're paying your balance off monthly. You're not incurring interest charges. You might as well earn, say, 1.5% to 2% cash back or travel rewards for those everyday necessity type purchases.
Southwick: So in addition to, obviously, paying your bills on time and credit utilization, what else should people keep an eye on when it comes to keeping a credit score looking high and awesome?
Hamilton: Getting above 800.
Southwick: Yeah, getting above 800.
Hamilton: As we mentioned before, credit inquiries are going to have an impact, but they do roll off after 12 months, so they roll off of your FICO score. They are reported on your credit report ...
Southwick: That's just if you open up new credit? Or if you get a mortgage?
Hamilton: Yes, open a new account. If you apply for a mortgage. There are certain instances, like applying for a new cellphone or ...
Southwick: Rent?
Hamilton: Yes, rent. Anything like that where there is a hard inquiry you want to keep track of, but as I mentioned, they roll off after 12 months.
Southwick: Okay.
Hamilton: The other part of it is having a good mix of credit accounts. So be it a student loan, be it a mortgage or credit cards (whatever type of money you can borrow), the FICO-scoring models will take a look [at whether you] have a good mix of accounts, assess it, and say, ""Okay, you're a good borrower. We're going to give you a higher score.""
Southwick: Is there anything wrong with opening all these said credit card accounts and then just leaving them dormant and just snipping them?
Hamilton: If you're incurring an annual fee for not using the card, it makes sense to close it down. But if they are no-annual-fee credit cards, there's no harm in keeping them open. What it does is it establishes your average account age. To get the best score out there, you really want to have an average account age of five years. And keeping your cards open in those scenarios will definitely make sense.
Southwick: Another thing we often tell people is if they want to improve their credit score, to check in on their credit reports and make sure there's nothing inaccurate. Do you want to talk about that a little bit?
Hamilton: If you go to what I believe is FreeCreditReport.com or My Annual Free Credit Report ... you can look on Google and there are websites where you can get your free credit report. Now the important thing to remember is that's your credit report. It's not your actual credit score.
Southwick: Right. It's what your score is based on. So that information in your credit report is what FICO crunches. It's the data FICO crunches to give you your credit score.
Brokamp: It's actually AnnualCreditReport.com. More and more services, I found, are actually offering your credit score for free.
Southwick: Oh yeah, Credit Karma.
Brokamp: And Bankrate. That said, some of those are not the actual FICO. It's basically their educated guess ...
Hamilton: Their guess ...
Brokamp: At what your credit score actually is.
Hamilton: Yeah. It's directionally right when you look at those free credit scores -- all of those offers you see out there -- but it's not a FICO score. But you can get a free FICO score, and what I recommend is some credit cards offer it. Some banks offer it. And there may be a good chance that if you are with some of the major banks out there, check with them. You already have access to a free FICO score through your existing relationships.

Southwick: So we're all embracing spring. Throwing open the windows and hopefully tossing things out. Maybe not necessarily out the window but whatever. So Bro and I are going to play a rousing game of ""Can I Throw It Away Already?"" to help you with your spring cleaning. The first one -- old tax returns.
Brokamp: Here's the guidance from the IRS, and I think it's actually quite funny. First of all, keep stuff for three years unless situations four, five, or six apply to you. What's situation four? Keep them for six years if you underreported your income, and it's more than 25% of what you should have. Keep it forever if you've committed fraud.
Southwick: Is that right?
Brokamp: So if you've committed fraud, just keep those records around. Generally speaking, I would say three years is what the IRS tells you, because that's the amount of years they have to audit you. But I think seven years is a better guideline just as a good rule of thumb.
Southwick: Bills, bills, bills, bills. I've got my phone bill. I've got all these bills, such as stubs.
Brokamp: I would say the average utility type of bill, keep it for a year, and that's about as long as you need it.
Southwick: Photos of me that aren't flattering. This is going to be from the '90s.
Brokamp: These don't exist.
Southwick: That's very sweet. They do exist. For now, anyway. All right. Receipts from household purchase items. Are you talking about blenders?
Brokamp: No, I'm talking about ...
Southwick: Refrigerators?
Brokamp: Anything that if your house were to burn down, you would want proof that you owned it. So big appliances. Refrigerators. Oh, also anything that would be under warranty. That said, if your house burns down, you're going to lose some of those receipts, so some of the important stuff ...
Southwick: Yeah, that's going to go.
Brokamp: I actually recommend you take pictures of all that stuff so you have digital copies, and the really important stuff keep in some kind of fireproof safe, which is what we have at our house.
Southwick: Pay stubs?
Brokamp: Pay stubs generally for a year. That last pay stub is the most important, because that tells you everything you need to know in terms of what you've been paid. How much in taxes you paid, but also how much you contributed to retirement accounts. You may remember in a previous episode a fellow was contributing to both his traditional 401(k) and his Roth 401(k), but this 401(k) provider didn't separate the two contributions. We suggested he go back to his pay stubs. So if you're doing anything funky with your retirement accounts -- actually anything related to retirement accounts -- it's actually better to keep some information, at least on an annual basis forever.
Southwick: Your childhood diary?
Brokamp: If you hadn't gone through puberty yet, it's adorable. If you've gone through puberty, it's embarrassing.
Southwick: It's so bad! It's the worst!
Brokamp: My 25-year-old daughter has posted some stuff she wrote when she was like 12 on Facebook, and it's really cute. But I could just imagine. I found my diary, once, [from] high school, and it was just embarrassing.
Southwick: It's just all feelings, right? Isn't it?
Brokamp: It's all feelings.
Rick Engdahl: Just don't keep one. Don't ever keep one. It's not worth it.
Brokamp: It's like if my kids ever found it, oh!
Southwick: Yeah. I found mine the other day, and I was like, ""Oh, I'll just pull a random date and read it."" I literally wanted to go back in time and punch myself in the face. It was so bad! It was just bad!
Engdahl: I think we have a new fun segment on our hands.
Brokamp: Girls, just bring your diaries in. Today's entry -- Duran Duran has a new song out.
Southwick: He's dreamy. All right. The pile of paperwork you signed when you bought your house.
Brokamp: You want to keep it for as long as you own the house, because it will have information about what you paid and stuff like that. That will be information you need when you sell it to calculate any kind of gain. If you owe any taxes on it. Generally most people don't, but you want to keep that around.
Once you've moved from the house into another house, keep that information for about seven years and then get rid of it.
Southwick: Account statements, like the ones from my broker and 401(k) and all that stuff.
Brokamp: Anything that establishes the cost basis of anything you've bought, that you eventually will sell and have to report on your tax return, keep it. If it's your IRAs, generally speaking you don't have to worry about it unless you're making non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA. Keep that information. But anything for a taxable brokerage account, keep that information because at some point you're going to sell those investments, and you're going to need some way to calculate your cost basis.
Southwick: Receipts for home improvements.
Brokamp: Keep those, because those also will factor into the cost basis of the house when you eventually sell it.
Southwick: You actually would consider that? Like you would look at that and think about it?
Brokamp: Yeah, because for most people you have a home sale exclusion of $250,000 per person and $500,000 per couple. That means you can gain that much on your house and not worry about taxes. But who knows about future tax law, and living in Washington, D.C., if you've owned your house for a long time, it's possible. So all that stuff would be factored into the cost basis of calculating your gain.
It's also for any appraisal, so if you're going to get a home equity loan or a reverse mortgage (anything where they're going to appraise your house), you want to say, ""Actually my house is worth this much more than you think it is, because we improved the kitchen, or we did this or that.""
Southwick: So home improvements over what amount of money? Thousands? A couple of thousands?
Brokamp: For me, we just have this big file of everything we've done to the house. So it pretty much just gets thrown in there. But if you've painted the mailbox, it's probably not necessary.
Southwick: Well, casa Southwick is going to get a whole lot cleaner, here. Thank you very much. I'm going to go throw some stuff away, and maybe even my diary.
Engdahl: I have a question.
Southwick: Yes?
Engdahl: Is there any reason any of this cannot be electronically stored instead of paper stored? Can I just take a picture of everything?
Brokamp: Sure.
Engdahl: Or does some of it have to be, for legal reasons, actually in paper?
Brokamp: Not that I know of. Even with the IRS, now, they are strongly encouraging people to do everything digitally so I think it's possible. As long as you have two places to store that information. So you have it in a computer and then maybe a backup drive.
Engdahl: Even tax returns? Stuff like that?
Brokamp: I think it's fine. I mean, I've been filing my taxes electronically now, for years. I have printed them out just because I'm that type of guy, but the IRS ...
Southwick: Sentimental.
Brokamp: ... does not say anything about making sure you have a print copy.
Engdahl: I've always printed them out because I thought I was supposed to be that kind of guy. But I'm not, and I'd be happy to not print them out, if that's legal.
Southwick: We're giving you permission to not be that guy.
Engdahl: Whoo!

",How to Get an Excellent Credit Score -- and Why You Definitely Want One
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/19/3-signs-target-inc-needs-new-management.aspx,2017-04-19,"
Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) seems to have gone from one catastrophe to the next in recent years.
A 2013 data breach affected more than 70 million customers and dampened sales over the subsequent quarters. That was followed by the company's decision to end its ill-fated expansion in Canada in 2015, which resulted in a massive $5.4 billion writedown. More recently, the company's decision to allow transgender customers to use the restroom of their choice prompted a boycott among some of its customers.

Sales and profits have also fallen in recent quarters, and the stock has gotten punished.

TGT data by YCharts
While the broad market trades near all-time highs, Target is down more than a third from its 52-week high, and the stock has been one of the worst performers on the S&P 500 over the last year.
CEO Brian Cornell took the helm of the big-box chain in August 2014, so he was not responsible for the credit card breach in 2013 or the Canadian expansion, though he did make the decision to pull out of Canada. Still, the stock has fallen about 10% during his tenure, and the company's recent performance has left much to be desired. Beyond the backlash over the company's bathroom policy and the stock's slide, there are other signs that Target may be due for a management change. Here are a few.
1. Executives heading for the exits
In recent months, Target has lost its Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Digital Officer, and the head of its grocery division. Over the last two years, the company has also seen the Chief Legal Officer, Chief Merchant, Chief Human Resources Officer, and Chief Stores Officer positions change hands.
Only two of the company's 11-member executive team remains from when Cornell became CEO. While rotation among executives can simply signal a company shifting strategy, it's often representative of greater problems, such as disagreements over strategic direction, poor performance, an unpleasant work environment, or even poor compensation.
Many of the recent defections correspond with problem areas for Target. Online sales have lagged behind those of peers and growth has slowed, which likely explains the departure of Chief Digital Officer Jason Goldberger, and the company's grocery strategy has long been muddled as well, leading to excess spoilage. Not surprisingly, grocery chief Anne Dament, who was one of Cornell's first big hires, left the company last November after just 18 months in the position.
2. Declining comparable sales
Comparable sales, which strip out the  effects of new stores, are one of the best measurements of a retailer's performance. However, comparable sales at Target have fallen for three straight quarters after seven consecutive quarters of growth. In the key fourth quarter, store-based comparable sales dropped 3.3%, though overall comparable sales were only down 1.5% due to a 34% increase in digital sales.
Management's guidance for the current year was also underwhelming. It sees low-single digit decline in comparable sales for 2017 and low-to-mid single digit decline in comparable sales for the first quarter. While the retail sector has struggled with the loss of customer traffic as e-commerce becomes more popular, Target's rivals like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) have managed to deliver consistent comparable sales growth. Wal-Mart has overcome challenges to deliver nine straight quarters of comp sales growth, and the popularity of Costco's membership model has proven to be enduring.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-35064');
            });
        

3. A questionable turnaround strategy
Cornell came on to replace former CEO Gregg Steinhafel, whose tenure ended after the data breach disaster. At first, the stock responded favorably to Cornell's strategy, but the recent decline in sales and profits has pushed the stock into the red. 
Cornell responded to the challenge by introducing a new strategy and financial model at the most recent earnings call. The strategy includes lowering prices to make the store more competitive with Wal-Mart and other peers, a move that will cut into profits. Cornell has said the company needs to do more to fulfill the second half of its slogan, ""Expect More. Pay Less.""
At the same time, however, the company plans to refurbish 600 stores and open 100 smaller stores by 2019. In many ways, the strategy mimics Wal-Mart's decision in 2015 to invest in lower prices, higher wages, and cleaner stores, which cost it on the bottom line but has boosted sales. Target doesn't have the same economies of scale or other advantages that Wal-Mart has, though.
At the Shoptalk retail industry conference a few weeks ago, Cornell's presentation stood out for being focused on brick-and-mortar retail rather than new technologies. The company's plans to open new stores runs counter to the trend in much of the retail industry, which is either closing stores or scaling back on new locations. 
Cornell's future with Target may be riding on the outcome of his turnaround strategy. With less than three years at the helm, the board is likely willing to give him some more time to return the company to growth, but if cutting prices and sprucing up stores fails to bring customers in the door, it could be time for the board to show him the door as well.

",3 Signs Target Corporation Needs New Management
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/23/forget-mother-of-all-bombs-3-defense-stocks-to-own.aspx,2017-04-23,"
First came the Tomahawks -- 59 of them, launched at a military airfield in Syria. Then came the bombing of an ISIS cave fortress in Afghanistan. With every passing week, it seems, Americans get another introduction to the weapons that make up the arsenal of democracy. (Next week, it could be aircraft carriers in Korea...)
Of course, this week the talk is all about the Air Force's GBU-43/B ""MOAB."" Officially designated the Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb, MOAB has been more popularly christened the ""Mother of All Bombs"" -- which works just as well for the acronym.

MOAB on the move. Image source: U.S. Air Force.

At 30 feet long and 40 inches in diameter, MOAB is the largest nonnuclear bomb in the U.S. arsenal. It weighs 21,715 pounds -- 18,739 pounds of which is warhead -- more than 10 full tons. It's so big that conventional bomber aircraft can't even carry it.
Instead, MOAB must be loaded into the hold of a C-130 transport, then pushed out the back door for delivery. Exploding in the air above its target, MOAB unleashes a blast equivalent to 11 tons of TNT going off at once, incinerating everything within one mile of ground zero.
But here's perhaps the most surprising thing about MOAB, for investors: No one company seems to make it.
Whence came MOAB?
Designed by the Pentagon's Air Force Research Lab, MOAB is put together at the government-owned-and-operated McAlester Army Ammunition Plant in Oklahoma. You might think the Pentagon would have contracted a professional munitions maker such as General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) to put MOAB together. Instead, the Air Force built MOAB itself. Why?
It could be that the Air Force never asked; it could be that defense contractors simply weren't interested. You see, as big as an individual MOAB may be, the MOAB program itself was vanishingly small. Only 15 MOABs were ever produced, and two of those were used for testing. The MOAB dropped in Afghanistan was the third -- which leaves just a dozen MOABs in the Pentagon's arsenal (as far as we know).
In any case, to date, it seems that not a single contract to build additional MOABs has been awarded to any private defense contractor, ever. So, while MOAB may be dominating headlines right now, it's not a program likely to help any defense stock's bottom line.
Three defense contractors you can count on
If headlines can't be relied upon to reveal promising investments, what is a better way to invest? Personally, I use common sense.
Let's start with the Constitution. The U.S. Navy is the only branch of the military specifically authorized by the Constitution (Article I, Sec. 8) to be maintained as a standing force. It's also, I think, the one branch of the military most likely to receive steady funding in all international environments -- both in times of war and in times of peace.
Why? Simply because of its mission. America needs a full-strength Navy in both war- and peacetime to ensure freedom of navigation, to protect commerce from pirates (yes, pirates still do exist), and to ""show the flag"" to prevent conflicts between other nations from happening. These missions ensure a steady flow of funding to the Navy to build new ships and keep the fleet operational and in good repair. They also, I feel, insulate the Navy somewhat from defense spending cuts in times of international tranquility.
To my mind, this makes the three biggest naval contractors -- General Dynamics, Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII), and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) -- three of the most reliable defense contractors to invest in. General Dynamics builds submarines and destroyers for the Navy. Huntington Ingalls' specialty is aircraft carriers and amphibious assault vessels -- although it builds submarines and destroyers as well. Lockheed Martin builds aircraft, of course, including the Navy's new F-35C stealth fighter jet and the Marine Corps' F-35B. But Lockheed also has contracts to build Littoral Combat Ships for the Navy.
Speaking of shipbuilding contracts, in contrast to other weapons systems that can be built in a day, or several days, it takes several years to build a complete warship from the keel up. Your average Virginia-class nuclear submarine, for example, can take General Dynamics or Huntington Ingalls two years to complete. The nuclear-powered supercarriers that Huntington builds take even longer -- about five years each.
These long timelines mean that when a naval defense contractor wins a contract, investors can map out future revenues, and estimate future profits, several years into the future -- which lends a bit of certainty to an investment. It's one thing I like about investing in the naval contractors.

            });
        

Caution: Caveats ahead
What don't I like? Honestly, I find the stocks of the shipbuilders, like most defense contractors these days, unattractively valued at present. While not the most egregiously priced stocks in the defense industry, General Dynamics, Huntington Ingalls, and Lockheed Martin currently sell for valuations far above the ""one times sales"" valuation that I use as my rule of thumb for fair value in a defense stock.
However, this is only a temporary obstacle to investing in the defense industry, where valuations tend to move in cycles. (For an illustration of what the industry looks like when defense is out of favor, check out the articles I was writing seven years ago -- when defense stocks were consistently underperforming the S&P 500.) Although they're expensive today, there will come a day when defense stocks are undervalued again.
And now you know which stocks to invest in once that day arrives.

Index funds can be some of the most cost-effective ways for investors to get broad exposure to everything from the general market to a small subset of international stocks that can be difficult for the average investor to buy. And depending on your investment goals, there's probably an index for you. 
We asked five of our contributors to highlight their top index fund to buy this month, and Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:VEIEX), Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEMKT:VWO), iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEMKT:IWM), Schwab US Broad Market ETF (NYSEMKT:SCHB), and Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (NYSEMKT:BND) were at the top of the list.

Making small-cap stocks easy to own
John Rosevear (Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF): The case for small-cap stocks probably needs no introduction, but just in case: Small companies can provide outsized growth, albeit with volatility that is typically higher than that of the overall market. I'd argue that most long-term portfolios will benefit from some indexed small-cap exposure.
Charles Schwab's U.S. Small-Cap ETF is relatively new, but it's no slouch. It tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Small Cap Total Stock Market Index, which gives it a little bit of a bias toward larger (but still small) stocks versus funds that track the more commonly used Russell 2000 Index, such as the widely owned iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEMKT:IWM).

Small cap

61.88%


Micro cap
18.58%
30.31%



Data source: Morningstar.
That bias toward companies with somewhat larger market caps makes for somewhat smoother sailing than other small-cap index funds. The fund's recent performance has benefited from the strength of mid-cap companies as a group, though that could shift over time. Nearly all of the fund's holdings (over 98%) are in U.S. stocks. 
With a net expense ratio of just 0.05% of assets and a low portfolio turnover ratio of 11%, the fund is inexpensive to own. It's a nice low-cost way to add some well-diversified small-cap exposure to your portfolio.
It's always a good time to dollar-cost average into a low-cost broad index ETF
Chuck Saletta (Schwab US Broad Market ETF): The Schwab US Broad Market ETF (NYSEMKT:SCHB) holds the distinction of being the lowest-cost broad-based index ETF I could find. With an expense ratio of a mere 0.03% and a low 5% turnover rate, it's a low-cost, low churn way to get exposure to a broad swath of the US stock market.
The Schwab US Broad Market ETF aims to track the Dow Jones Broad US Stock Market Index, which contains 2,500 of the nation's largest companies by market capitalization. If, like most people, you don't have the time or inclination to research and build a portfolio of individual stocks, dollar-cost averaging into a low-cost stock-based index fund is a great way to build your retirement account.
If you're following that dollar-cost averaging strategy, then you'll want to put money into your investment account every payday and buy your stake in the fund. That's true whether you believe the market is currently overvalued, fairly valued, or has room to run. In a dollar-cost averaging strategy, you'll buy more shares when the market is cheap but fewer when it's expensive -- but over time, you should wind up with a rate of return near the overall index you're tracking.
As a result, you shouldn't expect to outperform the overall market with the Schwab US Broad Market ETF, but it still has the potential to be a great wealth building tool over time.

            });
        

A low-cost way to invest abroad
Brian Feroldi (Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund): With the S&P 500 regularly hitting new highs, there is an argument to be made that investors need to look elsewhere for value. Thankfully, the last few years haven't been kind to investors in emerging markets, which makes right now a good time to considering looking abroad. If that sounds like a winning idea then I'd suggest you consider buying the Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund. 
This fund offers investors instant access to more than 4,300 businesses that operate in high-growth countries such as India, Taiwan, China, Brazil, and Russia. By holding a position in so many businesses, this fund stays extremely well diversified so that shareholders do not have to be overly concerned when any given business or country goes through hard times. I also like that the median market capitalization across all of the fund's holdings is $12.8 billion, which means that it is not overly concentrated in small-cap businesses. Income investors will also like that the fund offers up a dividend yield of 2.13%. And despite offering all of these benefits, the fund's expense ratio is only 0.32%, which is dirt cheap. 
The only downside to this index fund is that Vanguard requires you to invest at least $3,000 upfront to get in. If you don't have that much money to invest but you are still interested, considering buying the ETF version of the fund known as the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEMKT:VWO). While you might have to pay a commission to buy shares, you will gain all of the benefits of this fund, and you will pay a lower expense ratio of only 0.14%. For high net worth individuals, there is also an admiral version of the fund that offers a lower expense ratio if you can handle the $10,000 minimum investment requirement.
Get the portfolio income you want
Dan Caplinger (Vanguard Dividend Appreciation): Dividend stocks have been extremely popular lately, as many investors want a combination of portfolio income and share-price appreciation potential from their investments. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF offers investors a great vehicle for getting exposure to dividend stocks, with an emphasis that makes the dividend ETF slightly different from most of its peers.
The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF doesn't just focus on stocks that have the highest yields. Instead, it looks for companies that have put together an impressive track record of growing their dividend payouts steadily over time. Many of the stocks that the Vanguard dividend ETF owns have been boosting their dividends year in and year out for decades, and that gives long-term investors a steadily rising amount of dividend income that they can use to match the impact of inflation on their expenses and corresponding cash needs.
Moreover, Vanguard Dividend Appreciation's price can't be beat. With an expense ratio of just 0.09%, you'll pay next to nothing for the simple dividend stock exposure that the ETF provides. If you're looking for a low-cost way to get the dividend income you need, Vanguard Dividend Appreciation can provide a good long-term solution.

                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-14224');
            });
        

The stock full of bonds
Travis Hoium (Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF): My four Foolish colleagues above have focused on some great index funds that follow a variety of segments of the stock market. But index funds can give investors exposure to bonds as well, without the hassle of trying to buy corporate or government bonds directly. The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF is not only a great way to get exposure to the broad world of bonds, it's also an extremely low fee fund, with an expense ratio of just 0.06%. 
The goal of the fund is to give exposure to a broad range of U.S. investment grade bonds and match their returns long-term. From a performance standpoint, that means the value of the ETF will fluctuate based on the ups and downs of bond values, rising when rates go down and falling when rates go down. But the payoff is a yield that currently stands at 2.42%, paid by the coupon received from bonds the fund owns. 
Long-term, the ETF has been much less volatile than the broader stock market, which is a feature of owning investment grade bonds. And with a solid dividend payment this is a great way for investors to get some bond exposure. This won't be an investment that crushes the market, but if stocks go through a rough spell this is a lower risk investment that should preserve capital better than most stock funds. 

",5 Index Funds to Buy in April
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/24/united-continental-investors-expect-turbulence-aft.aspx,2017-04-24,"

In this segment from Market Foolery, Chris Hill welcomes Motley Fool analysts Jim Mueller and David Kretzmann to the show to cover United Continental Holdings (NYSE:UAL) and its latest quarterly results.
But what they -- and probably any investor in the airline industry -- really want to know is whether all the outrage over the appalling treatment of a passenger will ultimately affect the company's business.



A full transcript follows the video.







This video was recorded on April 18, 2017.

Chris Hill: Let's move on to United Continental Holdings. First-quarter profits came in higher than expected, and I don't know about you guys, but I almost don't care about this quarter. I know that technically, this quarter for United included the incident with the doctor getting dragged off the plane. But I am already looking forward to three months from now, to see...isn't that really the big question that's on the mind of certainly anyone who focuses on the business media, and anyone who is investing? I think this is one of the most interesting questions that's going to play out in the short term right now. How tangible is this outrage? There was plenty of outrage online over the doctor being dragged off the plane and coming back on the plane and being bloody and all that. Does that translate into a meaningful decline in United Continental's business?
Jim Mueller: You're both looking at me. [laughs] 
Hill: I'm looking at both of you. And I don't know, I look at this and think, part of me -- and I don't own shares of this or any other airline, but we talked a little bit about this earlier, David, part of me is rooting for them to get a little bit of pain here.
David Kretzmann: Yeah, they need to feel some sting, some pain after that.
Hill: Yeah. But it also would not surprise me, given the way the airline industry runs as a whole, it would not surprise me if, three months from now, we were talking about, ""Yep, it was another good quarter for United Continental.""
Mueller: I don't think it's going to matter one bit, to tell you the truth. I was doing some reading before coming in the studio. There was an episode of Freakonomics from last June called ""Why Does Everyone Hate Flying?"" The answer is probably because it has become like mass transit. The cost of a flight, all in, including everything -- inflation, baggage fees, buying a meal, everything -- is half of what it was 30 years ago. The safety record of airlines is tremendously good. The last two accidents with major U.S. airlines, the last one was the Asiana flight coming into San Francisco -- three people died, and one of them was killed on the ground after being hit by an emergency vehicle. So only two passengers died from the crash. Before that, it was 2001, some 12 years earlier, when there were 265 people killed on the American Airlines flight out of JFK. Now, for a while, people were thinking it was shot down, that one. In that 12-year span, 442,600 people were killed on U.S. roads. Mass transit is what airlines are. When you get that, you get low fares, which is very important for a lot of people, but you also get a lot of inconvenience and, occasionally, you get beaten up. [laughs] 
Kretzmann: [laughs] That's what we learned a couple weeks ago.
Hill: And along those lines, a big part of the story with United was the whole really shining a light on airlines overbooking. But once the statistic started to come to light, you find out that yes, technically, this still goes on. It goes on a lot less than it used to.
Mueller: That's true.
Hill: So I don't know. Again, I feel like nothing would shock me three months from now in terms of results, in part because one X-factor at play here is the United States Congress, which, it would not surprise me at all if they decided, ""You know what's going to make us look good?"" Because few things have as low of an approval rating in America as the United States Congress. ""What's going to make us look good is hauling Oscar Munoz, the CEO of United Continental, in front of us at a hearing and beating him up for a while.""
Mueller: That's probably going to happen. But what I think would be better for the industry, and for passengers, too, is if competitors started coming out with ways to mitigate a lot of this bad press that everybody is getting. It's not just United. United is in the crosshairs right now, but they all do this, and the carriage of contracts, which is what the ticket is, allows them to do almost anything they want to. But if they're smart, they're going to say, to differentiate themselves, ""We don't do this.""
Kretzmann: We don't beat you up. [laughs] 
Mueller: I've heard the food is coming back to one of them, [Delta Air Lines], maybe, coming back to the economy class, and you don't have to buy. Your ticket is going to go up a little. But a lot of people grumble about having to buy the box of three-week-old bread or whatever.
Hill: I mentioned this to each of you individually this morning. We've seen businesses in other industries do very well with loyalty programs. We see it, certainly, with food and beverage. Why don't airlines go bigger into the loyalty programs? When I'm on a flight and they make the obligatory announcements about, ""If you want our frequent-flyer card, we'll give you 10,000 miles."" Why don't they just right out of the gate astonish everyone with ""We're going to give you a 100,000 miles,"" just to get you into that program? To go back to Netflix for a second, one of the mistakes I think investors make about Netflix is in thinking that video streaming is a zero-sum game. It's not like buying a car. When you go out to buy a car, one automaker is going to win your business, and all the others are going to lose. When it comes to video streaming, yeah, you're going to have an Amazon Prime account, you're going to have a Hulu account, you're going to have a Netflix account. In terms of the airlines, I feel like if one of them gets smart and figures out a way to lock people into some sort of loyalty program that rewards customers, they're going to be a big winner.
Kretzmann: I think you're describing Southwest, at least more than any of the other major airlines in the U.S. And Southwest has been an incredible performer not just in airlines, but across the S&P 500. It's one of the best-performing, if not the best-performing, over the last 30 years since it went public in the late '70s. Southwest has locked down that loyalty program. I have a Southwest card. I prefer to fly Southwest if they have a route between the cities I'm flying to. And I think that's an important point, because for me, I lose track of United, Delta, American. It's like, I know I booked with them, I'm probably going to get delayed, I'll probably get some warm orange juice on the flight, it's not going to be a pleasant experience, but it will get me where I need to be, probably just a little bit later than I would like.
And I actually had a friend who came up to me last week and said, ""Did you see that video of what happened on the Delta flight?"" I was like, ""Do you mean the United flight?"" I don't think there's a whole lot of brand differentiation at the end of the day with some of those airlines. But I think Southwest has done a good job with that loyalty program. One of the perks of that is, Southwest doesn't make their flights available on third-party platforms like Expedia or Priceline. People have to go to Southwest's site, and it reinforces the brand that way. When you have a positive experience, I think you get a loyal customer base.
Mueller: And I think therein lies the answer to your question, Chris, is commoditization. Those airline miles that can be transferred across airlines, you can get them from almost any credit card you want. They're so cheap, and they are no longer worth what they used to be worth.

",United Continental Investors Expect Turbulence After Earnings Beat
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/19/netflix-is-becoming-a-boring-stock.aspx,2017-04-19,"
Something remarkable happened after Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported earnings this week: The stock barely moved. 
In the usually volatile after-hours session, the stock initially fell a couple of points as subscriber growth came in slightly below guidance, but then it moved modestly into the black on the earnings call.
On Tuesday, the first full day of trading, the stock closed down 2.6%, nearly erasing the previous day's gain.
For years, Netflix has been the most volatile stock on the S&P 500, with its post-earnings swings averaging in the double digits, but this week's report marked the second in a row to receive only a muted response from the market as its January report prompted just a 3.9% bump in the stock. By contrast, the average swing in Netflix's four reports last year was more than 11%.

Image source: Netflix.

There's a good reason for that shift, and Netflix management is pushing it in that direction. In Monday's earnings report, management made an important change to the results table at the top of its letter to shareholders. For the first time, Netflix shined the spotlight on conventional financial figures like operating income and earnings per share rather than just focusing on subscriber growth. 



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-74818');
            });
        


The company explained the move, saying in the letter, ""Starting this year, we can be primarily measured by revenue growth and (global) operating margins as our primary metrics,"" as opposed to subscriber growth and U.S. contribution margin. 
Reaching maturity
Netflix completed its international expansion last January, and with that, CEO Reed Hastings signaled that the company would soon switch gears by delivering material profits in 2017. Indeed, the leading video streamer looks set to deliver on that promise as it just posted its most profitable quarter ever, with earnings per share of $0.40 and an operating margin of 9.7%.
Without any more territories to expand into, Netflix no longer has to worry about doing the legwork necessary to enter new countries -- like negotiating contracts and building brand recognition -- and it can instead focus on ramping up profits as it adds new subscribers. Subscriber growth should also be more consistent now; it has been on a year-to-year basis in the U.S. since there aren't any new market launches to jolt it.
Hastings said the company had come to see the quarterly variances in subscriber growth as ""mostly noise,"" and he laid out his long-term vision for the business, saying:



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-64365');
            });
        



Our operating margins are our key indicator of improving global profitability; they are already growing and we plan to keep them growing for many years ahead. Eventually, at a much larger revenue base, original content and revenue growth will be slower, and we anticipate substantial positive free cash flow, like our media peers.

What it means for investors
For years, Netflix was the one of the most exciting -- and lucrative -- stocks on the market. Following the Qwikster boondoggle in 2011, the stock mounted a surprising comeback, gaining nearly 1,000% over the last five years. It was a battleground stock the entire time, with analysts hotly debating its prospects and the possibility that it would ever generate significant earnings.
Now, that debate is pretty much over. Netflix is profitable in its mature international markets like Latin America, Canada, and Europe, and it's fast gaining traction in newer ones like Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. It's already reached its 2020 goal of 40% contribution margin in the U.S., hitting 41.2% in the first quarter.
Without the element of surprise it once had in quarterly earnings reports, and with the $60 billion valuation it now carries, the stock is much less likely to double in a single year, as it did in both 2013 and 2015, barring a sudden surge in subscribership and, therefore, profits. Its P/E ratio remains in the triple digits, meaning the stock will continue to be more volatile than a traditional blue chip, but all of the bear arguments against Netflix have essentially been revealed as false. 
As Hastings has said many times before, Internet TV is taking of the world, and the market for it is huge. Netflix is the industry leader, and its path to profitability is clear. The stock will continue to be a winner, but don't expect the eye-popping returns it once generated.

The real estate sector is full of opportunities for dividend investors, and to be fair, many pay significantly higher dividends than Mid-America Apartment Communities' (NYSE:MAA) 3.4% yield. However, this apartment REIT could be a great option for investors who want safe, growing dividend income, as well as the potential for market-beating returns over long time periods.
About Mid-America Apartment Communities
Mid-America Apartment Communities acquires, develops, redevelops, and manages apartment communities in the Sunbelt region of the United States, with a particularly high concentration in the Southeast.

Image source: Getty Images. (Note: Apartment complex in image is not owned my MAA.)

As of the end of 2016, the company owns or is in the process of developing more than 101,000 apartment homes. Its top three markets are Atlanta, Dallas, and Charlotte. The company's target markets have higher-than-average job growth, and the apartment properties are at price points that appeal to a large portion of the market.

Image source: Mid-America Apartment Communities investor presentation.

Mid-America Apartments is the largest apartment REIT focused on the Sunbelt region, which gives it several competitive advantages over peers. For one thing, the company's size allows it to run more efficiently than peers. It also has more financial flexibility, especially with its investment-grade (BBB+/Baa2) balance sheet, which allows it the ability to pursue new opportunities as they come up.
The growing U.S. rental market
Over the past 13 years, the U.S. homeownership rate has been steadily declining, thanks to the younger generations staying out of the housing market. These days, people tend to change jobs more often, and home prices are prohibitively expensive to many millennials. As a result, the U.S. homeownership rate is at a generational low, and the rental vacancy rate is the lowest it's been since the early 1990s.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-20583');
            });
        

Growth opportunities
One of my favorite things about Mid-America Apartment Communities is that it has tremendous potential for growth and value creation, especially over the next few years.
For starters, the company recently acquired Post Properties, another Sunbelt apartment community owner and operator, and this should produce lots of opportunities to create synergies, streamline the companies' development pipeline, and more. In all, Mid-America Apartment Communities believes that the merger, which was finalized in December 2016, will result in a total net value creation of $684 million.
I'm also a big fan of REITs that develop properties from the ground up. This way the company has the potential to create instant value for shareholders, as well as own newer, more marketable real estate assets than competitors.
Think of it this way: Let's say that the average apartment property produces a 7% return, so you can buy a $1 million property and generate $70,000 in annual income. If you can build the same property for $800,000, now your $70,000 in income translates to an 8.8% return -- plus you have an asset worth $200,000 more than you paid to build it.
As of this writing, Mid-America Apartment Communities has a $562 million development pipeline that the company estimates will result in $75 million to $80 million in value creation for shareholders. And with the nation's trend toward renting that I discussed earlier, there should be no shortage of further development opportunities in the years ahead.
In addition, the company has identified more than 15,000 units from its existing properties that are excellent candidates for redevelopment, in addition to about 13,000 from the PPS merger. This basically means renovating older apartment units, adding features like modern kitchen appliances, and will cost the company between $5,000 and $5,500 per unit. Once renovated, these units generate rental income that's 9% to 10% higher than before.
Consistent dividends with room to grow
Mid-America Apartment Communities has a rather impressive track record when it comes to delivering returns and growing income for shareholders.
Since 2006, the company has increased its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) at an annualized rate of 6.6%, which has allowed it to raise its dividend steadily, from $2.38 to $3.48, over that time period. The company has paid 92 consecutive quarterly dividends, and while it doesn't have a flawless record of raising its payment every year, it hasn't cut it either. In fact, Mid-America Apartment Communities is one of just three apartment REITs that didn't have to cut its dividend during the 2008-2009 housing crisis.

Image source: Mid-America Apartment Communities.

In addition, although the dividend has increased considerably, it represents a lower percentage of the company's income. A 66.7% payout ratio is quite low for a REIT, and implies that there is plenty of room for future dividend increases. From a safety perspective, it also means that if times get tough and earnings fall a little, the company should still be able to maintain its payout.
Over the past 20 years, Mid-America Apartment Communities has delivered average total returns of 13.1% per year, handily beating the S&P 500, as well as its apartment REIT peers.

Valuation
Mid-America Apartment Communities is projecting FFO in the range of $5.72 to $5.92 per share for 2017. Based on the midpoint of this range, the stock trades for a P/FFO multiple of 17.5. This isn't the cheapest REIT in the market, but the growth potential more than justifies this valuation.
And as you can see, this valuation is on the lower end of its peer group. For comparison, here are the P/FFO multiples for a couple of other leading apartment REITs:

",This Stock Has a 3.4% Dividend and Lots of Room to Grow
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/21/these-5-overlooked-stocks-have-absolutely-crushed.aspx,2017-04-21,"
A major misconception in investing is that the only stocks that beat the market over time are smaller, fast-growing companies in red-hot industries. You know what I'm talking about, the tech unicorns or the breakout biotech stocks. This mentality overlooks some of the best market-crushing stocks: Companies that barely make the headlines, but continually generate high rates of returns that reward shareholders. 
If you need proof that investing in companies like this are great investments, consider these five companies: water heater manufacturer A.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS), household maintenance marketer WD-40 (NASDAQ:WDFC), uniform rental specialist Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS), cosmetics and hygiene product manufacturer The Estee Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL), and aftermarket automotive parts retailer AutoZone (NYSE:AZO). Over the past decade, all of these companies have more than doubled the total return of the S&P 500. Here's a quick breakdown of why these companies are able to continuously generate market-crushing returns.

Image source: Getty Images.

What's in the sauce?
At first glance, it's not easy to see what these disparate businesses have in common. The phrase ""I need a water heater, a replacement alternator, some eyeliner, and a chef's coat"" only exists in the setup to some bizarre prank. It's not the specific products or services that these companies sell that unites them. Rather, it's the traits of those sales that make them compelling.

AOS Total Return Price data by YCharts.
There are three basic traits that all of these companies share: They are all in repeat-purchase or recurring-revenue businesses, they sell high-margin products or services, and the capital requirements for their businesses are modest. Perhaps the one company in the group here that doesn't completely fit that mold is A.O. Smith. After all, consumers aren't buying new hot water heaters every six months. That said, more than 80% of boilers and water heaters sold in North America are replacements for older systems rather than new construction. This makes sales in the business remarkably consistent.
With a well-established consumer base and consistent demand in place, each of these companies has incredible pricing power that leads to high margins. For WD-40 and Estee Lauder, that pricing power comes down to their high-value brands that command a high price point. For Cintas and A.O. Smith, it's providing and essential product of service where they are market leaders. And for AutoZone, well, selling aftermarket parts for vehicles is akin to printing money (this is coming from a person whose family was in the automotive repair business for a long time). It's no surprise, then, that all of these companies have gross margins of 40% or more.

AOS Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.
All of these things are great, but what puts all of these companies over the top is that their respective businesses don't require a lot of reinvested capital. WD-40 is the shining example of this. It doesn't even manufacture its own products -- they are contracted out and manufactured by third parties instead. Over the past 20 years, the company has only spent $65 million on capital expenditures.
While the rest of these businesses certainly aren't on the same level of asset-light businesses as WD-40, all of them are able to maintain their current operations with little capital improvements. What is also important here is that all of them are in relatively mature markets, so investing in growth is minimal. As a result, each of these companies generates loads of free cash flow on a regular basis without anywhere to reinvest it.
The best way to show this is free cash flow to assets. This metric shows how much cash the company makes for every dollar of assets in the business. In this case, all of these companies consistently generate $0.08 to $0.15 in free cash flow annually for every $1 of assets on the books. You may get better results from software companies, but for basic products and services like these, being able to convert free cash flow at those rates is a remarkable accomplishment.

AOS FCF to Assets (TTM) data by YCharts.
Putting performance to work for shareholders
With so much free cash flow, and few places to reinvest without running into the laws of diminishing returns, what better way to use it than give it back to shareholders? Dividend policies aside -- Cintas paid a special dividend in 2015 after the sale of a business line, and Estee Lauder went from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend in 2013 -- all but AutoZone have more than doubled their dividend payments over the past decade and each has payout ratios of less than 50%, which suggests there is still plenty of room to grow those payouts.
What AutoZone lacks in a dividend payment, it makes up for with share repurchases. While all of these companies have used share repurchases to reduce share counts and increase per-share value for shareholders, AutoZone really takes the cake here as it has bought back more than half of all shares outstanding over the past 10 years. 

AOS Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts.
The one-two punch of dividends and share repurchases can go a long way toward growing shareholder value, especially when businesses like these are in mature or constrained markets.

What a Fool believes
If you are on the hunt for market-crushing stocks, chances are you will look at the high-flying, newsworthy companies that analysts espouse for their ability to disrupt the status quo. In reality, though, companies that keep the status quo can be just as valuable for your portfolio. No one is going to think you are a Wall Street soothsayer for owning stocks in cosmetics, auto parts, work uniform rentals, or hot water heaters. But if you want to grow wealth over time, it's hard to argue with what A.O. Smith, WD-40, Cintas, Estee Lauder, and AutoZone have to offer. 

",These 5 Overlooked Stocks Have Absolutely Crushed the Market
http://www.fool.com/taxes/2017/04/19/are-dividends-taxed-at-a-lower-rate.aspx,2017-04-19,"
Ignore dividends at your own peril. You may think of them as sleepy investments for grandparents, but that's outdated thinking. Dividends are powerful wealth generators. According to Ibbotson Associates, dividends generated about 42% of the 10.04% average annual total return of the S&P 500 Index from January 1926 through December 2016.
But wait -- it gets better -- because in many cases, dollars from dividends are taxed at a lower rate than other dollars.

Image source: Getty Images.

Let's take a closer look at how your dividends may be taxed.
Qualified vs. unqualified dividends
First, remember that there are a bunch of tax brackets reflecting the percentage of tax that's levied on your income. The brackets apply to much of your taxable income, but long-term capital gains (from qualifying assets held for more than a year) get a more favorable tax rate, as do qualified dividends. You can see the difference in this chart:



Tax Bracket/Ordinary Dividend Tax Rate

Qualified Dividend Tax Rate





10%


0%




15%


0%




25%


15%




28%


15%




33%


15%




35%


15%




39.6%


20%




Data source: IRS.gov.
To be considered ""qualified,"" the dividends need to have been paid by a U.S. corporation or a qualified foreign corporation, and must be regular dividends -- not distributions of capital gains or dividends from a savings account at a bank or anything like that. You have to have owned the dividend-paying stock for a particular minimum time period, too, explained here by the IRS:

You must have held the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the first date following the declaration of a dividend on which the buyer of a stock is not entitled to receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller will get the dividend.

Got it? It is a bit confusing, but rest assured that most dividends paid to you by most companies you can invest in will be qualified. For most of us, that means an appealingly low 15% tax rate on them. Learn more about the rules from the IRS itself.

Dividends inside IRAs
Of course, some dividends come from stocks you hold in an IRA. How do they get taxed? Well, it depends on the kind of IRA it is. If you invest within a Roth IRA and follow the rules (having had the account for at least five years and being at least 59 1/2 years old when withdrawing), when it comes time to withdraw from it in retirement, you'll be able to make tax-free withdrawals. That includes any dividends that various holdings generated. So when it comes to dividends in a Roth IRA, the tax rate is generally 0%.
Traditional IRAs are different, though. Contributions to a traditional IRA are made on a pre-tax basis, so money taken from one does get taxed -- but only when you withdraw it. Until then it grows on a tax-deferred basis. When your withdrawals are taxed, though, it's not at any long-term capital gains tax rate but at your ordinary income tax rate -- reflected in the tax brackets above. That's true no matter whether the withdrawal is made up of capital gains, dividends, and/or interest. This can still be a good deal, as your tax bracket may be 28% when you're working and only 15% when you're retired.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-37594');
            });
        

Double taxation of dividends
Finally, it's worth reviewing the common gripe about dividends, that they get taxed twice. Imagine that you own shares of stock in Free Range Onion Company (Ticker: BULBZ). You and the other shareholders actually own the company, which takes in revenue and aims to produce profits. Before the company arrives at your profit, though, it pays its corporate taxes.
After it has paid taxes, Free Range Onion Company may have a profit left over. It can do lots of things with that money, such as paying off debts, reinvesting in its business, buying back some shares, or paying a dividend. If it pays you a dividend, it's doing so with money that has already been taxed -- yet you will probably be taxed on it, too.

The power of dividends
No matter how they're taxed, dividend-paying stocks are well worth considering for your portfolio. Not convinced? Consider this: Researchers Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, studying data from 1927 to 2014, found that dividend payers outperformed non-payers, averaging 10.4% annual growth vs. 8.5%. The table below shows how a seemingly modest difference in growth rates can make a big difference over the long run to annual investments of $10,000:

For minimum taxation of your dividends, keep them in a Roth IRA. But no matter where you have them, according to current rules, most are likely to face a tax rate of no more than 15%.

Ah, retirement. The golden years. This is the time to be catching up on your reading, playing with your grandkids, maybe seeing the world a bit -- but definitely not a time to be worrying about whether your stock portfolio will crash.
To help you accomplish the former things, and avoid the latter, here is a screen for stocks offering four attributes that should appeal to retirees -- and really, anyone looking to own a safe stock

They have recognizable brand names and are established companies with over a $2 billion market cap.
They pay a respectable dividend, at least 4%.
They don't zig and zag with every wobble in the stock market, showing a beta of less than 1.0.
They don't cost a lot -- at least 20% cheaper than the stock market's 26.5 P/E ratio.


Image source: Getty Images.

Here are three foreign companies that fit the bill. 
Korea Electric Power Corporation 
Home to brand-name powerhouses such as Samsung and Hyundai, South Korea has grown over the past half-century into one of the world's richest countries and has transformed its economy from one based on subsistence farming into a leader in high tech. But here's the thing about high-tech economies -- they need electricity to run on, and that's where Korea Electric Power Corporation (NYSE:KEP) comes in.
Generating 93% of South Korea's electric power, KEPCO is majority-owned by the government -- but the remainder of its stock is available for investment, and I think it's worth a look. Why? Let's start with the valuation. KEPCO stock sells for a mere 4 times trailing earnings. That's far cheaper than the average valuation on the S&P 500, and a cheap price even for the company's rather low projected earnings growth rate of 3% (according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.) On top of that, KEPCO pays its shareholders a 4.4% annual dividend that's more than twice the average 2.1% on the S&P. 
Can KEPCO keep up the dividend and even add capital gains from a rising stock price? I think so. The large asset sale that temporarily boosted earnings at KEPCO in 2015 has now rolled off the books, but earnings remain strong, and the stock's P/E today is still remarkably low. With analysts forecasting continued earnings growth, my feeling is that, if you believe in the South Korean economic miracle, you have to believe that the future for Korea Electric Power Corporation -- the company providing power to 93% of that miracle -- is secure.
SK Telecom Co., Ltd.
Our second ""safe international"" candidate also hails from South Korea. While SK Telecom Co., Ltd. (NYSE:SKM) is hardly a household name here, in his new book The New Koreans, Korea specialist Michael Breen identifies the company as one part of South Korea's fourth largest chaebol industrial conglomerate. (There are 61 chaebol in all, with Samsung, Hyundai, and LG being the other three, and the best-known internationally). Collectively, these four conglomerates produce 10% of South Korea's GDP -- making them arguably ""too big to fail.""
You can see this stability reflected in SK's low beta of 0.6. Yet despite the stability of its stock, and its outsize role in the economy, SK sports a very reasonable valuation of just 10.4 times trailing earnings -- much cheaper than most S&P stocks, which average a P/E of 26.1. SK also pays a pretty nice dividend of 4.4%.
Breen describes South Korea as a country dominated by such corporate giants. While SK Telecom doesn't control KEPCO's outsize share of the market for telecommunications, it is the nation's largest provider of mobile communications. It's also likely to further entrench its position by virtue of the gargantuan wireless area network it's installed throughout the country, which will give 99% of the South Korean population access to Wi-Fi and enable a nationwide Internet of Things. 
Given its leading market position, investments to strengthen that position further -- and of course, its high dividend, a respectable growth rate of 7.7%, and a low P/E, I think SK Telecom is also worth a look.

BCE Inc. 
And now, finally shifting our focus away from South Korea, we circle over to North America to take a look at Canadian telco BCE Inc. (NYSE:BCE).
Canada's third largest provider of mobile telephony (second largest, postpaid), BCE is something like the AT&T of Canada -- but cheaper. Valued at 18.3 times earnings, BCE offers investors a combination of modest growth rates and a beefy 4.7% dividend yield. And in terms of volatility, BCE stock is exceptionally stable, showing less than a 0.4 beta that barely registers a shudder when the rest of the market drops (or jumps).
That could be good news for new investors, because BCE is expected to report earnings next week, on April 26. Analysts predict that the company will report revenue growth of about 2% but show about a 3% drop in earnings year over year. But given how imperturbable the stock has proved over the years, even a decline in earnings probably won't disturb investors overmuch -- so long as the decline isn't too much worse than is already expected.
After all, analysts quoted on S&P Global seem pretty certain BCE will keep on growing at a relatively steady 3% clip over the next five years. Plus, there are the fat dividend checks rolling in every quarter. Together, those two factors should make BCE a relatively stress-free stock to invest in if you're retired. 
","If You're Retired, Consider Buying These 3 Stocks"
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/11/veeva-systems-inc-buy-at-the-high.aspx,2017-04-11,"
The story behind Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) is pretty simple. Peter Gassner, founder of the company, used to be an executive at Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). While he was convincing companies to try out Salesforce's cloud solutions, he realized that the pharmaceutical industry had some very unique needs that Salesforce's build-it-yourself infrastructure couldn't meet.
So, in 2007, he decided to strike out on his own, leaving Salesforce to found Veeva. His first product for the market was Veeva CRM (customer relationship management), which helped drug companies track what their sales force was doing and who was buying their drugs. The company then expanded out to Veeva Vault -- focused on recording, storing, sharing, and abiding by regulatory laws. The strategy has worked, and the stock has responded in kind.

If you want a piece of the company now, it might seem like you've missed the boat. Does that mean you should avoid buying shares while they're at all-time highs? Or should you bite the bullet and pay up for quality? Here's how to think about it.
There's no denying this is expensive
Without a doubt, Veeva is expensive. By almost every traditional metric, shares are pricey. Consider the following, and compare it to Veeva's much larger peer, Salesforce.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-96064');

While the two look comparable in terms of what they'll earn in 2017, Veeva trades at a 50% premium in terms of free cash flow, and a 35% premium relative to its growth rates. And this completely ignores how Veeva is valued relative to the typical S&P 500 stock: While the average stock in the S&P 500 trades for about 26 times trailing earnings, Veeva's P/E ratio is over 100. 

Image source: Getty Images.

The bottom line is this: Veeva stock is expensive. Any troubles the company might experience with competition, weaker-than-expected outlooks, or even increased investments for the future could cause the stock to drop somewhat dramatically... at least over the short run.
That's why I don't think it's wise to ""back up the truck"" at this point.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-68060');
            });
        


But there's so much going in the company's favor
At the same time, Veeva has so much going for it. Chief among everything else is the company's moat. When a drug company signs on to Veeva CRM, it would be loath to switch to another CRM provider. Doing so would not only be expensive, but it would be cumbersome and likely lead to lots of headaches. We call that kind of a moat ""high switching costs.""
And if switching costs with a CRM platform seem high, imagine how much higher it would be if a company like Veeva was storing all of your mission-critical data from clinical trials! That's why, once a company signs on with Veeva and starts using multiple products, they will likely only switch away if (1) the service becomes awful or (2) it becomes prohibitively expensive.
Therefore, its important to see what kind of business momentum Veeva has going for it. Since 2012, revenue has grown at a compounded rate of 43% per year! That alone speaks to the company's success.
But if you still aren't convinced, it's worth taking a look at how many drug companies are signing up to use Veeva's services.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-81208');
            });
        



Data source: Veeva annual report.
And keep in mind, this is just a single year's growth. CRM used to be the company's bread and butter, and Vault has only been available at scale for a little over three years now.
And all of this ignores the huge announcement Veeva made last year: It is looking to offer its cloud solution outside of the pharmaceutical market. Specifically, the company will be offering a solution called Vault QualityOne. The service will be focused initially on industries that tend to be heavily regulated, like chemicals, manufacturing, or consumer packaged goods.
As a recent interview with The Motley Fool by Veeva president Matt Wallach highlights, this move has the potential to drastically expand Veeva's total addressable market.
So, how should you approach the situation? I suggest that if you're truly interested in this high-growth, high-moat business, you should open a ""starter"" position and set aside cash for buying at better and better value points in the future. Such value points might not necessarily mean ""lower share price,"" but instead a lower P/FCF ratio, or some other measure.
By doing so, you have skin in the game to keep you exposed to the upside, while still having some dry powder to use should the stock fall. That's my approach now. Veeva makes up 3.5% of my real-life holdings, but I would have no problem increasing that significantly if the market gave me the opportunity.

Financial stocks gave back another small piece of the larger gains they've seen since the start of the year. Selling pressure in that industry pushed the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) lower by 0.3%. On the other hand, a solid uptick in gold prices sparked a 6.1% gain in the bullish bet on the precious metal, Direxion Daily Jr Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:JNUG).
As for individual stocks, RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE) and SUPERVALU (NYSE:SVU) attracted heavy investor interest following merger and acquisition news.

RetailMeNot's buyout
RetailMeNot shares spiked over 48% after the company agreed to an acquisition. The digital discounting specialist struck a deal to deliver its audience distribution and brand to Harland Clarke for $11.60 per share in cash, which equates to a 50% boost over yesterday's closing price.

Harland Clarke intends to combine these assets with its Valassis consumer media targeting brand. ""RetailMeNot provides a new global digital channel to distribute our clients' offers that perfectly complements Valassis' current digital, mobile, mail and other print networks,"" Harland Clark CEO Victor Nichols said in a press release.
RetailMeNot executives sounded a positive tone in arguing that the deal represented the best path forward for the business in both the short and long term. ""Not only are we delivering an immediate and significant cash premium to our stockholders,"" CEO Cotter Cunningham said, ""but we are also meaningfully advancing our goal of becoming a leading savings destination for consumers.""
Recent shareholders are likely to agree with management given the stock's 35% spike over the past 12 months. Those who have owned the stock through its wider struggles are likely booking losses from this deal; shares are still down 22% since the start of 2015.

SUPERVALU invests in the wholesale business
Shares of supermarket chain and grocery wholesaler SUPERVALU jumped as much as 11.1% on Tuesday before settling down to a more modest 5.5% gain. The volatility followed news that the company is acquiring the wholesale grocery distributor Unified Grocers in a deal valued at $375 million.
The purchase looks like a good fit for SUPERVALU, since the new business will immediately boost its wholesale segment by creating a combined network of 24 distribution centers and a client base of over 3,000 stores. While SUPERVALU's retailing division has been suffering under the weight of price deflation in the grocery industry, its wholesale segment is faring better, and in fact increased sales in its most recently reported quarter. It makes sense, then, that executives would seek to press their advantage in that arena.
""By acquiring the Unified business ... we will become a stronger and more efficient organization,"" SUPERVALU CEO Mark Gross said. ""The transaction will enhance our ability to help our customers better compete in the evolving grocery industry.""
The details of the transaction call for SUPERVALU to pay $114 million for full ownership of United Grocers' business, at which point it will pay off the company's debt of approximately $261 million. SUPERVALU expects significant cost synergies from the deal, but its success will ultimately be judged on whether or not it significantly bolsters the wholesale segment in the years ahead.

President Trump's promise of a highly anticipated tax-cut plan gave the markets enough fuel to sustain small weekly gains late Friday. The S&P 500 was up 0.85% for the week, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by a lesser 0.46%. The news wasn't a complete surprise, as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a mere day prior that Trump's tax plan would be released shortly. In other news, there were plenty of companies making big moves or big headlines in the markets this week. Here are some highlights.
This stock is soaring
It's been a dreamlike month for investors of Straight Path Communications Inc. (NYSEMKT:STRP), which has soared 205% in April after the news that AT&T (NYSE:T) agreed to acquire it earlier this month -- but the development became even more intriguing this week, when another bidder was said to be considering a bid of its own. 

Image source: Getty Images.

On April 10, AT&T announced that it would acquire Straight Path in hopes of boosting its development of 5G technology and infrastructure. Straight Path has developed a nationwide portfolio of millimeter-wave spectrum, which is hugely important to AT&T in the increasingly competitive wireless market. AT&T agreed to pay $95.63 per share, for a total value of about $1.6 billion, including liabilities. 
In the most recent development, Straight Path revealed in a regulatory filing that an unnamed third party -- which, according to sources talking to Reuters, is likely to be Verizon -- was considering a competitive offer that's expected to exceed AT&T's price. We'll see how this shakes out for investors, but chances are this is at, or perhaps even above, a fair premium for the company. It also shows just how important and valuable companies with a portfolio of 5G technology are becoming, and savvy investors should keep that in mind.
Better than bad
Shares of GNC Holdings (NYSE:GNC) also had a good week, after surging around 20% during intra-day trading on Tuesday. The driving force behind the move higher, you ask? It was simply a better-than-expected first-quarter earnings report, which still included a revenue decline.
Before we get to the details of GNC's first quarter, it's important to put this week's roughly 13% gain in perspective -- because it's been a really rough few years for investors.

GNC data by YCharts
GNC's revenue declined 3.6% to $644.8 million during the first quarter. Despite the decline, that was about $17 million better than analysts had estimated. Adjusted earnings per share checked in at $0.37, much lower than the prior year's $0.69 but still $0.03 better than analysts' expectations.
Slightly worse than GNC's total revenue decline was its comparable-store sales, which dropped 3.9% -- although that, too, was better than the fourth quarter's far worse 8.6% decline in comparable-store sales. GNC's average transaction declined by more than 12% during the first quarter, and sales at GNC.com fell by 7.2%. 
Ultimately, if investors want to sum up GNC's first quarter, it's fair to say it was better than very dismal expectations. And the stock's 13% gain this week pales in comparison with the value the stock has shed over the past couple of years. Management has some work to do if it wants to turn the business around.

The value of plastic
Last but not least, shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) jumped higher on Thursday, after investors were impressed with first-quarter earnings. The company's earnings per share of $1.34, while down 8% compared with the prior year, topped analysts' estimates calling for $1.28 per share. Excluding the company's Costco-related business, as well as foreign exchange rates, its adjusted revenue net of interest expense grew 7%, in part because card-carrying consumers are spending more.
""The last couple of years have been an important transition period, and we've entered 2017 stronger, more focused, and more resilient,"" said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, in a press release. ""There is still work to do, but our underlying performance this quarter gives me added confidence in our ability to deliver our 2017 EPS outlook of $5.60-$5.80 and position American Express for sustainable growth in the years ahead.""  
American Express is difficult to figure out currently. It has a premium brand image and generates strong profits, but it's recently been cutting costs. American Express cut marketing and promotional spending by 4% over the past 12 months, according to Morningstar.com, at a time when competition is increasing.
American Express has a strong business and brand, but the future of mobile payments and increasing competition from other credit cards make beating the market for its investors far from a guarantee. 

",What Investors Missed in the Market This Week
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/03/24/3-top-etfs-for-new-investors.aspx,2017-03-24,"
At The Motley Fool, we obviously love researching and investing in stocks. However, not every investor has the time, desire, or capital required to create a well-diversified portfolio of individual stocks -- especially new investors. Fortunately, through the magic of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, new investors can invest in stocks without having to invest thousands of dollars or spend hours researching and planning investments. Here are three in particular that new investors can use to form an excellent ""base"" to their portfolio.
Warren Buffett's favorite ETF
Although he's known as one of the best stock-pickers of all time, billionaire investor Warren Buffett has said several times that the best investment most people can make is a simple low-cost S&P 500 ETF. In fact, he's nine years into a 10-year bet that such a fund of his choosing could beat a set of at least five hedge funds. Buffett's pick for the bet? The Vanguard S&P 500 index fund, which is available in both ETF and mutual fund forms.

Image source: Getty Images.

As the name implies, this ETF tracks the S&P 500 index, which is composed of 500 of the largest publicly traded American companies. And don't think by simply investing in an index fund like this that you'll be sacrificing performance -- over long periods of time, the S&P 500 has averaged annual returns of 9-10% (including dividends), and has outperformed 80% of actively managed large-cap mutual funds over the past 10 years.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO) is an excellent option for new investors, as it's a diverse basket of the largest U.S. companies, and comes with an extremely low expense ratio (annual management fee) of just 0.05%. In other words, if your initial investment in the fund is for $1,000, this translates to an annual management fee of just $0.50.
A little more risk, a little more reward potential
The iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NYSEMKT:IUSG) invests in companies with above-average growth potential. Specifically, the fund tracks the S&P 900 Growth Index, which is composed of large- and mid-cap U.S. companies that exhibit growth characteristics.
Growth stocks are generally defined as companies whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the average company within the same industry.
Growth stocks tend to be a bit more volatile than value stocks, which are generally more stable and mature businesses. To give you an idea of the type of companies that qualify as ""growth"" stocks, the fund's top five holdings are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet (Google). Not surprisingly, there are a lot of tech stocks in the index, due to the growing nature of the industry. Because of this inherent volatility risk, growth stocks are an especially good candidate for ETF investors, new and experienced.
So, over the short term, these stocks can move up and down quite a bit (check out a 5-year chart of Facebook), but they certainly have higher growth potential over the long run. This makes this ETF an especially good choice for new investors who are relatively young and have a long time horizon to ride out the ups and downs. And with an expense ratio of just 0.05%, it's tough to find a cheaper growth stock ETF option.

High-dividend stocks can help protect you in a downturn
Dividend stocks tend to hold up better than their non-dividend counterparts during recessions, and also tend to deliver better long-term returns. One great ETF that not only invests exclusively in dividend stocks, but specifically focuses on stocks with above-average dividends, is the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM). (NOTE: If you couldn't tell by my suggestions, I'm a big fan of Vanguard ETFs, thanks to their extremely low fees.)
The High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which is a collection of stocks (412 to be exact) that pay above-average dividend yields, specifically excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs). As of March 2017, the fund pays a 2.8% dividend yield.
Among the fund's top investments are rock-solid American companies such as Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. Like the other Vanguard fund I discussed, this one also has an extremely low expense ratio -- 0.08% in this case.

The broad-based S&P 500 is on fire, with the index gaining nearly 13% over the trailing 12-month period -- but that doesn't mean every stock has participated in the rally. Some very good companies have hit speed bumps recently that have left them looking up at an outperforming index. 
However, these short-term dips could represent an excellent buying opportunity for patient investors who have a long-term perspective on their investments. With this in mind, we asked three of our Foolish contributors to name a stock they believe has the potential to reverse its recent weakness and rise significantly over the long-term. Rising to the top of the list were Silver Wheaton (NYSE:SLW), Kroger (NYSE:KR), and PotashCorp (NYSE:POT). 

Image source: Getty Images.

A quick polish is all it would take to bring back this stocks' luster 
Sean Williams (Silver Wheaton): Precious-metal royalty and streaming company Silver Wheaton took a pounding following the election of Donald Trump as investors began placing their wagers on a higher growth environment with the legislative branches of government dominated by a single party. This optimism pushed the prices of physical gold and silver substantially lower over the course of the next month.
The company also faced a negative reaction from the announcement that workers at Primero Mining's San Dimas mine, a key silver-producing asset for Silver Wheaton, had gone on strike. All told, shares of Silver Wheaton have dipped by more than 30% in just eight months. This dip, though, appears to be a great buying opportunity for long-term investors.
As a shareholder, one of first factors you really come to appreciate with a company like Silver Wheaton is its business model. Because it focuses on royalty and streaming, Silver Wheaton has pretty minimal overhead expenses, and its margins are better than any traditional miner. According to the company's full-year report from 2016, its average cash cost was just $4.42 per silver ounce and $391 per gold ounce. This provides a better than $13 margin per ounce for silver and a more than $850 per ounce margin for gold. In other words, it would take a serious decline in precious-metal prices to crimp Silver Wheaton's profits.  
Second, Silver Wheaton has a pretty well-diversified production portfolio. Though San Dimas does account for a notable percentage of silver production, no single mine is going to topple Silver Wheaton from being profitable. This ample diversification, and its extremely long-term contracts, ensure some degree of predictable cash flow.

Silver Wheaton may also benefit from precious-metal market dynamics. Precious metals appear poised to benefit from the uncertainty of a Trump presidency, the exit of Britain from the European Union, and the reemergence of inflation in the United States. No company benefits more directly from the perspective of margin when precious metals increase in price than Silver Wheaton.
A little spot shine is all it should take to make Silver Wheaton look lustrous over the long-term once more.
Cleanup on aisle three
Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Kroger): Kroger is one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P 500 so far this year, but that drop could spell opportunity for patient investors. Yes, the grocery chain has fallen on tough times lately. Sales growth was a meager 1% in 2016, compared with the prior year's 5% spike. 
Like industry peers, Kroger's business has been hurt by aggressive deflation in key grocery departments such as meat, dairy, and eggs. In fact, a 1.3% decline in prices last quarter played the biggest role in the company's posting negative quarterly same-store sales for the first time in over a decade.
Yet the retailer improved the volume, or tonnage of sales, and also closed out its 12th straight year of market share gains in 2016. In-store brands made up a record share of the business, too, thanks in part to continued booming results from its organic franchise, Simple Truth.

Image source: Getty Images.

These wins suggest that it won't be long before the grocer returns to its long-term growth target of improving earnings by between 8% and 11% each year -- in addition to a growing dividend. Deflation is likely to weigh down results at least through the rest of 2017. But, as CEO Rodney McMullen explained to investors recently, ""We know from past experience the environment won't be deflationary forever."" Similarly long-term minded investors might want to snatch up shares of this successful grocer at a relative bargain of 14 times the past year's earnings.

Because people need to eat
Rich Smith (PotashCorp): I don't know how short your definition of a ""short-term dip"" may be, but regardless of the length, the ""dip"" PotashCorp stock has endured probably fits the bill. Down 16% since its highs of late January, and down 64% since its highest price hit in the past five years -- any way you look at it, this fertilizer miner is sitting deep in a hole.
But perhaps not for long.
Oh, I'll admit that PotashCorp stock doesn't look terribly attractive today. Priced at 44 times trailing earnings, or even at an above-market valuation of 24 times what it's expected to earn next year, this stock certainly doesn't look cheap. But looks can be deceiving.
PotashCorp, you see, is a cyclical stock, waxing when farm incomes are flush, and waning when crop prices dive or when the fertilizer market is in oversupply. With PotashCorp plumbing multiyear lows, that seems to be the position PotashCorp is in right now, and as a result, Potash profits have almost never been lower.

Image source: PotashCorp.

Last year, PotashCorp earned a mere $323 million in net profit -- a full 75% less than it earned in 2015. But here's the thing: Cyclical markets also go up. How far up? Take a look at the company's historical performance .
You need look back no farther than six years to find PotashCorp earning profits of as much as $3 billion a year (nearly 10 times last year's haul). Go back three years more, and you'll see PotashCorp demonstrating an ability to earn as much as $3.5 billion when the agricultural market is most propitious. So while PotashCorp may look expensive today, there are going to be years ahead when the stars will align for farmers, and for their suppliers, and PotashCorp will earn profits sufficient to make today's market capitalization a mere four-times multiple of annual profits.
When will this happen? Only the good Lord, and perhaps the Farmer's Almanac, know for sure. But you can bet your bottom dollar that food prices, and fertilizer prices will get expensive again at some time in the future -- because people need to eat. And that's the time you'll wish you had bought PotashCorp during this short-term dip.

",This Short-Term Dip Is a Great Time to Buy These Long-Term Stocks
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/22/3-times-donald-trump-moved-the-market-this-month.aspx,2017-04-22,"
Donald Trump's not shy when it comes to sharing his opinion, and his straight-to-the-point approach has caused investors to whipsaw in and out of sectors, industries, and stocks since his election last November. Most recently, his comments about the dollar, and uncertainty regarding trade-deals and infrastructure plans, have taken a big toll on the U.S. dollar; banks; and steel, copper, and iron ore stocks.
Dumping the dollar?
Anders Bylund (dollar exchange policy): U.S. presidents tend to avoid talking about the dollar's exchange rates, and they very rarely take a direct hand in setting international policy for this key financial data point. If forced to post direct commentary on the direction of the dollar, most Oval Office residents have preferred to stick with the mantra that a strong dollar equals a strong economy.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Donald Trump broke rank with these traditions last week, and his words immediately pushed dollar values lower.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said, ""our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that's my fault because people have confidence in me. But that's hurting -- that will hurt ultimately.""
Looking past Trump's tendency to pat his own back for a global economic trend that started way back in 2014, it's true that a strong dollar can limit American export sales. Rising exchange rates can also push down oil prices in the long run, make gold a less-attractive value preserver, and change the game for many other investable markets.
We'll see how long Trump will stick to his stated preference for a weaker dollar. Chances are, he'll change his tune again when his advisors get around to explaining how the currency trade actually works. It's a balancing game where every action comes with an equal and opposite reaction, and the American economy you see today was built on the tenets of lifting and protecting the dollar's international standing.
Tough export markets are paired with cheap imports, and a strong currency ultimately rests on the solid ground of economic fundamentals. Among the true drivers of long-term currency power, you'll find low unemployment and high productivity levels. Would Trump really prefer cutting American jobs in exchange for better-looking export statistics?
It wasn't just the dollar Trump hurt 
Jason Hall (bank stocks): Trump's recent claim that the dollar was ""too strong"" didn't just affect the U.S. dollar; his comments also had a big, market-moving effect on bank stocks. 
Bank stocks have been on a tear since Trump's election, driven up by predictions that republicans would begin easing regulations and lowering corporate tax rates, which would boost bank profits. Factor in expectations that interest rates are likely to steadily -- if slowly -- increase in the coming years, and that's a third reason investors have flocked to bank stocks since last November, which have generated nearly double the returns as a category than the S&P 500 since the election. 
However, Trump's comments about the dollar were only part of his statement. He also said, ""I do like a low interest rate policy,"" and those words reverberated across the banking sector, sending many bank stocks down significantly more than the rest of the market following his comments:

Many investors who expect rates to steadily increase got spooked by Trump's words. The sad irony is, many bank stocks have regained the short-term losses following Trump's comments. This is at least in part because, despite having the biggest bully pulpit from which to speak, the president has -- and many investors likely figured this out after the fact -- little direct control over a lot of economic policy. 
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's term doesn't expire until January 2018, and even though Trump could remove her as chair, she would remain on the board, and her fellow board members are generally committed to the same slow, steady rate hike policy Yellen has supported.

Slipping steel, copper, and iron ore stocks
Todd Campbell (steel, copper, and iron ore): When it comes to the recent nosedive in steel, copper, and iron ore stocks, it's more about what Trump hasn't said than what he has said.
Trump is a vocal supporter of a massive infrastructure spending program, but there's mounting fear that he won't be able to get such a program passed in Congress.
The hope of a spike in U.S. infrastructure spending and tariffs on foreign steel caused steel, copper, and iron ore stocks with U.S. market exposure to soar after the election. Some stocks, such as Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE:CLF) -- a major provider of iron ore pellets to U.S. steel producers -- more than doubled.
However, following Trump's failure to win an Obamacare repeal-and-replace vote shows how tricky it is to get policy across the legislative finish line, and that's causing investors to walk back their optimism in these stocks. 
Investors are now left wondering what his strategy will be on infrastructure. Will he embrace tax reform or infrastructure first? Will he merge the two policies into one bill to strong-arm support? We simply don't know what his current thinking is on infrastructure.
Adding more worry is Trump's shifting rhetoric toward China. China is notorious for dumping steel (via South Korea) on U.S. markets, but Trump has been saying lately that he'll be easier on China on trade if it helps keep North Korea in check. If so, his softening on trade raises additional questions for steel, copper, and iron ore investors.

Overall, the steel, copper, and iron ore ""trade"" has become way more uncertain than it was in January, and that makes these stocks incredibly risky. Having said that, these stocks have given back a lot of their gains, and after their drop, they may be under-pricing potential growth from ongoing U.S. economic expansion. Also, there's still a very real chance of an infrastructure bill passing at some point, and if it does, these stocks could head higher again.

Franklin Covey's business-model shift
Franklin Covey shares spiked 26% to regain nearly all the ground they had lost in 2017. The catalyst for the jump was the business performance software specialist's announcement of fiscal second-quarter earnings results. Sales and profit figures met management's targets, with revenue dipping slightly to $42.2 million from $45.3 million a year ago, and operating loss expanding to $4.5 million from $0.3 million.

Results were held back by strong demand for Franklin Covey's new product offering that provides unlimited access to a wide range of its intellectual property for a specified period of time. Contracts for that pass more than doubled to $7.8 million.
The bad news is the shift toward this ""all access"" product hurts revenue and profits in the short term. However, executives believe it's ultimately a great move for the business. The transition ""will provide growth in future periods through higher initial sale sizes, consistently strong renewals, and from sales of add-on services and training materials,"" CEO Bob Whitman said in a press release. The recent quarter provides a good example of that last point, as the company booked $3.5 million worth of add-on materials attached to all-access pass sales. Investors expressed their optimism that Franklin Covey could see sharper growth ahead by bidding the stock past $20 per share on Friday.
",What Happened in the Stock Market Today
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/18/why-analysts-are-suddenly-bullish-on-wal-mart.aspx,2017-04-18,"
You only need to check the latest headlines to know the retail industry is suffering. Brick-and-mortar chains are closing hundreds of stores as e-commerce and other forces have brought about a sea change in the industry.
Retail stocks, especially those of department stores and apparel chains, have widely underperformed the market, missing out on the post-election rally as investors turn sour on the sector.

Image source: Wal-Mart.

However, there's been one notable exception: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Over the last three months, the world's biggest retailer has outperformed both the retail sector and the broad-market S&P 500.

WMT data by YCharts.
Optimism seems to be building for Wal-Mart's strategy to take on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and grow sales, and analysts have taken notice. Since September, the stock has received four upgrades to buy ratings, and three other brokerages have initiated coverage at a buy, or its equivalent. 



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-62920');
            });
        


The most recent upgrade came from Telsey Advisory Group, which lifted its rating on Wal-Mart from market perform to outperform. Analyst Joseph Feldman touted the retailer's return to ""dominance"" in physical retail and ""new prowess"" in e-commerce. He also raised his price target from $73 to $82.
Let's take a look at a few of the reasons why analysts have turned bullish on the once-maligned retailer.
Being proactive on e-commerce
Under the direction of Marc Lore, who came to Wal-Mart with its acquisition of Jet.com last year, Wal-Mart has been moving quickly to catch up to Amazon.
Lore has guided three acquisitions of online retailers in recent months, including ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, and ModCloth, and Wal-Mart is currently in advanced talks to buy men's fashion site Bonobos. Those moves should help Wal-Mart reach a new customer demographic, and its economies of scale should help boost distribution and lower costs.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-10791');
            });
        


Lore has also been making efforts to improve Wal-Mart's own e-commerce platform. In January, the company announced that it would offer free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more for millions of items, a move that approaches Amazon Prime's free two-day shipping without a minimum order. Amazon also responded by lowering its free-shipping minimum for non-Prime members to $35 from $50.
Earlier this month, Wal-Mart made a move that Amazon will have more trouble copying, saying it will offer discounts on online-only items if customers come pick them up stores. The offer leverages Wal-Mart's massive store footprint, and it could be an important differentiator on some online sales since many Americans already visit a Wal-Mart regularly to do their grocery shopping.
Lowering prices
For years, Wal-Mart has positioned itself on its promise of everyday low prices with slogans like ""Save money. Live better."" But in recent years, the company has lost some of that price leadership. Costco Wholesale, for example, sells bulk goods nearly at cost, and Amazon and dollar-store chains have consistently picked off market share from Wal-Mart in part from their perception of lower prices.
More recently, though, Wal-Mart has been aggressively lowering prices to win back market share. The company has been pressuring its suppliers to lower prices, and it launched price tests at 1,200 stores across the country in order to win back share from dollar-store chains and newer low-price competitors like Aldi. 



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-50254');
            });
        


Those efforts and others have yielded results as Wal-Mart's comparable sales, which have increased nine quarters in a row, have outperformed rivals including department stores, mass merchandisers like Target, and other grocery chains like Kroger.
Under CEO Doug McMillon, the company has shown it is willing to sacrifice profits in order to boost sales and market share as the company has made several such investments, including raising its minimum wage to $10/hour, enhancing its training program, making efforts to clean up stores, and expanding its grocery pickup kiosks.
The company understands that growth is more important than profits, especially as it needs to keep up with Amazon. As it makes more such investments to improve sales, Wall Street analysts should continue to take notice, and their approval should help send the stock higher.

",Why Analysts Are Suddenly Bullish on Wal-Mart
http://www.fool.com/investing/2017/03/11/3-high-yield-etfs-that-could-power-your-portfolio.aspx,2017-03-11,"
If you're wary of the risks associated with owning individual stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be an excellent substitute, especially for income investors. High-yield ETFs provide exposure to a diverse basket of dividend stocks, allowing you to earn fat dividend checks without having to spend time researching individual stocks.
However, not all high-yield ETFs are safe or give you value for your money. So to help you make sound investing decisions, our contributors have picked three high-yield ETFs that they believe could power up your portfolio: Global X SuperDividend ETF (NYSEMKT:SDIV), iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (NYSEMKT:PFF), and PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (NYSEMKT:SPHD). All three ETFs are unique, so read on to learn which one suits you best.

Image source: Getty Images.

U.S. familiarity with a dose of international exposure
Rich Smith (Global X SuperDividend ETF): Last month, I made the case for seeking out ETFs focused on international dividends, arguing that if the U.S. dollar is strong now, then it must eventually weaken, making foreign dividend-paying stocks a smarter investment play for the long term. I still think that way today.
But what if I'm wrong?
Nobody's perfect, and I think it's a fine strategy to hedge one's bets against the possibility that one is wrong. In that vein, today I'm going to suggest you take a look at a more balanced ETF -- one primarily weighted toward U.S. stocks but with a healthy leavening of international dividend exposure as well: the Global X SuperDividend ETF.
ETF.com describes the fund as a ""high-yielding basket"" that ""favors small firms,"" mostly in the financials and energy sectors. But while Global X SuperDividend leans toward small companies, it's not a small fund.
In fact, the Global X SuperDividend ETF boasts nearly $850 million in assets under management. It pays a whopping 6.6% dividend yield, which, after deducting an expense ratio of 0.58%, leaves you with roughly 6% in dividend profits annually -- an even bigger profit than was offered by my SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF pick last month.
Thus the ""net dividend"" you receive from owning SDIV is worth nearly three times the current 2.14% yield on the S&P 500. Valuationwise, this ETF's stocks carry an average P/E ratio of 13 -- which is also well below the S&P's average P/E of 20.
It may not give you all the international exposure of the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF. But I think that with a better return and more diversification, the Global X SuperDividend ETF is a fine bet to pay off.
Safety here, risk elsewhere
Reuben Gregg Brewer (iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF): When you build a portfolio, you're balancing one investment against the others you own. Your holdings interact, and if you aren't careful, you might end up with more risk than you think. This is why the iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF should be on your radar screen.    
I'm not going to lie -- it's kind of boring. But that's the point. The iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF owns exactly what its name implies. A preferred stock is an odd animal that sits above equity in the capital structure, but below debt. Generally speaking, preferreds are sold with a par value and a set dividend that has priority over common stock dividends. These securities tend to trade pretty close to par value (often $25) most of the time.
iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF has a heavy weighting in financials, an area that sees more preferreds issued than other sectors. Its trailing annualized returns over the three- and five-year periods through February, meanwhile, are both basically 6%. Its trailing yield is around 5.7%. Do the quick math and you'll see that most of your return is going to come from dividends. Which is pretty much what you'd expect of this asset class. 
But here's the fun part, iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF's standard deviation, a measure of volatility, over both those periods was a little over 4. Comparatively, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT:SPY) had a standard deviation of 10 in those periods. So the iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF provides a relatively large yield, price stability, and the opportunity to take on more risk elsewhere in your portfolio. It's a great option for the diversification balancing act.

                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-91472');
            });
        

Delectable combination of low risks and high dividends
Neha Chamaria (PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio): When I'm looking for high-yield stocks or ETFs, I prefer ones that offer an extra layer of security to those with sky-high yields that may carry substantial risk. Invesco's PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio is one such ETF I'd urge you to consider today.
As the name suggests, this ETF offers you nice dividends without the volatility that could give you sleepless nights. It does so by tracking the S&P 500 Low Volatility High Dividend Index, which comprises the 50 ""least-volatile high-dividend yielding"" stocks in the S&P 500 that are chosen based on the standard deviation of their daily prices over the trailing 252 trading days. So the highest-yielding stocks that were also the least volatile make it to the final 50. For an income investor, I think such an ETF is an excellent tool to earn secure income. In fact, if you compare PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio's performance since inception with that of an ETF that simply tracks the S&P 500, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, you can see how focus on low volatility helps.

SPHD Total Return Price data by YCharts
As you may have guessed, the PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio has the greatest exposure to defensive sectors: Utilities constitute  nearly 22% of the portfolio as of March 6, 2017. That aside, I also love the fact that this ETF has substantial exposure to REITs. While core real estate stocks can be volatile, REITs leverage investors to the growth potential in real estate while offering hefty dividends that aren't too risky because of the business structure. Not surprisingly, the Iron Mountain and Welltower Inc. REITs are currently the top two holdings of the ETF.
Then again, no single stock makes up more than 3% of the ETF's funds, which is also one reason it isn't too volatile. Given its low volatility and current SEC-defined yield of 3.74%, I think the PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio is a great pick to power up your income portfolio.

",3 High-Yield ETFs That Could Power Your Portfolio to the Next Level

What happened
Despite the S&P 500's flat finish to March, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock soared 15% during the month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
So what
While Shopify didn't announce anything major during March, the stock's overall rise likely reflects ongoing bullishness as investors and analysts digest the implications of the company's exceptional fourth quarter, as well as Shopify's overall massive growth last year.

Image source: Shopify.

In Shopify's fourth quarter, which was reported on Feb. 15, the company reported revenue of $130.4 million, up 86% year over year and well above a consensus analyst estimate for revenue of $121.6 million. One analyst from BTIG subsequently raised their price target for Shopify from $65 to $75 during March, likely driving some of the stock's increase during the month. BTIG analyst Abhinav Kapur said (via Benzinga) he believes Shopify is only in the early stages of its growth.
Shopify is trading at about $68 at the time of this writing, up about 58% this year.

            });
        

Now what
There's no doubt that Shopify is well positioned at the center of a key growth opportunity. As Shopify CFO Russ Jones articulated in the most recent quarterly earnings report, its 90% and 99% growth in revenue and gross merchandise volume, respectively, in 2016 ""speaks to the enormous opportunity retail right now and our strategic position within it.""
But with Shopify's stock trading so much higher recently, investors will want to ensure Shopify delivers on the market's high growth expectations. If the company's growth decelerates faster than expected, investors may want to reevaluate the stock's lofty valuation.

How Income Investor aims to find the best dividend payers on the market
Income Investor is led by advisor and Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Michael Olsen. Olsen, for his part, has worked on several other market-beating Motley Fool services, including Million Dollar Portfolio, Inside Value, and Special Ops, and is supported by two top-notch analysts in Paul Chi and Rana Pritanjali. Together, their primary goal through Income Investor is to find high-quality companies that can grow their dividends over time.
To be fair, there's no definitive guide for what makes an ideal Income Investor stock. But above all else, the team prioritizes the concepts of wealth preservation, capital appreciation, and -- as the their name suggests -- income generation.
""When viewed through that filter,"" Michael writes, ""dividend investments are well-suited: they've consistently registered the best risk-adjusted returns across long periods of time.""
Income Investor further hones its approach to dividend investing as follows:

Income Investor picks must pay a regular dividend. The team targets a 3% yield on average across all recommendations.
Generic businesses won't do. Income Investor looks for differentiated companies with wide, competitive moats. So it tends to follow that they offer ""must-have"" services and products.
Seek ""stealth value."" Income Investor doesn't just look for ""value"" or ""growth"" stocks, but wants to find ""good companies whose potential isn't quite appreciated, or is the subject of temporary disdain."" To that end, they try to find moats that are less obvious and continuing to grow, which often means looking closely at underappreciated small-cap and mid-cap stocks.
Partner well. This means finding companies whose management teams have a track record of capable capital allocation.
Consider less conventional dividends. Often this requires looking at ""dividend compounders,"" or companies that might currently pay a small dividend in an early stage industry, but have ample room to grow their payouts over time.
Strive to ""remain anchored"" by being brutally honest with themselves and avoiding attempts at being smarter than they are. As Michael writes, ""We're firmly committed to remaining within our circle of competence.""

When the rubber hits the road, Income Investor is able to use this methodology to provide members with one investment idea each month, ongoing coverage of its picks in real time, weekly updates with a recap of the previous week's news, and a thriving message-board community where you can interact with other members and the analyst team. Income Investor also maintains lists of Buy-Rated stocks from within its recommendation universe, as well as its ""Best Buys Now"" to highlight what they believe are the absolute best places for investors to put new money to work.
Finally, Income Investor encourages members to own stocks with a long-term mentality and avoid frequent trading. Especially in the case of dividend payers, this is the most effective way to let the magic of compounding returns to do its work.

We all know the feeling. You hear the rumble of the mail truck, and after it trundles away, you open your mailbox to find one of the big envelopes. It's too tall to be a bill, and too fat to be a birthday card. Congratulations! It's the quarterly portfolio statement from your broker!
But if you open it, you might find bad news.

Do you dread opening your mail to find papers that look like these? Three little stocks could put your mind at ease. Image source: Getty Images.

Wouldn't it be great, though, to know in your heart that the news won't be too bad? That even if the market has been going down, your stocks probably didn't go down as much as everyone else's did?
To help you achieve this kind of confidence, here's a stock screen aimed at finding stable companies:

Reasonably large, established companies, with $2 billion in market cap and up and recognizable brand names.
A respectable dividend -- at least 4%.
Stocks that don't zig and zag with every wobble in the stock market, showing a beta of less than 1.0.
Stocks that don't cost a lot -- at least 20% cheaper than the stock market's 26.5 P/E ratio .

What follows, I think, are three stocks that fit the bill. Go ahead -- read on and see if you agree.
Target 
Our first potential stock today is a name you know and maybe even love. One of America's largest retailers, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) does nearly $70 billion in business a year.
While business isn't always brisk, Target almost always manages to earn a profit. In fact, since the turn of the millennium, Target has lost money only once (in 2015), and reported an average of $2.2 billion profit over the 17 years. Last year, Target did even better, earning profits of $2.7 billion. And it's arguably even more profitable than it lets on. Data from S&P Global Market Intelligence show that Target generated positive cash earnings (free cash flow) of $3.9 billion last year -- 44% better than its reported profit.
In terms of valuation, Target stock costs only 11.4 times reported earnings, which is less than half the 26.1 average P/E on the S&P 500. The stock also sports a beta of just 0.5, which tells you that, historically at least, Target's stock price has proven more stable than its peers. Meanwhile, the stock pays a 4.5% dividend yield that's more than twice as generous as the 2.1% average dividend  on the S&P.
Invest in Target, and even a flat stock price can be expected to keep increasing the value of your portfolio -- thanks to that big, fat dividend.
Garmin 
Our second name is a real blast from the past: Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) -- the company that made GPS navigators famous before everyone started giving GPS software away free for your smartphone.
Now, you might think that shift in the market would have destroyed Garmin's business. And admittedly, it hasn't been great news for Garmin's automotive division. Yet years after the advent of free-on-phone-GPS map programs, Garmin is still around.
Recently it's managed to maintain a beta of only 0.84, indicating that the stock remains less volatile than others in the market.
How? By diversifying its business away from automotive mapping, and growing its other businesses, such as GPS products for boaters (where sales grew 16% last year), fitness enthusiasts (sales up 24%), and hikers (33% sales growth).
Today, Garmin stock sells for a below-average 18 times trailing earnings, while its dividend is decidedly above average -- 4.2% -- which is again twice the market average. If you're looking for a relatively cheap stock that has proved it can roll with the market's punches, not just survive but thrive, and pay dividends all along the way, check out Garmin's GPS coordinates. You might like what you find.

            });
        

New York Community Bancorp 
On that note, I'll end today's column with a little something for folks who like dividends -- and I mean really like dividends. The highest yielder on today's list, New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) pays a hefty 5.1% yield, while its stock itself costs only 13.3 times earnings.
As the name suggests, New York Community Bancorp is not a huge bank, but it's not tiny, either. Ranked by market capitalization, NYCB is the 31st or 32nd biggest  bank in the U.S. (depending on the day of the week you check its stock price). But it is a pretty stable banking stock, with a beta of just 0.6.
It's also a really good bank, boasting an efficiency ratio (operating expenses divided by net revenue) of 44.5%.
Finally, after the bank stumbled and reported a loss in 2015 because of a scotched merger attempt, analysts cited on S&P Global  generally agree that NYCB is now positioned to resume growing profits at a respectable 6.5% annualized rate. With that vote of confidence from Wall Street's best and brightest, New York Community Bancorp is the kind of stock that should make you happy to open your portfolio statements next quarter.

What happened
Despite the S&P 500's flat finish to March, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock soared 15% during the month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
So what
While Shopify didn't announce anything major during March, the stock's overall rise likely reflects ongoing bullishness as investors and analysts digest the implications of the company's exceptional fourth quarter, as well as Shopify's overall massive growth last year.

Image source: Shopify.

In Shopify's fourth quarter, which was reported on Feb. 15, the company reported revenue of $130.4 million, up 86% year over year and well above a consensus analyst estimate for revenue of $121.6 million. One analyst from BTIG subsequently raised their price target for Shopify from $65 to $75 during March, likely driving some of the stock's increase during the month. BTIG analyst Abhinav Kapur said (via Benzinga) he believes Shopify is only in the early stages of its growth.
Shopify is trading at about $68 at the time of this writing, up about 58% this year.

            });
        

Now what
There's no doubt that Shopify is well positioned at the center of a key growth opportunity. As Shopify CFO Russ Jones articulated in the most recent quarterly earnings report, its 90% and 99% growth in revenue and gross merchandise volume, respectively, in 2016 ""speaks to the enormous opportunity retail right now and our strategic position within it.""
But with Shopify's stock trading so much higher recently, investors will want to ensure Shopify delivers on the market's high growth expectations. If the company's growth decelerates faster than expected, investors may want to reevaluate the stock's lofty valuation.

In this crossover episode of Motley Fool Answers, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp are joined by fellow Motley Fool analyst Kristine Harjes, an avid healthcare sector enthusiast. Kristine is here to help Foolish investors get a handle on a complex but promising business: biotech. Tune in to find out how biotech firms differ from pharmaceuticals, why they're worthwhile investments, the major players, and more.
A full transcript follows the video.



This episode was recorded on April 4, 2017
Alison Southwick: This is Motley Fool Answers. I'm Alison Southwick and I'm joined, as always, by Robert Brokamp, personal finance expert here at The Motley Fool. We've got a special guest in the studio again today. It's Kristine Harjes. She's from Industry Focus, our other Motley Fool podcast. Hi!
Kristine Harjes: Hey, thanks for having me.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content1_desk-96102');
            });
        


Southwick: Thanks for coming. So she's here because she's going to help us do a deep dive into biotech stocks -- how to invest in them, the stocks to watch and more. All that ... and more ... on this week's episode on Motley Fool Answers! Whatever! It's fine! Go with it!
__
Southwick: It's time for Answers, Answers and today's question comes from Chris, our favorite dairy farmer in Minnesota. I think you like Chris' questions, because you've answered his questions before.
Robert Brokamp: I have, and it didn't occur to me as I was choosing this one, until I had sent it your way, that it was that Chris, but he's got good questions. What can I say? The cows bring it out in you, I guess.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content2_desk-65998');
            });
        


Southwick: Here you go. Chris writes: ""Is there any logic behind diversifying brokerages? I purchase stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds through a single brokerage. What would happen if that brokerage failed? I do like the consolidation factor with a single brokerage, but am I missing something?""
Brokamp: Well, Chris, first of all, I agree with you that there's some benefit in keeping a lot of your money with one brokerage. You only get one set of statements. Tax time is easier. Also, the more assets you have with one firm makes you more eligible for many discounts. No annual account fees. If you have a certain amount with a brokerage, they'll allow you maybe access to a CFP or a financial planner, so I think that makes sense. But you also have a good question in terms of what would happen if the brokerage failed.
Well, in would step the SIPC, which stands for the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. A lot of people think of it as like the FDIC for your brokerage. Like the FDIC, the insurance is not paid for by taxpayers but by the member firms. Just about every brokerage is required to have it.
What happens is if the brokerage fails (goes bankrupt or if there is some outright fraud), the SIPC will come in and first get the stuff that's still there (so any of the stocks and bonds that you owned) and move them to another brokerage firm. If for some reason something is missing, they will step in and replace it up to $500,000 and $250,000 worth could be in cash.



            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('div-content3_desk-19167');
            });
        


Southwick: Do they do this often?
Brokamp: They don't do it that often. They haven't done it in the last few years. The big things that they've had in the last few years are Lehman Brothers, for example, and every one of the account holders at Lehman Brothers got the contents of their accounts back.
The other big one they've been dealing with is Bernie Madoff. There's actually been some controversy, there, because SIPC only has about $2.5 billion in reserves. [That] is not a lot of money when you think of all the hundreds of billions of dollars in brokerage accounts, so there was some controversy about whether it is funded enough for that situation.
Of course, that was a problematic situation, because the whole value of the investment wasn't based on what your Apple stock did or your Disney stock did. You were just trusting that Bernie Madoff was saying that you have an account worth $1 million and you'd just say, ""OK, that's fine.""
For the average person with an average brokerage account, SIPC, I think, is fine, especially since most brokerage firms also have supplementary insurance on top of that ...
Southwick: Oh, OK ...
Brokamp: ... most often from Lloyd's of London. So you can go to your brokerage website and look up how much [of] your account is insured. In the approximately 40-year history of SIPC, there's only been about 350 people who were not completely made whole by the insurance, and [for] most of those folks, it happened in the 1970s when the account limits were lower.
I will say that the insurance just covers stocks, bonds, cash, and typical securities like that. It doesn't cover annuities. It doesn't cover futures contracts. It doesn't cover gold coins or anything like that, so you have to keep that in mind. But for most people, having all of your money with one brokerage account is pretty OK.
I personally would think that once I got to above that limit (like $500,000 or more at the brokerage), I might consider going to another brokerage, if for no other reason than different brokerages have different services. Different access. Different types of research. I might value having those other services.
Southwick: Investments like DRIPs ...
Brokamp: Right, things like that. But for the most part, I think having most of your money with one brokerage is perfectly OK.

Southwick: So The Motley Fool has a lot of podcasts -- like five. There's Motley Fool Money, Motley Fool Answers, Market Foolery, Rule Breaker Investing, and ...
Brokamp: And Industry Focus.
Southwick: And Industry Focus. So we thought it would be fun to, once a month, invite someone over from Industry Focus to talk about their industry and how best to invest in it. The first person who volunteered is Kristine Harjes, and she covers ... healthcare?
Harjes: Yes, healthcare more broadly and we are going to talk about biotech because why not just dive in headfirst?
Southwick: We could have gone with someone easy like consumer goods or tech but no. Motley Fool Answers listeners, you aren't ready for this, so buckle up, because we're going deep into biotech, yah?
Harjes: Let's do it.
Southwick: First off, though, let's have our listeners get to know you a little bit. Kristine, how did you come to The Motley Fool and how did you become an expert in biotech?
Harjes: I've been at The Motley Fool for about three years. I actually started here as an intern in business intelligence, which is so far removed from what I currently do. So I did that for a little while, and I loved the Fool and all of you wonderful people, here. I had so much fun during the internship and I didn't want to leave, but I knew I was not really suited to be a BI analyst. So I was like, ""Where might I be able to slide in and stay in this wonderful place?""
So I ended up on our Fool.com editorial team covering financials and healthcare. I'm not really sure why those were the two that were thrown my way. I don't know. Maybe that's just where the need was.
So I pretty much learned both of those industries from scratch when I started here and loved healthcare -- some find this incredibly boring -- and fortunately had the flexibility to pawn off the financial sector on another intern who became a full-time hire, Gaby Lapera, who now hosts the financials Industry Focus and I just get to focus on healthcare, which is what I love.
Southwick: That's interesting -- that this is what you love.
Harjes: I do.
Southwick: I'm excited to have you come here and share the love of investing in biotech.
Harjes: I can see it on your face.
Southwick: No, I am not skeptical at all. So we're just going to go for it, then.
Harjes: We're saving people's lives. It's an incredibly fascinating industry.
Southwick: Actually, out of all of the healthcare subsectors, biotech is probably the sexiest, right?
Harjes: Oh, big time.
Southwick: Like what does it mean to be a biotech stock?
Harjes: Biotech stocks are the ones that are making the drugs, and you can actually differentiate them from pharmaceutical companies based on the science of how to make the drugs. So pharmaceutical companies make pretty basic drugs. They're called small-molecule drugs. Biotech makes like living-organism-type drugs. They are made with actual biological components, and so those are your biotech drugs that are in development.
A lot of people assume that the whole biopharma world is one amorphous thing, which is kind of true, but technically a biotech works in making biologics.
Southwick: Biologics -- and I'm going to need you to explain that to me. A biologic, then, is different from a regular old drug in that it is ...
Harjes: It's a lot bigger. A type of molecule when you look at the chemical makeup of it. It's a lot harder to produce. Basically the method in which you make it is extremely important, and it's very hard to duplicate, and that's really all you need to know. I'm not a scientist. I am not going to even try to explain how you make these drugs. The thing that you need to know is that they are very complex. It's all about the process and they're hard to duplicate.
Southwick: So why should our listeners consider having biotech in their portfolio?
Harjes: I just think it's fun, so that's reason number one ...
Southwick: Whee!
Harjes: ... is that when you start to learn this stuff, it's so cool. It's such a fun industry. It's really interesting to watch. You have the IBB, which is the ETF that tracks the industry. It goes up and down, and up and down. But if you look at the long-term trend, it goes up a lot. If you look over the past five years, the IBB is up 140% and you can compare that to the S&P 500, which is up 68%. So there's another really good reason to have this in your portfolio, because you can generate a lot of returns using biotechs.
Brokamp: Back when I first got into the financial services industry (and this is back in the late 1990s), the big thing was invest to benefit from the aging of the baby boomers. Is that a big part of this, as well?
Harjes: Absolutely, and that is true for the entire healthcare sector, biotech and beyond. There are more people that are living longer, and with that there are more chronic diseases that need to be treated for a longer [period of time]. You just have this demographic tailwind providing a boost for the entire industry.
Southwick: What are some names that ... are there household names? What are some of the bigger names in biotech?
Harjes: Johnson & Johnson is a household name.
Southwick: Oh, yes, I have heard of that, yes.
Harjes: They are not really a biotech. Like they do some biologic drug development, but they also do Band-Aids and stuff like that. But as far as the biotech index goes (the IBB), the biggest components are Amgen, Celgene, Biogen, Gilead Sciences, and Regeneron. So I don't know. You tell me if those are household names. For me they are.
Southwick: They sound like companies from a Terminator movie.
Brokamp: Well, they sound like they're science fiction villains.
Southwick: Yeah!
Harjes: Biogen? Yeah.
Southwick: Like there's something about them where they sound just a little evil ...
Harjes: A little nefarious.
Southwick: ... and from the future.
Harjes: You know? I think some people do have the perception that these companies are a little bit evil.
Southwick: Why do you think that is?
Harjes: Because they charge such high prices.
Southwick: For drugs. Yeah.
Harjes: Because they charge such high prices. You've got this miracle hepatitis C cure (I'm looking at you, Gilead Sciences), and you're charging this much money for it. That's absurd. I am more on the side of the industry, here (I think I'm also totally biased just because of what I do), but I tend to believe that they do need to be compensated and have that incentive to continue their development of drugs, because otherwise who's going to find that miraculous cure?
Southwick: Right. So then is the industry -- like Celgene and these companies ... well, Johnson & Johnson, so they're huge. And I guess some subsection of them deals in biotechs. But then companies like Celgene. That's all they do, is focus on them? Then do they have one or two drugs that are huge, or do they have hundreds of drugs that are little?
Harjes: It's somewhere in between. Celgene has like four or five main, big drugs. They also have a much bigger pipeline. Most drugs that you try to develop and bring to market are going to fail, so most companies will always have a lot more that aren't approved yet and a handful (maybe between five, 10, or up to 20) really profit-driving drugs.
Southwick: Well, we brought you here to help us invest like a Fool in biotech, so let's start off with your first piece of advice. If someone wants to look into biotech, what should they know?
Harjes: So this is one that is applicable across any industry, but I think it's especially true in biotech, which is take out your emotions. To the extent that you can, do not get your stomach all tied up in a knot. And actually, if you're somebody that can't avoid having that sort of emotional reaction, this is probably not the industry for you.
You get stocks soaring on news from a super early development trial. You get stocks totally cratering, because they can't market their drugs. It's an extremely volatile industry, and the only way to really make a profit in a Foolish way is to long-term buy and hold these companies.
Southwick: And when you talk about buying and holding these companies, are you talking like the index? Like the IBB? Or like a basket of stuff? Like do you get a bunch to diversify your risk?
Harjes: It depends on what type of investor you are. If you want the least amount of risk while still exposing yourself to this industry, then the IBB is a great way to go. You can also go for one of the bigger, more established players. Or if you're enticed by these potential huge returns, then you can buy just a handful of the ones that you think look the most promising, cross your fingers, and keep following them. It's a risky industry, and you have to understand that, but it also can offer some really phenomenal returns if you choose wisely.
Southwick: Yes, that's the whole thing about risk and returns.
Harjes: That pesky risk, again.
Southwick: Aargh! That relationship!
Harjes: It just doesn't go away!
Southwick: No, it doesn't. All right, what's your next piece of advice for investing in biotechs?
Harjes: The next one that I have for you is follow the big money. What I mean by that is you probably, maybe, demographically speaking, are not a biochemistry Ph.D., so it might be kind of hard to look at what's going on with these drugs and know that it's super promising.
But what you can do is take a cue from other industry experts. Namely, if you look at a small biotech's partnerships with bigger ones, who's getting money? For example, if you look at, say, Ionis ... I know. It's a weird name. You're looking at me like what?
Southwick: It's fine. They're all just like a bunch of syllables smashed together.
Brokamp: You own a what?
Harjes: Their name actually used to be Isis, and they had to change it.
Southwick: Oh, yeah!
Harjes: The stock went from Isis Pharmaceuticals to Ionis Pharmaceuticals.
Brokamp: Did the Greek god sue them? What happened?
Harjes: Bad PR, I guess.
Brokamp: I guess.
Harjes: Anyway, Ionis is a relatively small biotech. I want to say the market cap is like $5 billion or so, and they have a ton of drugs that they're developing. So how do you know if this is a good platform or not? They do have a very unique platform they are using.
Well, they've got partnerships galore. They have one with Biogen, which is one of the big guys that I mentioned where I was listing key components of the IBB. Biogen and Ionis were able to bring the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy to market, and Biogen paid Ionis a ton of money, basically, to say, ""Hey, we think that this drug has a lot of promise. We want to continue giving you money as it develops, and then also we'll give you a royalty on the sales, eventually.""
For me, I look at that and I say, ""Hey, there's some really smart people at Biogen that like what they see at Ionis. That's a good sign.""
Southwick: Then you were thinking invest in Ionis, not necessarily Biogen? Or do you invest in both?
Harjes: It depends on what you're looking to do. Biogen is a more diversified, larger biotech. But if you are trying to figure out whether a relatively up-and-coming company has promise or not, this is one great way that you can get some insider info.
Southwick: And what's your final piece of advice for people looking to invest in biotech?
Harjes: My final thing that you need to keep an eye on, when you're looking at biotech, is cash burn. A lot of these companies are premarket. They haven't actually gotten anything approved yet, but they are spending money galore. They are just leaking millions and millions of dollars trying to develop these drugs.
And so it's really important that you actually pull up the balance sheet. You look at how much cash they have, how quickly they are spending it, and you can do some pretty rough math to figure out a cash runway. How long until they can't even keep the lights on. That is something that, when you're looking at biotech, is important with just about every company, but especially the premarket ones.
Southwick: Before we finish up here, what is a trend to watch in biotech right now?
Harjes: So one trend that I think is worth keeping an eye on is called biosimilars. Earlier in the show we were talking about biologic drugs and how they're super different than small molecule drugs and they're hard to duplicate. So that is where biosimilars come in.
They're a relatively new thing. They're basically the generic version of biologic drugs, which previously did not have generics, because it's so much about the manufacturing process that you can't trust somebody else to just go, ""Well, I'm going to whip up the same chemical ingredients and here I have a generic version.""
It's completely different, and it's a very new industry. We only have a handful of biosimilars that are approved in the U.S., but it will become a bigger and bigger trend, especially as these biologic drugs start to roll off patent protection.
Southwick: And how about a stock to watch?
Harjes: In biosimilars or in general?
Southwick: Whatever you want. It's your call.
Harjes: In general, I'm going to go with Cara Therapeutics. This is a company that's trying to market a non-addictive opioid-related pain medication. You hear that opioids are this enormous problem. So what Cara Therapeutics is doing is trying to make a painkiller that works, but that doesn't have the feel-good aspects of other opioid medications so that you don't get addicted to it. They're having a lot of success. So far the stock is up 114% just since the beginning of this year.
Southwick: Wow!
Harjes: So people are definitely catching on. There's a lot of buzz around this company, so I'm definitely keeping my eye on them, as well.
Southwick: Awesome. Well, thank you for helping us break down the industry. Do you want to stick around and have some fun with drug names?
Harjes: Let's do it.
Southwick: Let's have some fun with drugs.
__
Southwick: One of the most fun aspects of talking about biotech is trying to pronounce the drug names.
Harjes: It's probably my least favorite part of the podcast, actually, because half the time I don't know how to pronounce them.
Southwick: So what we're going to do is we're going to have a little fun. You're going to give us some drug names and we have to try and pronounce them correctly. Then you're going to tell us more about them.
Harjes: OK, I will spell them out for you. Here's number one: Alirocumab.
Brokamp: Well, I love that it has ""ali"" in the front of it, because it makes me think of you. It's a biosimilar, maybe. So we'll go with all-aru-cumab. All-aru-cumab.
Southwick: That's fine. All-aru-cumab. I'm going to try and put the emphasis on a different syl-lab-ble. Al-i-rok-i-mab.
Harjes: OK, I'll take it.
Brokamp: You have no idea.
Harjes: Here's how I would say it  which is Al-i-rok-i-mab, which is basically what you guys said. This is actually the chemical name for Praluent, which is this new type of cholesterol-lowering medication. Kind of a big deal drug as far as drugs go.
Brokamp: Al-i-rok-i-mab. What the heck.
Southwick: Al-i-rok-i-mab.
Brokamp: It doesn't even come close to rolling off the tongue.
Southwick: No, it does not.
Harjes: Ready for the next one?
Southwick: Yes.
Harjes: Number two is -- I almost just said it out loud. I'm going to spell it, now: Niraparib.
Southwick: Ner-rap-er-rib.
Brokamp: Nira-rap-peb. Nir-a-pay-rib.
Harjes: I also actually got pretty set on Ner-rap-er-rib.
Southwick: Yeah! Ner-rap-er-rib.
Harjes: And then I had a fun, little ...
Brokamp: That's a kids TV show. That's not a drug.
Harjes: I was able to find the pronunciation on the internet, which is super helpful.
Southwick: Oh, on the internet.
Harjes: So I can actually confirm that that's what that one is. We actually were just talking about this drug on Industry Focus on last Wednesday, but fortunately it now is approved, so it has a brand name which is Zejula, which I think is a little bit easier to pronounce than Niraparib.
Southwick: That is an alien race which is eventually going to exterminate us all.
Harjes: I have never seen so many z's and j's and x's until working in biotech.
Southwick: All right. Niraparib, also known as za-boom-la.
Brokamp: Za-za-baj-uva.
Harjes: So number three?
Brokamp: Number three.
Harjes: Nusinersen.
Southwick: New-sin-er-sin.
Brokamp: N. The first two letters are silent. Nuggi-ser-ess-sin.
Southwick: New-sin-erin-sin.
Harjes: I go with nu-sin-air-sin with this one.
Southwick: Nu-sin-air-sin.
Harjes: This is actually the drug I was talking about earlier on the show when I was talking about Biogen and Ionis. The SMA drug is this one, Nusinersen. Fun fact about it. It costs $750,000 for the first year of treatment.
Brokamp: What?
Southwick: Huh!
Harjes: And you have to take this drug for your entire life. So after that first year it costs $375,000 annually.
Southwick: Oh!
Brokamp: Holy shaving face.
Harjes: And that's why people hate drug makers.
Southwick: Wow! That's insane.
Brokamp: I understand it costs a lot of money to do these things. Most drugs don't make it. There has to be the economic incentive. It's when you start seeing the executive compensation that you lose sympathy for the companies.
Harjes: Yup, I get that.
Southwick: All right. You have one more for us?
Harjes: Yes, number four. Atorvastatin.
Southwick: Wow! OK! Oh, it's a statin drug.
Brokamp: It's Ator-, ator-va-statin.
Southwick: Ator-, ah, atora-va-statin.
Harjes: It's Atorvastatin, and you correctly identified that it is a statin. This is actually the generic name for Lipitor, which is the best-selling drug of all time.
Southwick: Oh!
Brokamp: Oh, really?
Southwick: So it's not like they just did smash syllables. There actually is like a code, here.
Harjes: There's a little bit of reason to it. For example, the first one, Alirocumab, that ends in ""mab."" That means it's a monoclonal antibody.
Brokamp: Of course.
Southwick: Of course it does.
Harjes: So there's a little bit of a science, kind of.
Brokamp: What about the x? Because there are a lot of x's in these things?
Harjes: If I had to guess -- you don't really get the X's in the chemical name. You get it in the brand name, and I think that's so you can differentiate the drugs, better, because you don't want a doctor accidentally writing the wrong prescription. Or you don't want the person that fills the prescription to accidentally read the wrong name. It's like an x is a very hard sound, and it makes a word sound different than any other related word.
Southwick: Right.
Brokamp: Maybe it had something to do with aren't prescriptions Rx? Doesn't that mean something?
Southwick: Yours is so much simpler. Let's go with that.
Brokamp: Let's find out what that means.
Rick Engdahl: People in these companies all hated Scrabble. That's why.
Harjes: They're trying to get the most points.
Southwick: Yeah.
Harjes: These were the fantastic Scrabblers.
Southwick: Oh, man. Before you go, leave us with your favorite ... this is something near and dear to Bro's heart. He loves weird side effects apparently. I just learned this about him when we were in the planning meeting for this. So what's your favorite drug side effect?
Harjes: So I think my absolute favorite drug side effect that I've ever heard of is ""loss of fingerprints.""
Southwick: How does that happen? They're not rubbing off, I assume.
Harjes: I have no idea. I don't think it leaves a mark somewhere, but I'm pretty sure it has to do with your fingers bloating for some water retention issues.
Southwick: Wow!
Harjes: Yeah, super weird. Oh, I have a second favorite one, too.
Southwick: OK, bring it.
Harjes: Which is you might become a compulsive gambler.
Southwick: What is that?
Harjes: I think this is a restless leg syndrome.
Brokamp: It's Mirapex. I have it right here because also increases gambling, sexual, or other overpowering urges and hallucinations may occur.
Southwick: Oh, wow!
Brokamp: So you may be at a party and you may be hallucinating that this person is attracted to you, and then bad things happen. It's very bad.
Southwick: Oh, wow!
Harjes: I also wonder if that's related to the gambling. Like are you hallucinating that you're winning a ton and that's why you keep doing it?
Brokamp: It could be.
Southwick: Oh, wow.
Brokamp: What I just looked up, thanks to Google ""why Rx is part of prescriptions."" It represents the Latin imperative verb 'recipe' which means take or take thou. There you go.
Southwick: Oh, that's fun.
Brokamp: Yeah.
Southwick: A lot of fun things people are learning. All right, so if you, our listeners, enjoyed learning about biotech, guess what? There's so much more to learn. And so you should start listening to Industry Focus. It's a Motley Fool podcast, and it takes a different sector every day of the week and breaks it down, and biotech/healthcare is on ...
Harjes: Wednesday.
Southwick: Wednesday. You can also listen the other days of the week ...
Harjes: They're OK.
Southwick: They're OK. But if you want more Kristine and learning more about healthcare stocks, I highly recommend subscribing to Industry Focus and paying close attention on Wednesdays. Kristine, thank you for joining us.
Harjes: Thank you so much for having me on. It's been fun.
Southwick: That's the show. I want to thank Brad from Kentucky who sent us a postcard from his trip to Ireland. I love it.
Brokamp: Oh, nice.
Southwick: The cards keep coming, even though I stopped asking for them. But spoiler: I will start asking for them again, come summer. So just know that the postcards make me insanely happy and I want to know where you guys vacation, because you guys vacation in really cool places.
All right. The show is edited biosimilarly by Rick Engdahl.
Brokamp: With no bad side effects.

The top dog in premium streaming and one of the market's hottest stocks over the past few years will be reporting fresh quarterly results next week. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reports after Monday's market close, and naturally, there's a lot riding on the dot-com darling's performance. 
Netflix has been on fire since recovering from the Qwikster fiasco in 2012. The stock was the S&P 500's biggest gainer in 2013 and 2015. The odds are stacked against it repeating the feat anytime soon. The shares are up a reasonable 16% so far in 2017, but trend watchers can't ignore how well the stock has fared in odd-numbered years -- since 2011 when it was smacked down hard.

Subs can be filling
Netflix is coming off of back-to-back blowout quarters, but Wall Street can't seem to agree on the platform's ability to grow its audience over the past three months. Goldman analyst Heath Terry issued new research on Wednesday, reiterating his buy rating and $170 price target. He feels Netflix will exceed its initial guidance calling for 1.5 million net additions in the U.S. and 3.7 million internationally.
History would suggest that it's smart for Wall Street pros to aim high. Netflix topped its subscriber targets by at least a million subscribers during the third and fourth quarters of last year. However, after falling short during the second quarter, not every analyst is sold on Netflix as a serial low-baller.
William Power at Baird turned heads last week when his firm's quarterly survey suggested that Netflix will fall short of expectations -- at least when it comes to Netflix's own target for 1.5 million net domestic additions. Terry and Power agree that proprietary content is the catalyst to woo new members, but they can't seem to agree on its efficacy this past quarter. Terry points out that 61 original or exclusive shows rolled out during the first quarter, but Power is concerned that none of them were blockbuster hits like House of Cards or Stranger Things have been in the past.

            });
        


You'll never see total agreement among analysts, and that's what makes the market tick. Power is neutral with a price target of $138 -- well below Terry at $170, and slightly less than what the stock is commanding these days. 
Netflix shares will be volatile after Monday afternoon's report. Back in mid-January, Netflix's goal for 5.2 million net additions would result in 99 million streaming subscribers worldwide. Waves will be made if Netflix can push that tally north of 100 million, though one may also wonder why Netflix didn't make that announcement if it had already hit that juicy, nine-figure milestone.
Buckle up. There's going to be a lot of moving around next week.

Though the memory chip market might seem like an investing backwater, it's actually one of the more interesting, dynamic areas of tech investing.
Thanks to the market's fierce competition, the companies that make memory chips, especially pure-play names like Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), tend to trade in boom-and-bust cycles that can lead to massive gains or losses for shareholders, depending on the exact timing of their investment.
However, finding the memory industry's best dividend name is a far simpler task since there is only one company tied to this space that also rewards its shareholders with cash distributions: Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF). In this article, we will review Samsung's memory business and examine its potential as a dividend stock.
Samsung and the memory market
The largest manufacturer of memory storage globally, Samsung's semiconductor sub-segment is arguably the crown jewel of its electronics empire, and memory likely drives the bulk of its chip business' performance. Let's dig a bit deeper to get a more precise sense of why memory matters to Samsung.
For those unfamiliar with the company's financial structure, the Korean electronics juggernaut organizes its operations around three main reporting segments: Consumer Electronics (CE), IT & Mobile communications (IM), and Devices Solutions (DS). Device Solutions includes Samsung's memory businesses. Importantly, sales of memory chips accounted for the largest portions of DS sales in 2016, and their 10% year-over-year growth rate was the highest among any segment or sub-segment at the company.

            });
        


Here's a quick snapshot into Samsung's financial performance in 2016 (in South Korean Won).

Looking to memory's impact on its bottom line, Samsung doesn't break out the sub-segment's results in its discussions of operating profits. However, a bit of back-of-the-envelope analysis suggests that memory sales provide about a quarter of Samsung's income from operations.
In referencing the charts above, we can see that memory chips accounted for 37 trillion Korean Won in revenue in 2016. Borrowing the net income margin from rival Micron Technology -- which derives all of its revenue from the sale of memory devices -- we know Micron generated a 22% profit margin in its most recent quarter. Applying Micron's profit margin to Samsung's 2016 memory sales implies that Samsung generated about 8.3 trillion Korean Won in operating profits from its memory business last year, or about 28% of its total operating profits. Though certainly imperfect, this suggests that memory is indeed an important profit center at Samsung -- and one that helps power the company's dividend payments to its shareholders.

Samsung as a dividend stock
Samsung might not seem like an appealing dividend stock, given that its 1.6% dividend currently sits below the 1.9% yield of the S&P 500. That being said, Samsung's dividend payments appear poised to meaningfully increase in the year to come for a few reasons.

            });
        


As I detailed in another recent article, Samsung recently found itself in the crosshairs of activist hedge fund firm Elliot Management, which had lobbied the Korean conglomerate to split itself into two separate publicly traded businesses. Rather than agreeing to do so, Samsung sought to quell the shareholder insurrection by pledging to increase the amount of capital it returns to shareholders, which will rise to about 50% of free cash flow this year, according to the company. 
Though I couldn't find free-cash-flow estimates for Samsung, sell-side analysts expect its sales and earnings per share (EPS) to increase by 9% and 72% respectively this year, according to data from Reuters. Though not scientific, this strongly suggests that the overall direction of Samsung's cash distributions are likely to increase, offering more appealing income generation than today's paltry yield certainly suggests.
At the end of the day, the memory chip space is far from an income investor's paradise. However, Samsung's robust memory business and its public pledges to increase the amount of capital it will return to shareholders indeed make it a compelling option among tech dividend stocks today.
